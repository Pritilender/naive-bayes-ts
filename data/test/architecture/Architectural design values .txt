architecture	architectural design values navigation search this article written like personal reflection opinion essay that states the wikipedia particular feelings about rather than the opinions experts please help improve rewriting encyclopedic style may architectural design values make important part what influences architects and designers when they make their design however architects and designers are not always influenced the same values and value and intentions differ between different architectural movements also differs between different schools architecture and schools design well among individual architects and designers the differences values and intentions are directly linked the pluralism design outcomes that exist within architecture and also big contributing factor how architect designer operates her relation different design values tend have considerable history and can found numerous design the influence that each design value has had design movements and individual designers has varied throughout contents aesthetic design values artistic aspects and expression the spirit the time design value the functional and material honesty design value the simplicity and minimalism design value the nature and organic design value the traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value the regionalism design value social design values the social change

design value mathematical and scientific design values see also further reading references aesthetic design values the expansion architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created diverse aesthetic reality within these two this pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such modernism postmodernism deconstructivism post structuralism neoclassicism new supermodernism all these aesthetic realities represent number divergent aesthetic addition differences general values and theories found within these some the stylistic distinctions found these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences design values and but this not the case for all stylistic some stylistic distinctions builds similar thinking and these aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are some degree reflection the development that has taken place the art more general changes have taken place western due technological new economic political changes however these diverse aesthetic expressions are also reflection individual architects and industrial personal based tendency experiment with materials and ornament create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic changes aesthetic styles and expressions have and still both synchronic and different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted number values which cannot classified aesthetic design values have influenced the development the aesthetic well contributed the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial aesthetic design contains seven artistic aspects and expression characterised belief that individual inner spiritual self and creative inner resources and should utilised the base used when these sentiments are closely linked number artistic values found movements like expressionism and the avant garde art thus this design value closely related abstract forms and personal creative elitism and being ahead the rest the spirit the time design value this design value based the conception that every age has certain spirit set shared attitudes that should utilised when the spirit the times denotes the intellectual and cultural climate particular which can linked experience certain sense collective consciousness and thus form which can some extent the given time and each should generate aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related that the functional and material honesty design value structural honesty linked the notion that structure shall display its purpose and not decorative functional honesty linked the idea that building product form shall shaped the basis its intended often known form follows function material honesty implies that materials should used and selected the bases their and that the characteristics material should influence the form used thus material must not used substitute for another material this subverts the materials properties and the the simplicity and minimalism design value this design value based the idea that simple forms aesthetics without considerable simple smooth surfaces represents forms which are both truer art and represents wisdom this design value implies that the more cultivated person the more decoration linked the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday thus contribute tranquillity and the nature and organic design value this design value based the idea that nature all sorts living numerical laws can provide functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use basis for designs based this value tend characterized flowing asymmetrical lines and expressive this design value can summed form follows the oppose the the traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value this value based belief that building and product should designed from timeless principles that transcend particular cultures and implicit this design value the notion that these forms are the public will appreciate timeless beauty and understand immediately how use given building this design value also linked regional differences varying climate and folklore which creates distinctive aesthetical the regionalism design value this design value based the belief that and some degree should designed accordance with the particular characteristics specific linked the aim achieving visual harmony between building and its well achieving continuity given other strives create connection between past and present forms finally this value also often related preserving and creating regional and national social design values many architects and industrial designers have strong motivation serve the public good and the needs the user moreover social awareness and social values within architecture and design some the emphasis these values are given society should noted that social values can have aesthetical but these aspects will not explored the main aesthetical impact found design has been covered the previous social design values are times conflict with other design this type conflict can manifest itself between different design but can also the cause conflicts within given design can argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between rationalism and romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial the social design values category consisting four design the social change design value this design value can described commitment change society for the better through architecture and industrial this design value closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building architects and industrial designers that are committed the design value social change often see their work tool for transforming the built environment and those who live the consultation and participation design value this design value based belief that beneficial involve stakeholders the design process this value connected belief that user involvement leads meeting social needs and effective use influencing the design process well awareness the consequences providing relevant and date information for the crime prevention design value this design value based the belief that the built environment can manipulated reduce crime which attempted accomplished through three main strategies that defensible crime prevention through environmental situational crime the third design value this based eagerness help developing countries through architecture and design response the needs the poor and destitute within the third world this design value implies that social and economic circumstances found the third world necessitate the development special which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed environmental design values the century has been marked the emergence environmental values within western citation needed concern for the environment not new and can found varying degree throughout and rooted number perspectives including the aim managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields sustainable and the idea that everything nature has intrinsic value nature protection and generally behind these types thinking are the concepts stewardship and that the present generation owes duties generations not yet environmental problems and challenges found the and centuries led development where environmental values became important some sections western therefore not surprising according that these values can also found among individual architects and industrial the focus environmental design has been marked with the rediscovery and further development many skills and citation needed new technology that approaches environmental concerns also important characteristic the environmental approach found among architects and industrial these rather different approaches environmental building and product technology can illustrated with the development environmental high tech architecture and the more environmental movement within ecological based environmental along with new environmental have affected development cities across the many cities have started formulate and introduce regulations concerning renewable energy sick smart recycled and this may not about all energy consumption europe and the however environmental concerns are not restricted energy environmental concerns take number perspectives which are reflected the focus found among architects and industrial the environmental design values category consists three design green and sustainability this value based belief that sustainable and environmentally friendly building approach beneficial society and future key concepts within this design value energy resource recycling cradle toxic free materials use and modification this based belief that existing and some degree can continuously used through within this value there are two separate schools thought with regards one camp focuses new elements that are sublimated overall and the other advocates for aesthetical dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the health this design value based the belief that the built environment can contribute ensuring healthy living environment built into this design are principles buildings should sites need distributed maximize the amount sunlight that reaches individual similarly there emphasis health based construction and reduction toxic emissions through selection appropriate traditional design values within both architecture and industrial design there long tradition being both inspired and use design elements existing buildings and this the case even many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity create new and novel design some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves inspired existing building and products and have even used this inspiration the main base for their designs this design tradition has considerable which can indicated many the labels associated with this this includes labels such classicism vernacular restoration and preservation indicated the previous section traditional and vernacular important element this tradition use and inspired already existing aesthetical elements and however the traditional approach also implies other aspects such functional preserving existing building traditions well individual buildings and the traditional design values consisting three distinct the tradition based design value this relies belief that traditional are the preferred typology and template for buildings and because they timeless and designs within this design value there are three main critical regionalist interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them abstracted modern revivalists adhering the most literal traditional contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings the design value restoration and preservation this based commitment preserve the best buildings and products for future this design value tends represent restoring building product its initial design and usually rooted three these archaeological perspective preserving buildings and products historical artistic perspective desire preserve something social perspective desire hold the familiar and the vernacular design value this value based belief that simple life and its closely linked are superior that the design value vernacular includes key concept such reinvigorating tradition evoking the reinventing tradition the search for new extending tradition using the vernacular modified reinterpreting tradition the use contemporary gender based design values this design values closely linked the feminist movement and theory developed within the and design values based gender are related three tenets found architecture and industrial which gender differences related critique and reconstruction architectural practice and the struggle for equal access jobs and recognition architecture and the focus gender based theories for the built the architectural and cultural value designers that adhere the design values based gender typically have focus creating buildings that not have the same barriers that parents and the elderly experience much the built also implies focus aesthetics that are deemed more than the aesthetics often created male the economic design value many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side architecture and industrial design their focus often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic this the basis for design value that can characterised charrette this value commonly found among practising architects and the value founded the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged accountant and normal implicit the value are elements the following claim best design works comes from offices individual designers which are willing put overtime sometimes for the sake the design good architecture and design rarely possible within fees offered architects and designers should care enough about buildings products uphold high design standards regardless the payment the design value can seen reaction and rejection the influence and control over the design the novel design value common within contemporary architecture and industrial design find emphasis creating novel design this emphasis often accompanied equally common lack emphasis studying the appropriateness any already existing design the novel design value has historical roots dating back early design movements such modernism with emphasis starting from the celebration original and novel design solutions many designers and design considered one the main aspects architecture and this design value often manifested through the working methods some architects and designers with their emphasis the big will have tendency cling major design ideas and even these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable however the emphasis design novelty also associated with progress and new design solutions without this would not see the light the design value novelty not generally accepted within either architecture this indicated the debate focusing whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings that they are situated equally the debate where architecture should based traditional topology and design styles classical and vernacular base architecture should expression its the same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where has been debated retro design should accepted not good mathematical and scientific design values movement base architectural design scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work christopher alexander the notes the synthesis form other contributors joined especially investigations form the urban which resulted important developments such bill space syntax and michael work spatial analysis the volume work the nature order alexander summarizes his most recent alternative architectural theory based scientific for example theory architecture now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common architectural this entire body work can seen balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and the same the scientific results that determine this approach fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions way that purely historical appreciation social and environmental issues are given new drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity groups and individuals with their built the new discipline biophilia developed wilson plays major role explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living this insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides new understanding for the need for ecological extension the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts biological these mathematical
