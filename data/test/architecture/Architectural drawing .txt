historical this context the site plan forms part legal and there may requirement for drawn licenced architect engineer landscape architect land panth paris elevation elevation view building seen from one flat representation one ade this the most common view used describe the external appearance each elevation labelled relation the compass direction the north elevation building the side that most closely faces buildings are rarely simple rectangular shape typical elevation may show all the parts the building that are seen from particular geometrically elevation horizontal orthographic projection building vertical the vertical plane normally being parallel one side the architects also use the word elevation synonym for ade the north elevation literally the facing wall the observatorium cross section cross section also simply called represents vertical plane cut through the the same way floor plan horizontal section viewed from the the section everything cut the section plane shown bold often with solid fill show objects that are cut and anything seen beyond generally shown thinner sections are used describe the relationship between different levels the observatorium drawing illustrated the section shows the dome which can seen from the second dome that can only seen inside the and the way the space between the two accommodates large astronomical relationships that would difficult understand from plans sectional elevation combination cross with elevations other parts the building seen beyond the section geometrically cross section horizontal orthographic projection building vertical with the vertical plane cutting through the isometric and axonometric projections isometric and axonometric projections are simple way representing three dimensional keeping the elements scale and showing the relationship between several sides the same that the complexities shape can clearly there some confusion about the terms isometric and axonometric word that has been used architects for hundreds engineers use the word axonometric generic term include diametric and trimetric this article uses the terms the specific despite fairly complex geometrical for the purposes practical draughting the difference between isometric and axonometric simple see diagram the plan drawn skewed rotated and the verticals are projected vertically the all lines are drawn scale that relationships between elements are many cases different scale required for different axes and again this can calculated but practice was often simply estimated isometric uses plan grid degrees from the horizontal both which distorts the plan isometric graph paper can used construct this kind this view useful explain construction details three dimensional joints the isometric was the standard view until the mid twentieth remaining popular until the especially for textbook diagrams and cabinet projection but only one axis the others being horizontal and originally used cabinet the advantage that principal side cabinet displayed without only the less important sides are the lines leading away from the eye are drawn reduced scale lessen the degree the cabinet projection seen victorian engraved advertisements and architectural but has virtually disappeared from general axonometric uses degree plan which keeps the original orthogonal geometry the the great advantage this view for architecture that the draughtsman can work directly from without having reconstruct skewed theory the plan should set degrees but this introduces confusing coincidences where opposite corners unwanted effects can avoided rotating the plan while still projecting this sometimes called planometric plan oblique and allows freedom choose any suitable angle present the most useful view traditional draughting techniques used and degree set squares and that determined the angles used these once the adjustable square became common those limitations were the axonometric gained popularity the twentieth not just convenient diagram but formal presentation adopted particular the modern movement axonometric drawings feature prominently the influential drawings michael graves james stirling and using not only straightforward views but eye unusually and exaggerated rotations the and exploded the axonometric view not readily generated cad programmes which create views from three dimensional consequently now rarely detail drawings detail drawings show small part the construction larger show how the component parts fit they are also used show small surface for example decorative section drawings large scale are standard way showing building construction typically showing complex junctions such floor wall window eaves and roof that cannot clearly shown drawing that includes the full height the full set construction details needs show plan details well vertical section one detail seldom produced set details shows the information needed understand the construction three typical scales for details are and full traditional many details were fully that few detail drawings were required construct for the construction sash window would left the who would fully understand what was but unique decorative details the facade would drawn modern buildings need fully detailed because the proliferation different methods and possible architectural perspective robert adam perspective drawing approximate representation flat surface image perceived the the key concepts here perspective the view from particular fixed horizontal and vertical edges the object are represented horizontals and verticals the lines leading away into the distance appear converge vanishing point all horizontals converge point the horizon which horizontal line eye verticals converge point either above below the the basic categorization artificial perspective the number vanishing one point perspective where objects facing the viewer are and receding lines converge single vanishing two point perspective reduces distortion viewing objects with all the horizontal lines receding one two vanishing both located the three point perspective introduces additional realism making the verticals recede third vanishing which above below depending upon whether the view seen from above the normal convention architectural perspective use point with all the verticals drawn verticals the three point perspective gives photographic snapshot professional architectural photography conversely view camera perspective control lens used eliminate the third vanishing that all the verticals are vertical the with the perspective this can also done digital manipulation photograph taken with standard aerial perspective technique for indicating distance approximating the effect the atmosphere distant ordinary object gets further from the its contrast with the background its colour saturation and its colour becomes more not confused with aerial view eye which the view seen from high vantage perspective the bank england see illustration the beginning this gandy portrayed the building picturesque ruin order show the internal plan precursor the cutaway montage image produced superimposing perspective image building photographic care needed record the position from which the photograph was and generate the perspective using the same this technique popular computer where the building can photorealistically rendered and the final image intended almost indistinguishable from sketches and diagrams sketch rapidly executed freehand quick way record and develop not intended finished diagram may also drawn freehand but deals with develop the logic both may worked into more presentable form and used communicate the principles the finished work expensive and time important resolve the design fully possible before construction work complex modern buildings involve large team different specialist and communication the early design stages essential keep the design moving towards coordinated architects and other start investigating new design with sketches and develop rough design that provides adequate response the particular design there are two basic elements building the aesthetic and the the aesthetic element includes the layout and visual the anticipated feel the and cultural references that will influence the way people perceive the practical concerns include space allocated for different how people enter and move around the daylight and artificial acoustics traffic legal matters and building and many other while both aspects are partly matter customary every site many architects actively seek thereby increasing the number problems architectural legend often refers designs made the back cigarette initial thoughts are even they have discarded along the because they provide the central idea around which the design can although sketch disposable and allows for freedom for trying different ideas choice becomes sharply reduced once the design committed scale and the sketch stage almost always diagrams are mainly used resolve practical the early phases the design architects use diagrams explore and communicate ideas and they are essential tools for problem and communication the design diagrams can used resolve spatial but they can also represent forces and the forces sun and the flows people and materials through exploded view diagram shows component parts assembled some that each can seen its these views are common technical but are also used either conceptual diagrams illustrate technical cutaway view parts the exterior are omitted show the details internal although common technical including many building products and the cutaway fact used architectural types architectural drawing architectural drawings are produced for specific and can classified several elements are often included the same for example sheet showing plan together with the principal presentation drawings drawings intended explain scheme and promote its working drawings may include tones hatches emphasise different but they are not intended appear basic presentation drawings typically include vehicles and taken from library such and are otherwise very similar style working rendering the art adding surface textures and shadows show the visual qualities building more architectural illustrator graphic designer may employed prepare specialist presentation usually perspectives highly finished site floor plans and elevations survey drawings measured drawings existing structures and architects need accurate set survey drawings basis for their working establish exact dimensions for the construction surveys are usually measured and drawn specialist land surveyors record drawings historically architects have made record drawings order understand and emulate the great architecture known the architects from all over europe studied and recorded the remains the roman and greek and used these influences develop the architecture the records are made both for local and large scale for historic surveys worth referring colen campbell vitruvius brittanicus illustrations english buildings inigo jones and sir christopher wren well campbell himself and other prominent architects the the survey london founded charles robert ashbee and now available through english heritage record notable streets and individual buildings the former county historic american buildings survey records notable buildings drawn during the depression this collection held the library congress and available free the record drawings are also used construction where drawings the completed building take account all the variations made during the course working drawings comprehensive set drawings used building construction these will include not only drawings but structural and services drawings working drawings logically subdivide into assembly and component location also called general arrangement include floor sections and they show where the construction elements are assembly drawings show how the different parts are put for example wall detail will show the layers that make the how they are fixed structural how finish the edges and how prefabricated components are component drawings enable contained elements windows and fabricated and delivered site complete and ready for larger components may include roof cladding cupboards and complete especially hotel bedrooms and may made prefabricated pods complete with internal decorations and traditionally working drawings would typically combine sections elevations and some details provide complete explanation building one that was possible because little detail was the building techniques involved being common knowledge amongst building modern working drawings are much more detailed and standard practice isolate each view separate notes included drawings are referring standardised specification documents for more understanding the layout and construction modern building involves studying sizeable set drawings and drafting until the latter part the twentieth all architectural drawings were manually either architects trained but less draughtsmen drafters who did not generate the although they made many the less important this system continues with cad many design architects have little knowledge cad software programmes and rely upon others take their designs beyond the sketch draughtsmen may specialize type such residential type timber reinforced prefabrication the traditional tools the architect were the drawing board draughting square and set squares protractor compasses pencil and drawing pens different drawings were made vellum coated linen and tracing paper lettering would either done mechanically using stencil combination the ink lines were drawn with ruling pen relatively sophisticated device similar pen but with adjustable line capable producing very fine controlled line ink pens had dipped into ink draughtsmen worked standing and kept the ink separate table avoid spilling ink the citation needed twentieth century developments include the parallel motion drawing and more complicated improvements the basic the development reliable technical drawing pens allowed for faster draughting and stencilled letraset dry transfer lettering and tone sheets were popular from the until computers made those processes computer aided design computer aided design the use computer software create today the vast majority technical drawings all kinds are made using instead drawing lines the computer records equivalent information there are many advantages this repetition reduced because complex elements can duplicated and stored for errors can and the speed draughting allows many permutations tried before the design the other cad drawing encourages proliferation detail and increased expectations aspects which reduce the efficiency originally expected from the move professional cad software such autocad complex and requires both training and experience before the operator becomes fully consequently skilled cad operators are often divorced from the design simpler software such sketchup allows for more intuitive drawing and intended design cad used create all kinds from working drawings photorealistic perspective architectural renderings also called are made creating dimensional model using the model can viewed from any direction find the most useful different software for example autodesk max then used apply colour and texture and represent shadows and the result can accurately combined with photographic people cars background building information modeling the logical development cad relatively new technology but fast becoming the design team collaborates create dimensional computer and all plans and other dimensional views are generated directly from the ensuring spatial the key innovation here share the model via the that all the design functions site architecture structure and can integrated into single series models associated with each specialism that are shared throughout the design development some form not necessarily the needs place resolve conflicting the starting point bim spatial but also enables components quantified and scheduled directly from the information embedded the architectural animation short film showing how proposed building will the moving image makes dimensional forms much easier animation generated from series hundreds even thousands still each made the same way architectural generated building created using cad and that used create more less realistic views from sequence the simplest animations use moving while more complex animations can include moving people vehicles and architectural reprographics architectural reprography reprographics reprography covers variety media and support services used make multiple copies original prints architectural drawings are still sometimes called blueprints after one the early processes which produced white line blue the process was superseded the line print system which prints black white coated paper whiteprint the standard modern processes are the ink jet printer laser printer and photocopier which the jet
