architecture	naval architecture navigation search this article includes list references related reading external links but its sources remain unclear because lacks inline citations please improve this article introducing more precise march tahitian princess rshavn faroe islands naval architecture also known naval engineering engineering discipline dealing with the construction maintenance and operation marine vessels and naval architecture involves basic and applied design development design evaluation and calculations during all stages the life marine preliminary design the its detailed construction trials operation and launching and dry docking are the main activities ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified means rebuilding modernization naval architecture also involves formulation safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification ship designs meet statutory and statutory contents main subjects hydrostatics hydrodynamics structures arrangements construction science and craft the naval architect see also references external links main subjects the word vessel includes every description watercraft including displacement wig craft and seaplanes used capable being used means transportation water the principal elements naval architecture hydrostatics hydrostatics concerns the conditions which the vessel subjected while rest water and its ability remain this involves computing buoyancy displacement and other hydrostatic trim the measure the longitudinal inclination the stability the ability vessel restore itself upright position after being inclined sea loading hydrodynamics hydrodynamics concerns the flow water around the hull bow stern and over bodies such propeller blades rudder through thruster resistance resistance towards motion water primarily caused due flow water around the powering calculation done based propulsion move the vessel through water using propellers thrusters water jets sails etc engine types are mainly internal combustion some vessels are electrically powered using nuclear solar energy ship motions involves motions the vessel seaway and its responses waves and controllability involves controlling and maintaining position and direction the vessel structures structures involves selection material structural analysis global and local strength the vibration the structural components and structural responses the vessel during motions seaway arrangements arrangements involves concept design layout and fire protection allocation ergonomics and capacity construction construction depends the material when steel aluminium used this involves welding the plates and profiles after rolling marking cutting and bending per the structural design drawings followed erection and launching other joining techniques are used for other materials like fibre reinforced plastic and glass reinforced plastic science and craft uss kitty hawk naval architecture has been more craft than the suitability shape was judged looking model vessel ungainly shapes abrupt transitions were frowned being this included deck and even subjective descriptors such full and fine were used substitute for the more precise terms used vessel and still described having shape the term meant denote not only smooth transition from fore aft but also shape that was determining what particular situation the absence definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art naval architecture this modern cost digital computers and dedicated software combined with extensive research correlate towing tank and computational have enabled naval architects more accurately predict the performance marine these tools are used for static stability intact and dynamic resistance powering hull structural analysis green water and slamming data regularly shared international conferences sponsored rina society naval architects and marine engineers and computational fluid dynamics being applied predict the response floating body random the naval architect cosco xiamen due the complexity associated with operating marine naval architecture operative effort between groups technically skilled individuals who are specialists particular often coordinated lead naval this inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing cars and even this due primarily the paucity data the environment the marine vehicle required work and the complexity the interaction waves and wind marine naval architect engineer who responsible for the construction and repair boats other marine and offshore both commercial and including merchant ships oil tankers gas tankers cargo ships bulk carriers container ships vehicle ferries cruise ships warships frigates destroyers aircraft carriers amphibious ships submarines and underwater vehicles icebreakers high speed craft hovercraft multi hull ships hydrofoil craft workboats barges fishing boats anchor handling tug supply vessels platform supply vessels tug boats pilot rescue craft yachts power and other recreational watercraft offshore platforms and subsea developments some these vessels are amongst the largest such supertankers most complex such aircraft carriers and highly valued movable structures produced they are typically the most efficient method transporting the raw materials and modern engineering this scale essentially team activity conducted specialists their respective fields and naval architects integrate these this demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability bring together the conflicting demands the various design constraints produce product which fit for the addition this leadership naval architect also has specialist function ensuring that economic environmentally sound and seaworthy design undertake all these naval architect must have understanding many branches engineering and must the forefront high technology she must able effectively utilize the services provided lawyers accountants and business people many naval architects typically work for shipyards ship design firms
