etymology the origin the name from the greek word parthenon which referred the unmarried house and the case seems have been used first only for particular room the debated which room this and how the room acquired its the jones greek english lexicon states that this room was the western cella the jamauri green holds that the parthenon was the room which the peplos presented athena the panathenaic festival was woven the arrephoroi group four young girls chosen serve athena each christopher pelling asserts that athena parthenos may have constituted discrete cult intimately connected but not identical that athena polias according this the name parthenon means the temple the virgin and refers the cult athena parthenos that was associated with the the epithet parth nos greek whose origin also meant girl but also unmarried and was especially used for artemis the goddess wild the and and for the goddess strategy and handicraft and practical has also been suggested that the name the temple alludes the maidens parthenoi whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety the the first instance which parthenon definitely refers the entire building found the writings the century orator demosthenes century building the structure simply called naos the the architects mnesikles and callicrates are said have called the building hekatompodos the hundred their lost treatise athenian and the century and the building was referred the hekatompedos the hekatompedon well the the century writer plutarch referred the building the hekatompedon parthenon because the parthenon was dedicated greek goddess has sometimes been referred the temple the roman name for particularly during the function although the parthenon architecturally temple and usually called not really one the conventional sense the small shrine has been excavated within the the site older sanctuary probably dedicated athena way get closer the but the parthenon never hosted the cult athena patron the cult image which was bathed the sea and which was presented the peplos was olivewood xoanon located older altar the northern side the the colossal statue athena phidias was not related any cult and never inspired any recorded religious did not seem have any altar cult according thucydides pericles once referred the statue gold stressing that contained forty talents pure gold and was all the athenian statesman thus implies that the obtained from contemporary could used again without any the parthenon should then viewed grand setting for the votive statue phidias rather than cult said many writings the greeks that there were many treasures stored inside the such persian and small statue figures made precious early history older parthenon older parthenon the first endeavor build sanctuary for athena parthenos the site the present parthenon was begun shortly after the battle marathon upon muscular limestone foundation that extended and leveled the southern part the acropolis this building replaced hekatompedon meaning and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated athena polias the the older parthenon frequently referred was still under construction when the persians sacked the city and razed the the existence both the parthenon and its destruction were known from herodotus and the drums its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north the erechtheum further material evidence this structure was revealed with the excavations panagiotis kavvadias the findings this dig allowed wilhelm rpfeld then director the german archaeological assert that there existed distinct substructure the original called parthenon not immediately below the present edifice had been previously observation was that the three steps the first parthenon consisted two steps poros the same the and top step karrha limestone that was covered the lowest step the periclean this platform was smaller and slightly the north the final indicating that was built for wholly different now completely covered this picture was somewhat complicated the publication the final report the excavations indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the kimonian and implying later date for the first the original parthenon was indeed destroyed invites the question why the site was left ruin for three one argument involves the oath sworn the greek allies before the battle plataea declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed the persians would not oath from which the athenians were only absolved with the peace callias the mundane fact the cost reconstructing athens after the persian sack least likely however the excavations bert hodge hill led him propose the existence second begun the period kimon after hill claimed that the karrha limestone step rpfeld thought was the highest parthenon was fact the lowest the three steps parthenon whose stylobate dimensions hill calculated metres one difficulty dating the parthenon that the time the excavation the archaeological method seriation was not fully the careless digging and refilling the site led loss much valuable attempt make sense the potsherds found the acropolis came with the volume study graef and langlotz published this inspired american archaeologist william bell dinsmoor attempt supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the terracing the dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for parthenon was earlier than contradicting the early date given further dinsmoor denied that there were two and that the only periclean temple was what rpfeld referred parthenon dinsmoor and rpfeld exchanged views the american journal archaeology present building the century when the athenian acropolis became the seat the delian league and athens was the greatest cultural centre its pericles initiated ambitious building project that lasted the entire second half the the most important buildings visible the acropolis the the the erechtheion and the temple athena were erected during this the parthenon was built under the general supervision the artist phidias who also had charge the sculptural the architects ictinos and callicrates began their work and the building was substantially completed but work the decorations continued until least some the financial accounts for the parthenon survive and show that the largest single expense was transporting the stone from mount pentelicus about kilometres from the the funds were partly drawn from the treasury the delian which was moved from the panhellenic sanctuary delos the acropolis architecture the parthenon peripteral octostyle doric temple with ionic architectural stands platform stylobate three common with other greek post and lintel construction and surrounded columns peripteral carrying entablature there are eight columns either end octostyle and seventeen the there double row columns either the colonnade surrounds inner masonry the cella which divided into two

support the the the doric columns measure metres diameter and are metres high the corner columns are slightly larger the parthenon had outer pillars and inner pillars each pillar containing flutes flute the concave shaft carved into the pillar the stylobate has upward curvature towards its centre millimetres the east and west and millimetres the the roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known imbrices and tegulae the parthenon regarded the finest example greek the wrote john julius cooper enjoys the reputation being the most perfect doric temple ever even its architectural refinements were especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature the stylobate the taper the naos walls and the entasis the entasis refers the slight diminution diameter the columns they though the observable effect the parthenon considerably more subtle than earlier the stylobate the platform which the columns many other classical greek has slight parabolic upward curvature intended shed rainwater and reinforce the building against the columns might therefore supposed lean but they actually lean slightly inwards that they carried they would meet almost exactly mile above the centre the since they are all the same the curvature the outer stylobate edge transmitted the architrave and roof all follow the rule being built delicate gorham stevens observed when pointing out the west front was built slightly higher level than that the east not universally agreed what the intended effect these optical was they may serve sort reverse optical the greeks may have been two parallel lines appear curve when intersected converging this the ceiling and floor the temple may seem bow the presence the surrounding angles the striving for the designers may have added these compensating for the illusion creating their own thus negating this effect and allowing the temple seen they also suggested that was enliven what might have appeared inert mass the case building

pediment were destroyed even before jacques carrey created otherwise useful documentary drawings all reconstructions are subject conjecture and the main olympian gods must have stood around zeus and athena watching the wondrous with hephaestus and hera probably near the carrey drawings are instrumental reconstructing the sculptural arrangement beyond the center figures the north and west pediment

piece sculpture from the parthenon known from the hand phidias was the statue athena housed the naos this massive chryselephantine sculpture now lost and known only from vase gems literary descriptions and later history late antiquity major fire broke out the parthenon shortly after the middle the third century which destroyed the roof and much the repairs were made the fourth century possibly during the reign julian the apostate new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed cover the sloped greater incline than the original roof and left the wings the parthenon survived temple dedicated athena for close thousand years until theodosius decreed that all pagan temples the byzantine empire some point the fifth athena great cult image was looted one the emperors and taken constantinople where was later possibly during the siege constantinople during the fourth crusade christian church the parthenon was converted into christian church the final decade the sixth century become the church the parthenos maria virgin the church the theotokos mother god the orientation the building was changed face towards the the main entrance was placed the western end and the christian altar and iconostasis were situated towards the eastern side adjacent apse built where the pronaos was formerly large central portal with surrounding doors was made the wall dividing the which became the nave from the rear the narthex the spaces between the columns the opisthodomus and the peristyle were walled though number doorways still permitted icons were painted the walls and many christian inscriptions were carved into the these renovations inevitably led the removal and dispersal some the those depicting gods were either possibly interpreted according christian removed

his final victory over the bulgarians for the sole purpose worshipping the medieval greek accounts called the temple theotokos atheniotissa and often indirectly referred famous without explaining exactly which temple they were referring thus establishing that was indeed the time the latin occupation became for about years roman catholic church our lady during this period used either watchtower

defending the acropolis until june when surrendered the the turks may have briefly restored the parthenon the greek orthodox christians for continued use some time before the close the fifteenth century the parthenon became the precise circumstances under which the turks appropriated for use mosque are one account states that mehmed ordered its conversion punishment for athenian plot against ottoman the apse became mihrab the tower previously constructed during the roman catholic occupation the parthenon was extended upwards become minbar was the christian altar and iconostasis were and the walls were whitewashed cover icons christian saints and other christian despite the alterations accompanying the conversion into church and subsequently its structure had remained basically the turkish traveler evliya elebi expressed marvel the sculptures and figuratively described the building like some impregnable fortress not made human composed poetic supplication that work less human hands than heaven should remain standing for all the french artist jacques carrey visited the acropolis and sketched the sculptural early engineer named plantier sketched the parthenon for the frenchman graviers these particularly those made provide and sometimes the evidence the condition the parthenon and its various sculptures prior the devastation suffered late and the subsequent looting its art destruction edward dodwell views greece the parthenon was extensively damaged the greatest catastrophe befall its long the venetians sent expedition led francesco morosini attack athens and capture the the ottoman turks fortified the acropolis and used the parthenon gunpowder magazine despite having been forewarned the dangers this use the explosion that severely damaged the propylaea and shelter for members the local turkish september venetian mortar fired from the hill blew the and the building was partly the explosion blew out the central portion and caused the walls crumble into greek architect and archaeologist kornilia chatziaslani writes that three the four walls nearly collapsed and fifths the sculptures from the frieze nothing the roof apparently remained six columns from the south side eight from the well whatever remained from eastern except for one the columns brought down with them the enormous marble triglyphs and about three hundred people were killed the which showered marble fragments over nearby turkish defenders and caused large fires that burned until the following day and consumed many accounts written the time conflict over whether this destruction was deliberate one such written the german officer states that turkish deserter revealed morosini the use which the turks had put the parthenon expecting that the venetians would not target building such historic morosini was said have responded directing his artillery aim the subsequently morosini sought loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage the sculptures poseidon and horses fell the ground and smashed his soldiers tried detach them from the west the following the venetians abandoned athens avoid confrontation with large force the turks had assembled chalcis that the venetians had considered blowing what remained the parthenon along with the rest the acropolis deny its further use fortification the but that idea was not after the turks had recaptured the acropolis they used some the rubble produced this explosion erect smaller mosque within the shell the ruined for the next century and portions the remaining structure were looted for building material and any remaining objects the century was period ottoman stagnation many more europeans found access and the picturesque ruins the parthenon were much drawn and spurring rise
