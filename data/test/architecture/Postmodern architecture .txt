quarter the century some architects started turn away from modern functionalism which they viewed and which some the public considered unwelcoming and even these architects turned towards the quoting past aspects various buildings and melding them together even sometimes inharmonious create new means designing vivid example this new approach was that postmodernism saw the comeback columns and other elements premodern sometimes adapting classical greek and roman examples but not simply recreating was done neoclassical architecture modernism the traditional column design was treated cylindrical pipe replaced other technological means such cantilevers masked completely curtain wall ades the revival the column was aesthetic rather than necessity modernist rise buildings had become

extended include communicating ideas with the public often then humorous witty often the communication done quoting extensively from past architectural often many breaking away from also strives produce buildings that are sensitive the context within which they are postmodernism has its origins the perceived failure modern architecture its preoccupation with functionalism and economical building meant that ornaments were done away with and the buildings were cloaked stark rational many felt the buildings failed meet the human need for comfort both for body and for the that modernism did not account for the desire for the problem worsened when some already monotonous apartment blocks degenerated into slums architects sought reintroduce color decoration and human scale form was longer defined solely its functional requirements minimal changing pedagogies critics the reductionism modernism often noted the abandonment the teaching architectural history causal the fact that
