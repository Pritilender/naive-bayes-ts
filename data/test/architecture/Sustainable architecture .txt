photovoltaic cells wastewater treatment rainwater collection solar hot water passivhaus kansas energy efficiency over the entire life cycle building the single most important goal sustainable architects use many different techniques reduce the energy needs buildings and increase their ability capture generate their own heating ventilation and cooling system efficiency the most important and cost effective element efficient heating ventilating and air conditioning system well insulated building more efficient building requires less heat generating dissipating but may require more ventilation capacity expel polluted indoor air significant amounts energy are flushed out buildings the air and compost streams off the shelf site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture energy from waste hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water fresh recapture energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized anaerobic digesters hvac systems are powered copper versus other metal helps improve the electrical energy efficiencies thereby enhancing the sustainability electrical building for main see copper efficient motors site and building orientation have some major effects hvac passive solar building design allows buildings harness the energy the sun efficiently without the use any active solar mechanisms such photovoltaic cells solar hot water panels typically passive solar building designs incorporate materials with high thermal mass that retain heat effectively and strong insulation that works prevent heat low energy designs also requires the use solar means blinds relieve the solar heat gain summer and reduce the need for artificial low energy buildings typically have very low surface area volume ratio minimize heat this means that sprawling winged building designs often thought look more organic are often avoided favor more centralized traditional cold climate buildings such american colonial saltbox designs provide good historical model for centralized heat efficiency scale windows are placed maximize the input creating light while minimizing the loss heat through poor the northern hemisphere this usually involves installing large number facing windows collect direct sun and severely restricting the number facing certain window such double triple glazed insulated windows with gas filled spaces and low emissivity coatings provide much better insulation than pane glass preventing excess solar gain means solar shading devices the summer months important reduce cooling deciduous trees are often planted front windows block excessive sun summer with their leaves but allow light through winter when their leaves fall louvers light shelves are installed allow the sunlight during the winter when the sun lower the and keep out the summer when the sun high the coniferous evergreen plants are often planted the north buildings shield against cold north colder heating systems are primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one the largest single energy drains warmer climates where cooling primary passive solar designs can also very masonry building materials with high thermal mass are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures night throughout the addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures order maximize surface area and heat citation needed buildings are often designed capture and channel existing particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby bodies water many these valuable strategies are employed some way the traditional architecture warm such western mission climates with four integrated energy system will increase when the building well when sited work with the forces nature when heat recaptured used immediately when the heat plant relying fossil fuels electricity greater than efficient and when renewable energy renewable energy generation bedzed solar panels solar active solar devices such photovoltaic solar panels help provide sustainable electricity for any electrical output solar panel dependent efficiency latitude and solar gain varies even the same typical efficiencies for commercially available panels range from the low efficiency certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period their this low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not viable energy germany for solar panels are commonly installed residential home roofs are often angled toward the sun allow photovoltaic panels collect maximum the northern south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar south not solar panels can produce adequate energy aligned within however higher winter energy yield will significantly reduced for south maximize efficiency the collector can angled above horizontal latitude maximize efficiency the angle should latitude however for annual maximum the angle the panel above horizontal should equal its wind turbines wind power the use undersized wind turbines energy production sustainable structures requires the consideration many considering small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative the amount energy they for small wind maintenance costs can deciding factor sites with marginal harnessing wind maintenance can consume much small wind wind turbines begin operating when winds reach achieve energy production capacity speeds and shut off avoid damage speeds exceeding the energy potential wind turbine proportional the square the length its blades and the cube the speed which its blades though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for single because these the efficiency the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions the building for these for wind turbines all they must installed locations that are known receive constant amount wind with average wind speeds more than rather than locations that receive wind small wind turbine can installed installation issues then include the strength the vibration and the turbulence caused the roof small scale rooftop wind turbines have been known able generate power from the electricity required regular domestic household turbines for residential scale use are usually between feet feet diameter and produce electricity rate watts watts their tested wind building integrated wind turbine performance can enhanced with the addition aerofoil wing top roof mounted design feasibility wind turbine systems solar water heating solar thermal power solar water heaters also called solar domestic hot water can effective way generate hot water for they can used any and the fuel they there are two types solar water active and active solar collector system can produce about gallons hot water per passive system will have lower there are also two types direct circulation systems and indirect circulation direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the they should not used climates with temperatures below indirect circulation loops glycol some other fluid through the solar panels and uses heat exchanger heat the domestic the two most common types collector panels are plate and the two work similarly except that evacuated tubes not convectively lose which greatly improves their efficiency more with these higher evacuated tube solar collectors can also produce temperature space and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling electric resistance water heaters that are common homes today have electrical demand around with the use solar the energy use cut the front cost installing solar collectors but with the annual energy payback periods are relatively heat pumps air source heat pumps can thought reversible air like air ashp can take heat from relatively cool space house and dump into hot place outside however unlike air the condenser and evaporator ashp can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump into warm air source heat pumps are inexpensive relative other heat pump however the efficiency source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature very cold very therefore they are only really applicable temperate for areas not located temperate ground source heat pumps provide efficient the difference between the two heat pumps that the source has one its heat exchangers placed usually horizontal vertical ground source takes advantage the relatively mild temperatures which means their efficiencies can much greater than that source heat the ground heat exchanger generally needs considerable amount designers have placed them open area next the building underneath parking energy star source heat pumps can more efficient than their source they are also quieter and can also applied other functions like domestic hot water terms initial the source heat pump system costs about twice much standard source heat pump however the front costs can more than offset the decrease energy the reduction energy costs especially apparent areas with typically hot summers and cold other types heat pumps are source and the building located near body the pond lake could used heat source air earth heat pumps circulate the air through underground with higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat air earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major sustainable building materials green building some examples sustainable building materials include recycled denim fiber glass sustainably harvested trass linoleum sheep concrete high and ultra high performance roman healing concrete panels made from paper baked rammed clay vermiculite flax sisal seegrass expanded clay coconut wood fibre calcium sand locally obtained stone and and bamboo which one the strongest and fastest growing woody plants and toxic voc glues and recycled materials sustainable architecture often incorporates the use recycled second hand such reclaimed lumber and recycled copper the reduction use new materials creates corresponding reduction embodied energy energy used the production often sustainable architects attempt retrofit old structures serve new needs order avoid unnecessary architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when when older buildings are frequently any good wood renewed and sold any good dimension stone similarly many other parts are reused such windows mantels and thus reducing the consumption new when new materials are green designers look for materials that are rapidly such bamboo which can harvested for commercial use after only years sorghum wheat both which are waste material that can pressed into cork oak which only the outer bark removed for thus preserving the when building materials may gleaned from the site for new structure being constructed wooded wood from the trees which were cut make room for the building would used part the building lower volatile organic compounds low impact building materials are used wherever for insulation may made from low voc volatile organic compound emitting materials such recycled denim cellulose insulation rather than the building insulation materials that may contain carcinogenic toxic materials such discourage insect these alternate insulation materials may treated with boric acid organic based paints may however common fallacy that green materials are always better for the health occupants the many harmful substances including arsenic and are naturally occurring and are not without their histories use with the best study emissions from materials the state california has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more traditional materials actually were lower thus the subject emissions must carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the volatile organic compounds can found any indoor environment coming from variety different vocs have high vapor pressure and low water and are suspected causing sick building syndrome type this because many vocs have been known cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic sick building indoor concentrations vocs are higher than the outdoor and when there are many vocs they can cause additive and multiplicative green products are usually considered contain fewer vocs and better for human and environmental case study conducted the department architectural and environmental engineering the university miami that compared three green products and their green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the green counterparts both emitted levels the amount and intensity the vocs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human materials sustainability standards despite the importance materials overall building quantifying and evaluating the sustainability building materials has proven there little coherence the measurement and assessment materials sustainability resulting landscape today that littered with hundreds inconsistent and often imprecise standards and certifications this discord has led both confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and the incorporation inconsistent sustainability criteria larger building certification programs such leed various proposals have been made regarding rationalization the standardization landscape for sustainable building waste management waste takes the form spent useless materials generated from households and construction and demolition and manufacturing and agricultural these materials are loosely categorized municipal solid construction and demolition debris and industrial agricultural sustainable architecture focuses the site use waste management incorporating things such grey water systems for use garden and composting toilets reduce these when combined with site food waste composting and site can reduce waste small amount

major players the shift away from modernism were trained princeton school where recourse history continued part design training the and was the increasing rise interest history had profound impact architectural history courses became more typical and with the demand for professors knowledgeable the history several phd programs schools architecture arose order differentiate themselves from art

columbia university and werner oechslin and kurt forster eth rich the term relation architecture has far been mostly considered through the lens building technology and its going beyond the technical sphere design invention and some scholars are starting position architecture within much broader cultural framework the human interrelationship with nature adopting this framework allows tracing rich history cultural debates about our relationship nature and the from the point view different historical and geographical sustainable urbanism and architecture concurrently the recent movements new
