photography convincing the new york camera club allow him put together panel photographers who would then the sole judges photography after more than year arguing with the directors the camera many whom did not have any passion for photography stieglitz gave and began looking for other late met edward steichen who had been trained painter but who had also taken steichen shared the enthusiasm and passion and soon the two were planning how change the course photography the following year they had conceived great exhibition the first judged photographers and had found venue the national arts club new and exhibition american pictorial arranged the photo secession opened critical moreover stieglitz had met his goal having show judged photographers spite the title the all accounts was the sole person responsible for selecting the the following year stieglitz further cemented his reputation the leading proponent fine art photography launching the famed journal camera work with the

allow him further promote photography medium individual while the journal give him respected forum for showcasing pictorial photography and for publishing his was not financial rather than daunted this stieglitz became even more convinced that would succeed convincing the art world the rightful place photography could only find the right platform for his the end stieglitz was difficult curtis president the american federation photography and outspoken critic organized exhibition called the first american photographic the clausen galleries new was judged jury eminent american including william merritt chase and robert henri which gave considerable standing the art stieglitz and other photographers saw direct challenge which was clearly intended stieglitz countered this move trying get some the best known photographers europe join him part united traveled london meet with some the founders the important photographic group the linked ring including crag frederick evans alvin langdon coburn and alfred horley was hoping convince them start chapter the linked ring the united which would also met with playwright george bernard shaw who was avid amateur about ways promote photography art unfortunately stieglitz took ill before any these conversations led and had return was frustrated and seeking definitive new way carry out his mission promoting photography for sake independent any other art gertrude sebier the little galleries the secession when stieglitz returned new york edward steichen was living studio apartment the top floor small building fifth between west and west steichen noticed that some rooms across from him were and soon convinced stieglitz that they would make perfect space exhibit photography and particular the works the stieglitz who was still dejected from his trip was reluctant but steichen summer stieglitz signed year lease for three small rooms that would soon become one the most famous art galleries the the two them began planning how use the new space most not only gallery but educational facility for artists and photographers and meeting place for art stieglitz sent letter all members the saying stieglitz and steichen had planned the gallery commercial saying that would negotiate sales behalf owners picture charging commission percent for the benefit the secession this premise thought have been pushed who had much better business and over the years became point contention between the two stieglitz believed that was better for exhibited work someone who appreciated for its artistic merit rather than its investment and was known have quoted wildly inconsistent prices for the same piece depending what perceived the true interest the potential november the little galleries the photo formally opened its with almost public the opening was attended mainly those members the secession who were new york the the first exhibit consisted one hundred prints secession selected entirely over the next few weeks hundreds new yorkers came the and stieglitz was once again elevated the position standard bearer artistic photographer the opening show was followed one french including robert demachy constant puyo and all whom showed prints made the gum bichromate process this was followed person show the works gertrude sebier and clarence white four more exhibitions were held including one british early prints show devoted german and austrian and another exhibition prints members the after highly successful first stieglitz and steichen felt that they had made their point about the stature fine art confident were they their success that their colleague joseph keily wrote today america the real battle for the recognition pictorial photography the chief purpose for which the secession was established has been accomplished the serious recognition photography additional medium pictorial ironically stieglitz began feel that had succeeded transforming the secession into something once disliked established set its ways and complacent its approach there was any truth this statement reflected directly back stieglitz since was known for his authoritarian control the secession and selecting what was exhibited the until now discomfort was held check more conservative but the summer steichen decided move paris order devote more his time his photography and without business eye watching over stieglitz began reclaim some his radical stieglitz decided shake things and did mounting the first photography show the gallery this notable because signaled the beginning role pioneer promoter modern art the drawings artist pamela coleman initially attracted little but after prominent critic praised the work became the best attended exhibition substantial number the works were and interest the show was strong that had extended eight stieglitz began planning for future photography but for the remainder the walls were filled with exhibits such photographers adolf meyer alvin langdon coburn and once members the the steichen had become friends with the famous sculptor auguste rodin and convinced rodin lend him some his drawings for show the gallery new the gallery season started with the show drawings auguste the first exhibit the united states his works the show caused significant amount controversy the with one critic saying they are not the sort thing offer public view even soon after that show ended stieglitz was notified that the landlord wanted double the rent and would require year that time the secession group had only small more than per spite minor the original plan that membership fees and commissions would support the gallery had not been although appealed those members that the economy was significant downturn and offers assistance since there was other source stieglitz sadly went about closing the april that year the original gallery space had been was immediately taken over tailor born stieglitz thought that his gallery was but unknown him recent acquaintance named paul haviland emerged from studies learned about the closure the and used some his wealth sign year lease for small space directly across the hall from the old after some convincing haviland that the new space was stieglitz gathered some other friends and came with additional funds for supplies printing and the new gallery which measured only fifteen feet was actually located the next building the block fifth the wall between the two buildings had been removed during previous however all appearances the new gallery seemed share the same address the old perhaps save money printing and perhaps because his affection for the old stieglitz wanted the new address remain both haviland and however agreed that the previous name little galleries the was longer they wanted the new space about more than later stieglitz would write are not with not with much with the secession not much school following attitude towards and its motto seems give every man who claims have message for the world chance being from thenceforth stieglitz referred the gallery without the street name other descriptive however some the original members the secession did not appreciate the name change and especially the thinking that led stieglitz old friends gertrude sebier and clarence white saw the last straw series autocratic moves and soon series increasingly bitter arguments broke out among the three one point stieglitz wrote jealousies soon became rampant among photographers around exact repetition the situation rebelled against the camera various secessionists were danger harming not only each other but what was attempting build and too that the very commercialism and seeking most opposed were actually favored certain these differences opinion were increase over the next two exacerbated part stubbornness and his refusal include many his time photographer friends decisions about the direction the new meanwhile steichen returned the february with new group photos for show held the galley the following more brought with him group prints lent him henri who that time little known outside stieglitz promptly assembled the prints for show the new was the first show any work matisse the united states and the first man show for the artist outside and marked the turning point the focus the after this was known much less for photography and much more leading force for modern art moreover stieglitz continued make sure that the gallery was not just exhibition strongly believed its original mission being educational facility and meeting place for those with garde describing the matisse wrote here was the work new with new ideas very the exhibition led many heated proved constantin the forefront modern art new york addition marking the beginning new path for was significant for stieglitz due the death his father the two had not been particularly but his stieglitz father left him the then substantial amount stieglitz drew this amount over the next several years help keep the new art and the reactions were very vitalizing gave him brand new set admirers and followers time when was feeling less and less connected his old colleagues the from then the course the gallery was from until closed featured only six shows photography out total exhibitions the change the focus the gallery led coalescence group intellectuals and artists who both sympathized with aims and who themselves were invigorated the atmosphere after the artistic success the matisse the gallery took new any given stieglitz might have been surrounded artists john marin max weber arthur dove marsden hartley marius zayas authors and art critics sadakichi hartmann and benjamin casseres financial supporters paul haviland and agnes ernst and editors and collaborators joseph keiley and john zayas had both passion and vision that matched with and soon was helping define what the aesthetics this new generation art would his work was exhibited the wrote several articles for camera work and introduced stieglitz some the newest european artists serving guide and interpreter when stieglitz would travel his interest african tribal art and admiration for cubist work convinced stieglitz hold groundbreaking exhibitions these subjects for historical virtually other galleries the united states were showing works with such abstract and dynamic content that whether was already controversial european artists like matisse relatively unknown but famous americans like weber dove stieglitz had both the aesthetic sense and the nerve showcase individuals who are now acknowledged have been the forefront modern the more artist confounded the public the more stieglitz felt justified his when presented first exhibit this country stieglitz delighted telling critics that the works they called the gibberings found perfect bach among the significant exhibitions that took place during this period were first shows for alfred maurer john marin and marsden hartley second shows rodin and and important shows for newer artists arthur carles arthur dove and max weber elie nadelman camera work later years starting stieglitz began express increasing amount frustration over the changes that were happening the world that wrote much the enthusiasm that had existed gradually disappeared because the coming close friends seemed fall the stieglitz was especially troubled because his parents came from and still had many close friends while did not sympathize with the german war could not see germany all wrong and the allies all the same because the depressed economy attendance the gallery sharply declined and subscriptions camera work dropped make matters even the small corps volunteer workers the galley all but disappeared people joined the armed forces had take other jobs help make ends once again was haviland who came the early told stieglitz that was and something bold was needed bring back assembled close circle relatively off including agnes meyer and dorothy and together with stieglitz they came with the idea publishing new they decided that this time would not only magazine about art but work art printed limited edition with very high quality paper and the new which they all agreed should called appeared critical twelve issues were printed over the next fourteen showcasing some the most garde art and design the unfortunately the magazine did little revive the status the stieglitz continued present some outstanding but the overall effect the mounting war tension the economy could not event happened that further sealed the fate the stieglitz met
