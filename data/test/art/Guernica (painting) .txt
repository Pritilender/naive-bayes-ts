relationship kind ballet that was conceived variety ways throughout when pressed explain them guernica picasso this bull bull and this horse you give meaning certain things paintings may very but not idea give this what ideas and conclusions you have got obtained but unconsciously make the painting for the paint the objects for what they the dream and lie franco series narrative sketches also created for the franco depicted monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with angry work these illustrations began before the bombing and four additional panels were three which relate directly the guernica picasso said worked the the spanish struggle the fight reaction against the against whole life artist has been nothing more than continuous struggle against reaction and the death how could anybody think for moment that could agreement with reaction and the panel which which shall call guernica and all recent works clearly express abhorrence the military caste which has sunk spain ocean pain and however according scholar beverly ray the following list interpretations reflects the general consensus the shape and posture the bodies express picasso uses white and grey paint set somber mood and express pain and flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction but reflect the destructive power civil the newspaper print used the painting reflects how picasso learned the the light bulb the painting represents the the broken sword near the bottom the painting symbolizes the defeat the people the hand their berger chipp drawing attention

painting referential composition the tradition atelier paintings such las meninas diego zquez his chef oeuvre picasso seems trying define his role and his power artist the face political power and but far from being mere political guernica should seen comment what art can actually contribute towards the assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such political war and historical context spanish civil war spanish civil guernica town the province biscay basque during the spanish civil was regarded the northern bastion the republican resistance movement and the epicenter basque adding its significance the republican forces were made assorted factions socialists anarchists name with wildly differing approaches government and eventual but common opposition the the led general francisco were also factionalized but lesser they sought return the golden days based order and traditional catholic family about april warplanes the german condor legion commanded colonel wolfram von richthofen bombed guernica for about two germany this time led had lent material support the nationalists and allowed for the evolution german fighter and bomber later intense aerial bombardment became crucial preliminary step the blitzkrieg tactic his journal for april von richthofen when the first junkers squadron there was smoke already
