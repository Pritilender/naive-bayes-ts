deemed somewhat deficient and lacking truth photography produced lifelike images much more efficiently and spite photography actually inspired artists pursue other means artistic and rather than compete with photography emulate artists focused the one thing they could inevitably better than the further developing into art form its very subjectivity the conception the the very subjectivity that photography the impressionists sought express their perceptions rather than create exact this allowed artists depict subjectively what they saw with their tacit imperatives taste and photography encouraged painters exploit aspects the painting like which photography then the impressionists were the first consciously offer subjective alternative the claude monet jardin sainte metropolitan
