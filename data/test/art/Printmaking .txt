raison probante the cogent woodcut old master print printmaking the process making artworks printing normally paper printmaking normally covers only the process creating prints that have element rather than just being photographic reproduction except the case monotyping the process capable producing multiples same which called print each print produced not considered copy but rather considered original this because typically each print varies extent due variables intrinsic the printmaking and also because the imagery print typically not simply reproduction another work but rather often unique image designed from the start expressed particular printmaking print may known impression printmaking other than not chosen only for its ability produce multiple but rather for the unique qualities that each the printmaking processes lends itself prints are created transferring ink from matrix through prepared screen sheet paper other common types matrices metal usually copper polymer plates for engraving etching stone aluminum polymer for lithography blocks wood for woodcuts and wood engravings and linoleum for linocuts screens made silk synthetic fabrics are used for the screenprinting process other types matrix substrates and related processes are discussed multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form edition since the late artists have generally signed individual impressions from edition and often number the impressions form limited edition the matrix then destroyed that more prints can prints may also printed book such illustrated books artist

registration protective printmaking equipment see also printmakers nationality notes references further reading external links techniques printmaking woodcuts and engravings smarthistory overview printmaking techniques are generally divided into the following basic relief where ink applied the original surface the relief techniques include woodcut woodblock the asian forms are usually wood engraving linocut and metalcut intaglio where ink applied beneath the original surface the intaglio techniques include engraving etching mezzotint aquatint planographic where the matrix retains its original but specially prepared inked allow for the transfer the planographic techniques include lithography monotyping and digital stencil where ink paint pressed through prepared including screenprinting and pochoir other types printmaking techniques outside these groups include collagraphy viscosity printing and foil imaging collagraphy printmaking technique which textured material adhered the printing this texture transferred the paper during the printing contemporary printmaking may include digital printing photographic combination photographic and traditional many these techniques can also especially within the same for example prints are usually referred etchings for but very often include work engraving and drypoint and sometimes have etching woodcut woodcut

print the earliest printmaking and the only one traditionally used the far was probably first developed means printing patterns and the century was used china for printing text and images woodcuts images paper developed around and slightly later these are the two areas where woodcut has been most extensively used purely process for making images without the artist draws design plank wood paper which transferred the traditionally the artist then handed the work specialist who then uses sharp tools carve away the parts the block that will not receive the surface the block then inked with the use brayer and then sheet paper perhaps slightly placed over the the block then rubbed with baren spoon run through printing press separate blocks can used for each color technique called reduction printing can reduction printing name used describe the process using one block print several layers color one this usually involves cutting small amount the block and then printing the block many times over different sheets before washing the cutting more away and printing the next color this allows the previous color show this process can repeated many times the advantages this process that only one block and that different components intricate design will line the disadvantage that once the artist moves the next more prints can another variation woodcut printmaking the cukil made famous the taring padi underground community indonesia taring padi posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded with political images usually resembling visually complex are carved unto wooden surface called then smothered with ink before pressing unto media such paper engraving engraving melencolia albrecht rer the process was developed germany the from the engraving used goldsmiths decorate engravers use hardened steel tool called burin cut the design into the surface metal traditionally made engraving using burin generally difficult skill gravers come variety shapes and sizes that yield different line the burin produces unique and recognizable quality line that characterized its deliberate appearance and clean other tools such mezzotint roulettes tool with toothed and burnishers tool used for making object smooth shiny are used for texturing make the engraved plate inked all then the ink wiped off the leaving only ink the engraved the plate then put through pressure printing press together with sheet paper often moistened soften the paper picks the ink from the engraved making the process can repeated many typically several hundred impressions could printed before the printing plate shows much sign except when drypoint which gives much shallower the true engraving was revived serious art form artists including stanley william hayter whose studio paris and new york city became the magnet for such artists pablo picasso alberto giacometti mauricio lasansky and joan etching francisco goya etching etching part the intaglio family along with engraving drypoint mezzotint and aquatint the process believed have been invented daniel hopfer circa germany who decorated armor this and applied the method etching soon came challenge engraving the most popular printmaking its great advantage was unlike engraving which requires special skill etching relatively easy learn for artist trained etching rembrandt etching prints are generally linear and often contain fine detail and lines can vary from smooth etching opposite woodcut that the raised portions etching remain blank while the crevices hold pure metal usually zinc plate covered with waxy acrylic the artist then draws through the ground with pointed etching the exposed metal lines are then etched dipping the plate bath etchant nitric acid ferric chloride the etchant bites into the exposed leaving behind lines the the remaining ground then cleaned off the and the printing process then just the same for artists using this technique include albrecht rer rembrandt francisco goya whistler otto dix james ensor edward hopper the kollwitz pablo picasso twombly lucas van leyden carlos alvarado lang mezzotint mezzotint intaglio variant engraving which the image formed from subtle gradations light and mezzotint from the italian mezzo half and tinta tone dark form which requires artists work from dark create the surface copper printing plate roughened evenly all over with the aid tool known the image then formed smoothing the surface with tool known when the roughened areas the plate will hold more ink and print more while smoother areas the plate hold less and will print more lightly not however possible create the image only roughening the plate working from light mezzotint known for the luxurious quality its first because finely roughened surface holds lot allowing deep solid colors secondly because the process smoothing the texture with burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations tone the mezzotint printmaking method was invented ludwig von siegen the process was used widely england from the eighteenth reproduce oil paintings and aquatint aquatint technique used intaglio etchings like aquatint technique involves the application acid make marks metal where the etching technique uses needle make lines that retain aquatint relies powdered rosin which acid resistant the ground create tonal the rosin applied light dusting fan the rosin then cooked until set the this time the rosin can burnished scratched out affect its tonal the tonal variation controlled the level acid exposure over large and thus the image shaped large sections goya used aquatint for most his drypoint drypoint variant done with sharp rather than shaped burin while engraved lines are very smooth and drypoint scratching leaves rough burr the edges each this burr gives drypoint prints characteristically and sometimes line because the pressure printing quickly destroys the drypoint useful only for very small few ten twenty counter and allow for longer print electro plating here called has been used since the nineteenth century harden the surface the technique appears have been invented the housebook master south german century all whose prints are drypoint among the most famous artists the old master albrecht rer produced drypoints before abandoning the rembrandt used but usually conjunction with etching and lithography lithography daumier vincent van gogh george bellows pierre bonnard edvard munch emil nolde pablo picasso odilon redon henri lautrec salvador escher willem kooning joan stow wengenroth goulue lautrec lithography technique invented alois senefelder and based the chemical repulsion oil and water porous surface normally limestone the image drawn the limestone with greasy acid transferring the grease the leaving the image into the gum arabic water soluble then sealing the surface the stone not covered with the drawing the stone with water staying only the surface not covered based residue the the stone then rolled meaning oil ink applied with roller covering the entire since water repels the oil the the ink adheres only the greasy perfectly inking the sheet dry paper placed the and the image transferred the paper the pressure the printing lithography known for its ability capture fine gradations shading and very small variant photo lithography which the image captured photographic processes metal printing carried out the same screenprinting screenprinting josef albers ralston crawford gene davis robert indiana roy lichtenstein julian opie bridget riley edward ruscha andy warhol and carlos alvarado lang screenprinting occasionally known silkscreen serigraphy creates prints using fabric stencil ink simply pushed through the stencil against the surface the most often with the aid generally the technique uses natural synthetic fabric stretched tightly across rectangular much like stretched the fabric can nylon multifilament even stainless steel while commercial screenprinting often requires mechanical apparatuses and calibrated printmakers value for the approach and the low technical high quality the essential tools required are mesh and unlike many other printmaking printing press not screenprinting essentially stencil screenprinting may adapted printing variety from cloth and canvas glass and artists have used the technique print slabs directly onto and reproduce images textiles which would distort under pressure from printing monotype monotyping monotyping type printmaking made drawing painting non absorbent the was historically copper etching but contemporary work can vary from zinc glass acrylic the image then transferred onto sheet paper pressing the two usually using monotypes can also created inking entire surface and using brushes removing ink create subtractive creating lights from field opaque the inks used may oil based water with oil based the paper may which case the image has more the paper may which case the image has percent greater range unlike monoprinting monotyping produces unique because most the ink removed during the initial although subsequent reprintings are sometimes they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered second print from the original plate called ghost cognate stencils watercolor solvents brushes and other tools are often used embellish monotype monotypes are often spontaneously executed and with preliminary monotypes are the most painterly method among the printmaking unique print that essentially printed the principal characteristic this medium found its spontaneity and its combination painting and drawing monoprint monoprinting monoprinting form printmaking that uses matrix such litho copper but produces impressions that are multiple unique impressions printed from single matrix are sometimes known variable there are many techniques used including collagraph collage hand painted and form tracing which thick ink laid down paper placed the and the back the paper drawn transferring the ink the monoprints can also made altering the color and viscosity the ink used create different traditional printmaking such woodcut and can used make digital prints digital printing istvan horkay ralph goings enrique chagoya digital prints refers images printed using digital printer instead traditional printing these images can printed variety substrates including cloth plastic accurate color reproduction and the type ink used see are key distinguishing high quality from low quality digital metallics golds are particularly difficult reproduce accurately because they reflect light back digital high quality digital prints typically are reproduced with very resolution data files with very precision the substrate used has effect the final colors and cannot ignored when selecting color pigment based based inks unlike dyes dissolve when mixed into dyes are organic not mineral although most are derived from petroleum they can made from vegetable animal dyes are well suited for textiles where the liquid dye penetrates and chemically bonds the because the deep more layers material must lose their color before the fading dyes however are not suitable for the relatively thin layers ink laid out the surface pigment finely particulate substance when mixed ground into liquid make ink does not but remains dispersed suspended the pigments are categorized either inorganic organic such red iron oxide simply oxidized form iron one could leave lead gold the sun for million years and they would never change color change into another dubious discuss man made synthetic and vegetable soluble dyes can fade often within one six gicl gicl zhee klay neologism coined printmaker jack duganne for digital prints made inkjet based the french word which means nozzle today fine art prints produced jet machines using the ccmmyk color model are generally called foil imaging foil imaging printmaking technique made using the iowa foil developed virginia myers from the commercial foil stamping process this uses gold leaf and acrylic foil the printmaking color hiroshige great sudden shower atake van gogh the bridge the printmakers apply color their prints many different some coloring techniques include positive surface negative surface and often color printmaking that involves screenprinting woodcut linocut applied either using separate blocks screens using reductionist multiple plate color number screens blocks are each providing different each separate screen block will inked different color and applied particular sequence produce the entire average about plates are but there are occasions where printmaker may use seven every application another plate color will interact with the color already applied the and this must kept mind when producing the separation the lightest colors are often applied and then darker colors successively until the the reductionist approach producing color start with lino wood block that either blank with simple upon each printing color the printmaker will then further cut into the lino woodblock removing more material and then apply another color and each successive removal lino wood from the block will expose the already printed color the viewer the picasso often cited the inventor reduction although there evidence this method use years before the subtractive color concept also used offset digital print and present bitmap vectorial software cmyk other color registration printmaking processes requiring more than one application ink other the problem exists how line properly areas image receive ink each the most obvious example this would color image which each color applied separate the lining the results each step multistep printmaking process called proper registration results the various components image being their proper but for artistic improper registration not necessarily the ruination this can vary considerably from process generally involves placing the generally correct
