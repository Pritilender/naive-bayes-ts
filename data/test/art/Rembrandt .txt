critical work the middle his from which his final etching style began although the print only survives two states the first very evidence much reworking can seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements the mature works the rembrandt was more ready improvise the plate and large prints typically survive several often radically now uses hatching create his dark which often take much the also experimented with the effects printing different kinds including japanese which used and vellum began use surface leaving thin film ink parts the plate instead wiping completely clean print each made more use drypoint exploiting especially the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives the first few his prints have similar subjects his although the seven portraits are relatively more and portraits other people less there are six mostly which largely set the course for the graphic treatment landscape until the end the one third his etchings are religious many treated with homely whilst others are his most monumental few just compositions have equivalent his until forced sell magnificent collection prints other and many borrowings and influences his work

now generally and the frick itself never changed its own the label still reading rembrandt and not attributed school more recent opinion has shifted even more decisively favor the with simon schama his book rembrandt eyes and the rembrandt project scholar ernst van wetering melbourne both arguing for attribution the those few scholars who still question authorship feel that the execution and

factor the difficulty since like many masters before encouraged his students copy his sometimes finishing retouching them sold and sometimes selling them authorized additionally his style proved easy enough for his most talented students further complicating matters the uneven quality some own and his frequent stylistic evolutions and there were later imitations his and restorations which seriously damaged the original works that they are longer highly likely that there will never universal agreement what does and what does not constitute genuine name and signature slaughtered louvre rembrandt modification the spelling the first name that introduced roughly his earliest signatures consisted the monogram for rembrant the son and starting rhl the stood presumably for used this monogram early the then added his patronymic rhl van rijn clarification needed but replaced this form that same year and began using his first name alone with its original rembrant and maintained this form consistently from then proving that this minor change had meaning for him whatever might have this change purely does not change the way his name curiously despite the large number paintings and etchings signed with this modified first most their documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original rembrant spelling the rough chronology signature forms above applies the and
