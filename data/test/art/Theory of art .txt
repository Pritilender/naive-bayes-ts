theory art institutional theory art navigation search theory art art theory the broadest theory art aims shed light some aspect the project defining art theorize about the structure our concept without providing classical namely definitions formulated terms necessary and conditions contents aesthetic response formalism institutional historical anti essentialist aesthetic creation references aesthetic response aesthetic response functional theories art many ways the most intuitive theories its the term refers type phenomenal experience and aesthetic definitions identify artworks with artifacts intended produce aesthetic nature can beautiful and can produce aesthetic but nature does not possess the function producing those for such intention and thus agency the monroe beardsley commonly associated with aesthetic definitions something art just case either arrangement conditions intended capable affording experience with marked aesthetic character arrangement belonging class type arrangements that typically intended have this painters arrange the canvas and dancers arrange the their bodily for according first art has intended aesthetic but not all artworks succeed producing aesthetic experiences the second disjunct allows for artworks that were intended have this but failed bad marcel fountain the paradigmatic counterexample aesthetic definitions apparently duchamp bought ordinary urinal from plumbing supply and smuggled into art since duchamp often stated that fountain had aesthetic any aesthetic experiences the audience may having are not attributed such works are said counterexamples because they are artworks that possess intended aesthetic beardsley replies that either such works are not art they are comments classify them fountain and the artworks just because they make comments art would classify lot dull and sometimes unintelligible magazine articles and newspaper reviews this response has been widely considered inadequate either begging relies arbitrary distinction between artworks and commentaries great many art theorists today consider aesthetic definitions art extensionally primarily because artworks the style duchamp citation needed formalism the formalist theory art asserts that should focus only the formal properties the form not the content those formal properties might for the visual color shape and and for the musical rhythm and formalists not deny that works art might have representation they deny that those things are relevant our appreciation understanding institutional the institutional theory art

atmosphere artistic knowledge the history according robert yanal danto which coined the term artworld outlined the first institutional theory versions the institutional theory were formulated more explicitly george dickie his article defining american philosophical quarterly and his books aesthetics introduction and art and the institutional analysis early version institutional theory can summed the following definition work art from aesthetics introduction work art the classificatory sense artifact upon which some person persons acting behalf certain social institution the has conferred the status candidate for dickie has reformulated his theory several books and other philosophers art have criticized his definitions being historical historical theories art hold that for something must bear some relation existing works the correct extension time the includes all the works time and additionally any works created the elapsed order for these additional works they must bear similarity relation those previously established such definition appears beg the question where this inherited status and that why historical definitions art must also include disjunct for first something art possesses historical relation previous artworks first the philosopher primarily associated with the historical definition art jerrold levinson for work art thing intended for regard any the ways works art existing prior have been correctly levinson further clarifies that intends appropriates conceives for the purpose some these manners for regard around the present are regarded with full regarded regarded with special notice regarded with emotional object intended for regard any the established then anti essentialist some art theorists have proposed that the attempt define art must abandoned and have instead urged anti essentialist theory art the role theory morris weitz famously argues that individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions will never forthcoming for the concept because open weitz describes open concepts those whose conditions application are emendable and the case borderline cases art and prima facie counterexamples open concepts call for some sort decision our part extend the use the concept cover close the concept and invent new one deal with the new case and its new ital the question whether new artifact art not but rather decision where the verdict turns whether not enlarge our set conditions for applying the for the very adventurous character its present changes and novel which makes the concept impossible capture classical definition some static univocal while essentialism was never formally was challenged and the debate over essentialist theories was subsequently swept away seemingly better essentialist commenting after berys gaut revived essentialism the philosophy art with his paper cluster cluster concepts are composed criteria that contribute art status but are not individually necessary for art there one artworks are created and being artifact necessary property for being gaut offers set ten criteria that contribute art satisfying all ten criteria would sufficient for might any subset formed nine criteria this consequence the fact that none the ten properties for consider two possessing aesthetic and being expressive neither these criteria necessary for art but both are parts subsets these ten criteria that are sufficient for art gaut definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria sufficient for art which leads highly pluralistic theory aesthetic creation zangwill describes the aesthetic creation theory art theory how art comes and theory zangwill distinguishes three phases the production work the creation the insight plays causal role bringing about actions sufficient for realizing particular aesthetic zangwill describe this relation but only says because this insight that the aesthetic properties are aesthetic properties are instantiated nonaesthetic properties which include physical such shape and and secondary such colours zangwill says that aesthetic properties supervene the nonaesthetic because the particular nonaesthetic properties has that the work possesses certain aesthetic properties and not the other way
