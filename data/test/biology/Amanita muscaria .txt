milk kill the century flemish botanist carolus clusius traced the practice sprinkling into milk frankfurt while carl linnaeus the father reported from land southern where had lived described volume two his species plantarum giving the name agaricus muscarius the specific epithet deriving from latin musca meaning fly gained its current name when placed the genus amanita jean baptiste lamarck name sanctioned the father swedish naturalist elias magnus fries the starting date for all the mycota had been set general agreement january the date and the full name was then amanita muscaria hook the

alternate name for the french mycologist pierre bulliard reported having tried without success replicate its killing properties his work histoire des plantes neuses suspectes france and proposed new binomial name agaricus aurantiacus because one compound isolated from the fungus which attracts has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating

group also have bulbous amanita section amanita consists muscaria and its close including pantherina the panther gemmata farinosa and xanthocephala modern fungal taxonomists have classified amanita muscaria and its allies this way based gross morphology and spore two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification amanita muscaria varies considerably its and many authorities recognise several subspecies varieties within the the agaricales modern taxonomy german mycologist rolf singer listed three though without muscaria ssp muscaria muscaria ssp americana and muscaria ssp flavivolvata contemporary authorities recognise seven var muscaria the typical white spotted some such rodham only use this name for eurasian and western alaskan populations var flavivolvata with yellow white found from southern alaska down through the rocky mountains through central america all the way andean colombia rodham tulloss uses this name describe all typical muscaria from indigenous new world var alba uncommon has white silvery white cap that has white warts but similar the usual form var formosa has yellow yellow cap with yellowish warts and stem which may some authorities jenkins use the name for all muscaria which fit this description others tulloss restrict its use eurasian amanita muscaria guessowii guessowii has yellow orange with the centre more orange perhaps even reddish found most commonly northeastern north from newfoundland and quebec south all the way the state tennessee some authorities jenkins treat these populations muscaria var formosa while others tulloss recognise them distinct var persicina pinkish sometimes called melon with poorly times absent remnants universal veil the stem and vassal known from the southeastern coastal areas the united and was described recent dna sequencing suggests this may separate species which may require var regalis from scandinavia and alaska brown and has yellow appears and some authorities tulloss treat separate while others jenkins treat variety the muscaria molecular phylogenetic study different regional populations muscaria mycologist zsef geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species roughly eurasian eurasian subalpine and north american specimens belonging all three clades have been found this has led the hypothesis that this was the centre diversification for this the study also looked four named varieties the var alba var flavivolvata var formosa including guessowii and regalis from both all four varieties were found within both the eurasian and north american evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies further molecular study geml and colleagues published show that these three genetic plus fourth associated with pine forest the southeastern united states and two more santa cruz island are delineated from each other enough genetically considered separate thus muscaria stands currently evidently species complex the complex also includes least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded breckonii capped mushroom associated with conifers from the pacific and

and season which can further confuse the spring and summer mushrooms have been reported contain times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fatal dose has been calculated caps deaths from this fungus muscaria have been reported historical journal articles and newspaper but with modern medical fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom extremely many older books list amanita muscaria deadly but this error that implies the mushroom more toxic than the north american mycological association has stated there were reliably documented fatalities from eating this mushroom during the the vast majority mushroom poisoning deaths are from eating the greenish yellowish death phalloides perhaps even one the several white amanita species which are known destroying angels the active

lithuania amanita muscaria has been consumed wedding feasts which mushrooms were mixed with vodka the professor also reported that the lithuanians used export muscaria the lapps the far north for use shamanic rituals the lithuanian festivities are the only report that wasson received ingestion fly agaric for religious use eastern siberia amanita muscaria was widely used entheogen many the indigenous peoples siberia its use was known among almost all the uralic speaking peoples western siberia and the paleosiberian speaking peoples the russian far east there are only isolated reports muscaria use among the tungusic and turkic peoples central siberia and believed that the whole entheogenic use muscaria was not practised these western the use muscaria was restricted who used alternative method achieving trance state siberian shamans achieve trance prolonged drumming and eastern muscaria was used both shamans and laypeople and was used recreationally well eastern the shaman would take the and others would drink his this still containing psychoactive may more potent than the muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such sweating and suggesting that the

the koryaks one report said that the poor would consume the urine the who could afford buy the other reports entheogenic use the finnish historian itkonen mentions that muscaria was once used among the sami people sorcerers inari would consume fly agarics with seven said gholam mochtar and hartmut geerken published article which they claim have discovered tradition medicinal and recreational use this mushroom among parachi speaking group afghanistan there are also unconfirmed reports religious use muscaria among two subarctic native american tribes ojibwa ethnobotanist keewaydinoquay peschel reported its use among her where was known the miskwedo this information was enthusiastically received although evidence from other sources was there also one account american who claims have been initiated into traditional tlicho use amanita muscaria soma botanical identity haoma gordon wasson proposed that muscaria was the soma talked about the rig veda claim which received widespread publicity and popular support the noted that descriptions soma omitted any description stems which suggested and used the adjective dazzling flaming which the author interprets meaning one line described men urinating soma this recalled the practice recycling urine soma mentioned coming from the which wasson interpreted the mushroom having being brought with the aryan invaders from the

rejected theory and noted that the language was too vague determine description his survey hallucinogens and culture anthropologist peter furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification the fly agaric mushroom the vedic concluding cautiously its vikings the notion that vikings used muscaria produce their berserker rages was first suggested the swedish professor samuel

archeologist and dead sea scrolls scholar john marco allegro postulated that early christian theology was derived from fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption muscaria his book the sacred mushroom and the cross but his theory has found little support scholars outside the field ethnomycology the book was roundly discredited academics and including sir godfrey driver emeritus professor semitic philology oxford university and henry chadwick the dean christ oxford christian author john king wrote detailed rebuttal theory the book christian view the mushroom notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found the middle east even though cedars and pines are found and highlights the tenuous nature the links between biblical and sumerian names coined
