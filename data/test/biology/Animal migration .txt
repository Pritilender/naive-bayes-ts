overview christmas island red crab migration can take very different forms different and such there simple accepted definition one the most commonly used proposed kennedy migratory behavior persistent and straightened out movement effected the own locomotory exertions its active embarkation upon depends some temporary inhibition station keeping responses but promotes their eventual disinhibition and migration encompasses four related persistent straight relocation individual greater scale both spatially and than its normal daily seasonal movement population between two and movement leading the redistribution individuals within migration can either obligate meaning individuals must facultative meaning individuals can choose migrate within migratory species even within single often not all individuals complete migration when all individuals partial migration when some individuals migrate while others and differential migration when the difference between migratory and migratory individuals based age sex for while most migratory movements occur annual some daily movements are also referred many aquatic animals make diel vertical migration travelling few hundred metres and down the water while some jellyfish make daily horizontal traveling few hundred metres across irregular migrations such irruptions can occur under pressure overpopulation some more obscure specific groups starlings different kinds animal migrate different birds bird migration roughly the bird species migrate long distances each year response the many these migrations are with species feeding and breeding high northern latitudes the and moving some hundreds kilometres south for the some species extend this strategy migrate annually between the northern and southern the arctic tern famous for its flies from its arctic breeding grounds the antarctic and back again each distance least giving two summers every fish fish migration salmon spawn most fish species are relatively limited their remaining single geographical area and making short migrations for few hundred species migrate long some cases thousands about species including several species salmon migrate between saltwater and freshwater they are forage fish such herring and capelin migrate around substantial parts the north atlantic ocean the capelin for example spawn around the southern and western coasts their larvae drift clockwise around while the fish swim northwards towards jan mayen island and return iceland parallel with east the sardine run billions southern african pilchard sardinops sagax spawn the cool waters the agulhas bank and move northward along the east coast south africa between may and insects insect migration lepidoptera migration pantala flavescens coorg some winged insects such locusts and certain butterflies and dragonflies with strong flight migrate long among the species libellula and sympetrum are known for mass while pantala flavescens known the globe skimmer wandering glider makes the longest ocean crossing any between india and some migratory butterflies such the monarch and the painted lady individual completes the whole instead the butterflies mate and reproduce the and successive generations travel the next stage the other animals wildebeest serengeti great mass migration occurs mammals such the serengeti great annual circular pattern movement with some million wildebeest and hundreds thousands other large game animals including gazelles and zebra migration important other mammals including cetaceans the dolphins and long distance migrations occur some notably the mass migration the mexican tailed bat between oregon and southern some reptiles and amphibians some crustaceans most spectacularly the christmas island red crab which moves masse each year the tracking migration monarch animal migration tracking scientists gather observations animal migration tracking their animals were traditionally tracked with identification tags such bird rings for later information was obtained about the actual route followed between release and and only small fraction tagged individuals were generally more therefore are electronic devices such radio tracking collars which can followed whether vehicle tags can include gps receiver enabling accurate positions broadcast regular but these are inevitably heavier and more expensive than devices without alternative the argos doppler also called platform transmitter which sends regularly the orbiting argos using doppler shift the location can relatively roughly compared but lower cost and radio tracking tags can fitted insects including dragonflies and bees culture before the phenomenon animal migration was various folklore and erroneous explanations sprang account for the disappearance sudden arrival birds ancient greece aristotle proposed that robins turned into redstarts when summer the barnacle goose was explained european medieval bestiaries and manuscripts either growing like fruit developing from goose barnacles pieces another example the which was once even naturalists such gilbert white hibernate either buried muddy hollow see also animal navigation human migration
