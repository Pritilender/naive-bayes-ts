biology	archaea navigation search archean archaeidae paleoarchean perhaps eoarchean recent archean proterozoic halobacteria scientific classification archaea woese kandler wheelis crenarchaeota euryarchaeota korarchaeota nanoarchaeota thaumarchaeota the archaea singular archaeon are domain kingdom single celled microorganisms these microbes are prokaryotes meaning they have cell nucleus any other bound organelles their archaea were initially classified bacteria receiving the name archaebacteria kingdom monera but this classification archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains bacteria and eukaryota the archaea are further divided into four recognized phyla classification difficult because the majority have not been studied the laboratory and have only been detected analysis their nucleic acids samples from their archaea and bacteria are similar size and although few archaea have very strange such the flat and shaped cells haloquadratum walsbyi despite this visual similarity archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related those notably the enzymes involved transcription and translation other aspects archaeal biochemistry are such their reliance ether lipids their cell membranes archaea use more energy sources than these range from organic compounds such ammonia metal ions even hydrogen gas salt tolerant archaea the haloarchaea use sunlight energy and other species archaea fix carbon however unlike plants and cyanobacteria species archaea does archaea reproduce asexually binary fission fragmentation budding unlike bacteria and species form spores archaea were initially viewed extremophiles living harsh such hot springs and salt lakes but they have since been found broad range habitats including oceans marshlands and the human colon and navel archaea are particularly numerous the and the archaea plankton may one the most abundant groups organisms the archaea are major part life and may play roles both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle clear examples archaeal pathogens parasites are but they are often mutualists commensals one example the methanogens that inhabit the human gut and the ruminant gut where their vast numbers aid digestion methanogens are used biogas production and sewage treatment and enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents are exploited biotechnology contents classification new domain current classification species origin and evolution comparison other domains relationship other prokaryotes relation eukaryotes morphology structure composition operation membranes wall and flagella metabolism genetics gene transfer and genetic exchange reproduction ecology habitats role chemical cycling interactions with other organisms mutualism commensalism significance technology and industry see also references further reading external links classification new domain for much the prokaryotes were regarded single group organisms and classified based their biochemistry morphology and metabolism for microbiologists tried classify microorganisms based the structures their cell walls their and the substances they however new approach was proposed linus pauling and emile using the sequences the genes these organisms work out how different prokaryotes are related each this known phylogenetics the main method used hot springs grand prismatic spring yellowstone national park archaea were first classified separate group prokaryotes carl woese and george fox phylogenetic trees based the sequences ribosomal rna genes these two groups were originally named the archaebacteria and eubacteria and treated kingdoms which woese and fox termed urkingdoms woese argued that this group prokaryotes fundamentally different sort emphasize this woese later proposed new natural system organisms with three separate domains the eukarya the bacteria and the archaea what now known the woesian the word archaea comes from the ancient greek meaning ancient the first representatives the domain archaea were methanogens and was assumed that their metabolism reflected primitive atmosphere and the for long archaea were seen extremophiles that only exist extreme habitats such hot springs and salt lakes however new habitats were studied more organisms were extreme halophilic and hyperthermophilic microbes were also included the the end the archaea had been identified extreme environments today they are known large and diverse group organisms that are widely distributed nature and are common all this new appreciation the importance and ubiquity archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction detect prokaryotes from environmental samples such water multiplying their ribosomal this allows the detection and identification organisms that have not been cultured the current classification biological classification systematics the classification and prokaryotes rapidly moving and contentious current classification systems aim organize archaea into groups organisms that share structural features and common these classifications rely heavily the use the sequence ribosomal rna genes reveal relationships between organisms molecular phylogenetics most the culturable and investigated species archaea are members two main phyla the euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota other groups have been tentatively for the peculiar species nanoarchaeum equitans which was discovered has been given its own the nanoarchaeota new phylum korarchaeota has also been contains small group unusual thermophilic species that shares features both the main but most closely related the other recently detected species archaea are only distantly related any these such the archaeal richmond mine acidophilic nanoorganisms which were discovered and are some the smallest organisms superphylum tack has been proposed that includes the aigarchaeota crenarchaeota korarchaeota and thaumarchaeota this superphylum may related the origin arman acid mine drainage species the classification archaea into species also biology defines species group related the familiar exclusive breeding criterion organisms that can breed with each other but not with others help because archaea reproduce archaea show high levels horizontal gene transfer between some researchers suggest that individuals can grouped into like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer from cells with related the genus ferroplasma the other studies halorubrum found significant genetic transfer from related limiting the second concern what extent such species designations have practical current knowledge genetic diversity fragmentary and the total number archaeal species cannot estimated with any estimates the number phyla range from which only have representatives that have been cultured and studied many these hypothesized groups are known from single rrna indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains the bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for origin and evolution phylogenetic tree eukaryotes bacteria timeline evolution scientific evidence suggests that life began earth least billion years ago the earliest evidences for life earth are graphite found biogenic billion old metasedimentary rocks discovered western greenland and microbial mat fossils found billion old sandstone discovered western australia although probable prokaryotic cell fossils date almost billion years ago most prokaryotes not have distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot used identify them instead chemical fossils unique lipids are more informative because such compounds not occur other some publications suggest that archaeal eukaryotic lipid remains are present shales dating from billion years such data have since been such lipids have also been detected even older rocks from west greenland the oldest such traces come from the isua district which include oldest formed billion years the archaeal lineage may the most ancient that exists woese argued that the archaea and eukaryotes represent separate lines descent that diverged early from ancestral colony one possibility that this occurred before the evolution cells when the lack typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer and that the common ancestors the three domains arose fixation specific subsets possible that the last common ancestor the bacteria and archaea was thermophile which raises the possibility that lower temperatures are extreme archaeal and organisms that live cooler environments appeared only since the archaea and bacteria are more related each other than they are the term prokaryote only surviving meaning not limiting its comparison other domains the following table describes some major characteristics that are generally shared archaea with the other two domains with illustrate the relationships many these characteristics are also discussed peptidoglycan pseudomurein histones operons methionine flagellin introns rna processing rna polymerase promoters atpase type fatty acid synthetase relationship other prokaryotes the relationship between the three domains central importance for understanding the origin most the metabolic which comprise the majority are common between archaea and while most genes involved genome expression are common between archaea and within archaeal cell structure most similar that positive largely because both have single lipid bilayer and usually contain thick sacculus varying chemical phylogenetic trees based upon different protein sequences prokaryotic the archaeal homologs are more closely related those positive archaea and positive bacteria also share conserved indels number important such hsp and glutamine synthetase gupta has proposed that the archaea evolved from positive bacteria response antibiotic selection this suggested the observation that archaea are resistant wide variety antibiotics that are primarily produced positive and that these antibiotics primarily act the genes that distinguish archaea from his proposal that the selective pressure towards resistance generated the positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient cause extensive changes many the target and that these strains represented the common ancestors day the evolution archaea response antibiotic any other competitive selective could also explain their adaptation extreme environments such high temperature the result search for unoccupied niches escape from producing cavalier smith has made similar gupta proposal also supported other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the relation eukaryotes the evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes remains aside from the similarities cell structure and function that are discussed many genetic trees group the complicating factors include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum crenarchaeota closer than the relationship between the euryarchaeota and the phylum crenarchaeota and the presence like genes certain such thermotoga maritima from horizontal gene transfer the standard hypothesis states that the ancestor the eukaryotes diverged early from the and that eukaryotes arose through fusion archaean and which became the nucleus and cytoplasm this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell alternative the eocyte hypothesis posits that eukaryota emerged relatively late from the morphology logarithmic scale individual archaea range from micrometers over and occur various commonly rods spirals other morphologies the crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells sulfolobus needle like filaments that are less than half micrometer diameter thermofilum and almost perfectly rectangular rods thermoproteus and pyrobaculum haloquadratum walsbyi are square archaea that live hypersaline these unusual shapes are probably maintained both their cell walls and prokaryotic cytoskeleton proteins related the cytoskeleton components other organisms exist and filaments form within their but contrast other these cellular structures are poorly thermoplasma and ferroplasma the lack cell wall means that the cells have irregular and can resemble amoebae some species form aggregates filaments cells these organisms can prominent biofilms notably aggregates thermococcus coalescens cells fuse together forming single giant archaea the genus pyrodictium produce elaborate multicell colony involving arrays thin hollow tubes called cannulae that stick out from the surfaces and connect them into dense like the function these cannulae not but they may allow communication nutrient exchange with multi species colonies such the community that was discovered german round whitish colonies novel euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range centimetres long these filaments are made particular bacteria structure composition operation archaea and bacteria have generally similar cell structure but cell composition and organization set the archaea like archaea lack interior membranes and organelles like archaea cell membranes are usually bounded cell wall and they swim using one more flagella structurally archaea are most similar gram positive bacteria most have single plasma membrane and cell and lack periplasmic space the exception this general rule ignicoccus which possess particularly large periplasm that contains bound vesicles and enclosed outer membranes top glycerol middle glycerol bottom archaeal membranes are made molecules that differ strongly from those other life showing that archaea are related only distantly bacteria and all organisms cell membranes are made molecules known phospholipids these molecules possess both polar part that dissolves water the phosphate head and greasy non polar part that does not the lipid these dissimilar parts are connected glycerol moiety phospholipids with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from the major structure cell membranes double layer these which called lipid bilayer these phospholipids are unusual four bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly ester lipids whereas archaea have membranes composed ether lipids the difference the type bond that joins the lipids the glycerol the two types are shown yellow the figure the ester lipids this ester bond whereas ether lipids this ether bond ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester this stability might help archaea survive extreme temperatures and very acidic alkaline environments bacteria and eukaryotes contain some ether but contrast archaea these lipids are not major part their the stereochemistry the glycerol moiety the reverse that found other the glycerol moiety can occur two forms that are mirror images one called the handed and handed chemistry these are called enantiomers just right hand does not fit easily into handed handed phospholipid generally cannot used made enzymes adapted for the handed this suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than bacteria and such enzymes developed very early suggesting early split from the other two archaeal lipid tails are chemically different from other archaeal lipids are based upon the isoprenoid sidechain and are long chains with multiple branches and sometimes even cyclopropane cyclohexane rings this contrast the fatty acids found other membranes which have straight chains with branches although isoprenoids play important role the biochemistry many only the archaea use them make these branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking high some archaea the lipid bilayer replaced the archaea fuse the tails two independent phospholipid molecules into single molecule with two polar heads bolaamphiphile this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able resist harsh for the lipids ferroplasma are this which thought aid this survival its highly acidic wall and flagella cell wall most archaea but not thermoplasma and ferroplasma possess cell most archaea the wall assembled from layer which form layer layer rigid array protein molecules that cover the outside the cell like chain mail this layer provides both chemical and physical and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell unlike archaea lack peptidoglycan their cell methanobacteriales have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan function and physical but pseudopeptidoglycan distinct chemical lacks amino acids and acetylmuramic acid archaea flagella operate like bacterial their long stalks are driven rotatory motors the these motors are powered the proton gradient across the however archaeal flagella are notably different composition and the two types flagella evolved from different the bacterial flagellum shares common ancestor with the type iii secretion system while archaeal flagella appear have evolved from bacterial type pili contrast the bacterial which hollow and assembled subunits moving the central pore the tip the archaeal flagella are synthesized adding subunits the metabolism microbial metabolism archaea exhibit great variety chemical reactions their metabolism and use many sources these reactions are classified into nutritional groups depending energy and carbon some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such sulfur ammonia they are lithotrophs these include nitrifiers methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers these reactions one compound passes electrons another redox reaction releasing energy fuel the one compound acts electron donor and one electron acceptor the energy released generates adenosine triphosphate through chemiosmosis the same basic process that happens the mitochondrion eukaryotic hot spring yellowstone national park other groups archaea use sunlight source energy they are phototrophs however oxygen generating photosynthesis does not occur any these many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms for archaea use modified form glycolysis the entner doudoroff pathway and either complete partial citric acid cycle these similarities other organisms probably reflect both early origins the history life and their high level phototrophs halobacteria lithotrophs carbon fixation ferroglobus methanobacteria pyrolobus organotrophs carbon fixation pyrococcus sulfolobus methanosarcinales some euryarchaeota are methanogens living anaerobic environments such this form metabolism evolved and even possible that the first living organism was common reaction involves the use carbon dioxide electron acceptor oxidize hydrogen methanogenesis involves range coenzymes that are unique these such coenzyme and methanofuran other organic compounds such alcohols acetic acid formic acid are used alternative electron acceptors these reactions are common gut dwelling acetic acid also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide acetotrophic archaea these acetotrophs are archaea the order methanosarcinales and are major part the communities microorganisms that produce biogas halobacterium salinarum cofactor stick models other archaea use the atmosphere source process called carbon fixation they are autotrophs this process involves either highly modified form the calvin cycle recently discovered metabolic pathway called the hydroxybutyrate the crenarchaeota also use the reverse krebs cycle while the euryarchaeota also use the reductive coa pathway carbon fixation powered inorganic energy known archaea carry out photosynthesis archaeal energy sources are extremely and range from the oxidation ammonia the nitrosopumilales the oxidation hydrogen sulfide elemental sulfur species sulfolobus using either oxygen metal ions electron phototrophic archaea use light produce chemical energy the form the halobacteria light activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients pumping ions out the cell across the plasma membrane the energy stored these electrochemical gradients then converted into atp atp synthase this process form photophosphorylation the ability these driven pumps move ions across membranes depends driven changes the structure retinol cofactor buried the center the genetics plasmid genome archaea usually have single circular chromosome the size which may great base pairs methanosarcina acetivorans the largest known archaeal one tenth this size the tiny pair genome nanoarchaeum equitans the smallest archaeal genome estimated contain only protein encoding smaller independent pieces called plasmids are also found plasmids may transferred between cells physical process that may similar bacterial conjugation sulfolobus micrometer archaea can infected stranded dna viruses that are unrelated any other form virus and have variety unusual including hooked these viruses have been studied most detail particularly the orders sulfolobales and two groups stranded dna viruses that infect archaea have been recently one group exemplified the halorubrum pleomorphic virus pleolipoviridae infecting halophilic archaea and the other one the aeropyrum shaped virus spiraviridae infecting hyperthermophilic optimal growth host notably the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssdna defenses against these viruses may involve rna interference from repetitive dna sequences that are related the genes the archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and with the proteins encoded any one archaeal genome being unique the although most these unique genes have known the remainder the unique proteins that have identified most belong the euryarchaea and are involved the proteins that bacteria and eukaryotes share form common core cell relating mostly transcription translation and nucleotide metabolism other characteristic archaeal features are the organization genes related such enzymes that catalyze steps the same metabolic pathway into novel operons and large differences trna genes and their aminoacyl trna synthetases transcription and translation archaea resemble these processes eukaryotes more than with the archaeal rna polymerase and ribosomes being very close their equivalents although archaea only have one type rna its structure and function transcription seems close that the eukaryotic rna polymerase with similar protein assemblies the general transcription factors directing the binding the rna polymerase promoter however other archaeal transcription factors are closer those found post transcriptional modification simpler than since most archaeal genes lack introns although there are many introns their transfer rna and ribosomal rna genes and introns may occur few encoding gene transfer and genetic exchange halobacterium volcanii extreme halophilic forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear used for transfer dna from one cell another either when the hyperthermophilic archaea sulfolobus solfataricus and sulfolobus acidocaldarius are exposed the dna damaging agents bleomycin mitomycin species specific cellular aggregation aggregation solfataricus could not induced other physical such temperature suggesting that aggregation induced specifically dna ajon showed that induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency acidocaldarius recombination rates exceeded those uninduced cultures three orders frols and ajon hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific dna transfer between sulfolobus cells order provide increased repair damaged dna means homologous this response may primitive form sexual interaction similar the more studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific dna transfer between cells leading homologous recombinational repair dna reproduction asexual reproduction archaea reproduce asexually binary multiple fission fragmentation budding meiosis does not species archaea exists more than one all have the same genetic cell division controlled cell cycle after the chromosome replicated and the two daughter chromosomes the cell details have only been investigated the genus sulfolobus but that cycle has characteristics that are similar both bacterial and eukaryotic the chromosomes replicate from multiple points origins replication using dna polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic however the proteins that direct cell such the protein ftsz which forms contracting ring around the and the components the septum that constructed across the center the are similar their bacterial both bacteria and but not make spores some species haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow several different cell including walled structures that are resistant osmotic shock and allow the archaea survive water low salt but these are not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new ecology habitats archaea exist broad range habitats and major part global ecosystems may contribute biomass the discovered archaeans were extremophiles indeed some archaea survive high often above found geysers black smokers and oil other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline acidic alkaline water however archaea include mesophiles that grow mild marshland sewage the oceans and soils plankton oceans extremophile archaea are members four main physiological groups these are the halophiles thermophiles alkaliphiles and acidophiles these groups are not comprehensive nor are they mutually since some archaea belong several nonetheless they are useful starting point for halophiles including the genus halobacterium live extremely saline environments such salt lakes and outnumber their bacterial counterparts salinities greater than thermophiles grow best temperatures above places such hot hyperthermophilic archaea grow optimally temperatures greater than the archaeal methanopyrus kandleri strain can even reproduce the highest recorded temperature any other archaea exist very acidic alkaline for one the most extreme archaean acidophiles picrophilus torridus which grows which equivalent thriving molar sulfuric acid this resistance extreme environments has made archaea the focus speculation about the possible properties extraterrestrial life some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar those mars leading the suggestion that viable microbes could transferred between planets meteorites recently several studies have shown that archaea exist not only mesophilic and thermophilic environments but are also sometimes high low temperatures for archaea are common cold oceanic environments such polar even more significant are the large numbers archaea found throughout the oceans extreme habitats among the plankton community part the picoplankton although these archaea can present extremely high numbers the microbial almost none these species have been isolated and studied pure culture consequently our understanding the role archaea ocean ecology their full influence global biogeochemical cycles remains largely some marine crenarchaeota are capable nitrification suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle although these oceanic crenarchaeota may also use other sources vast numbers archaea are also found the sediments that cover the sea floor with these organisms making the majority living cells depths over meter below the ocean role chemical cycling biogeochemical cycle archaea recycle elements such carbon nitrogen and sulfur through their various although these activities are vital for normal ecosystem function archaea can also contribute made and even cause pollution archaea carry out many steps the nitrogen cycle this includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from such nitrate based respiration and denitrification well processes that introduce such nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation archaean involvement ammonia oxidation reactions was recently these reactions are particularly important the the archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation they produce nitrite which other microbes then oxidize nitrate plants and other organisms consume the the sulfur cycle archaea that grow oxidizing sulfur compounds release this element from making available other however the archaea that such sulfolobus produce sulfuric acid waste and the growth these organisms abandoned mines can contribute acid mine drainage and other environmental the carbon cycle methanogen archaea remove hydrogen and are important the decay organic matter the populations microorganisms that act decomposers anaerobic such marshes and sewage treatment works methanogens are the primary source atmospheric methane and are responsible for most the yearly methane emissions these archaea contribute global greenhouse gas emissions and global warming global methane have risen ppb increase factor since industrial from ppb the highest value least years methane has anthropogenic global warming potential which means that times stronger than carbon dioxide over year time interactions with other organisms biological interaction symbiosis termites the characterized interactions between archaea and other organisms are either mutual commensal there are clear examples known archaeal pathogens parasites however relationship has been proposed between some species methanogens and infections the mouth and nanoarchaeum equitans may parasite another species since only survives and reproduces within the cells the crenarchaeon ignicoccus hospitalis and appears offer benefit its host archaeal richmond mine acidophilic nanoorganisms occasionally connect with other archaeal cells acid mine drainage the nature this relationship however distinct from that nanarchaeaum ignicoccus that the ultrasmall arman cells are usually seen independent the thermoplasmatales cells mutualism one understood example mutualism the interaction between protozoa and methanogenic archaea the digestive tracts animals that digest cellulose such ruminants and termites these anaerobic protozoa break down plant cellulose obtain this process releases hydrogen waste but high levels hydrogen reduce energy when methanogens convert hydrogen protozoa benefit from more anaerobic protozoa such plagiopyla frontata archaea reside inside the protozoa and consume hydrogen produced their hydrogenosomes archaea also associate with larger for the marine archaean cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within endosymbiont the sponge axinella mexicana commensalism archaea can also benefiting from association without helping harming the other for the methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii far the most common archaean the human flora making about one ten all the prokaryotes the human termites and these methanogens may fact interacting with other microbes the gut aid archaean communities also associate with range other such the surface corals and the region soil that surrounds plant roots the rhizosphere significance technology and industry biotechnology extremophile archaea particularly those resistant either heat extremes acidity and are source enzymes that function under these harsh these enzymes have found many for thermostable dna polymerases such the pfu dna polymerase from pyrococcus furiosus revolutionized molecular biology allowing the polymerase chain reaction used research simple and rapid technique for cloning dna amylases galactosidases and pullulanases other species pyrococcus that function over allow food processing high such the production low lactose milk and whey enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend very stable organic allowing their use environmentally friendly processes green chemistry that synthesize organic this stability makes them easier use structural biology consequently the counterparts bacterial eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used structural contrast the range applications archaean the use the organisms themselves biotechnology less methanogenic archaea are vital part sewage treatment since they are part the community microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas mineral processing acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction metals from ores including gold cobalt and copper archaea host new class potentially useful antibiotics few these archaeocins have been but hundreds more are believed especially within haloarchaea and sulfolobus these compounds differ structure from bacterial they may have novel modes they may allow the creation new selectable markers for use archaeal molecular see also aerobic
