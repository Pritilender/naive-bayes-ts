canidae fischer waldheim see text the canidae are the biological family carnivorans that includes domestic dogs wolves foxes jackals coyotes and many other lesser known extant and extinct like member this family called canid the canidae family divided into two tribes canini related and vulpini related canids have long evolutionary the about million years the carnivorans split into two the caniforms and feliforms the some ten million years the first proper canids had appeared and the family had split into three hesperocyoninae borophaginae and caninae only the last these has survived until the present canids are found all continents except antarctica and vary size from the gray wolf the long fennec fox the body forms canids are typically having long upright teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing long legs and bushy they are mostly social living together family units small groups and behaving typically only the dominant pair group and litter young reared annually

recent dna analysis shows that there are three monophyletic clades two the south american canine group and the wolf together form the tribe the third clade the fox tribe molecular data imply north american origin living canidae some ten million years ago and african origin like canines canis cuon and lycaon with the jackals being the most basal this the south american clade rooted the maned wolf and bush and the like canids the fennec fox and the grey fox and island fox are basal the other currently the domestic dog listed subspecies canis lupus familiaris and the dingo also considered domestic dingo provisionally separate subspecies from familiaris the red wolf eastern canadian wolf and indian wolf are recognized subspecies many sources list the domestic dog canis familiaris but including the smithsonian institution and the american society mammalogists more precisely list subspecies familiaris the red eastern canadian and indian wolf may may not separate species the the dingo has been variously classified canis dingo canis familiaris dingo and canis lupus familiaris dingo the gray wolf can disperse with some animals moving over miles from their place but analysis mtdna does not support the existence multiple virtually identical genotypes were identified from far apart alaska and southern nor could significant genetic differences detected between widely separated populations evolution the canidae includes diverse group some species ranging size from the maned wolf with its long limbs the legged bush modern canids inhabit tundra savannahs and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts the the evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied the past using morphological approaches but more molecular studies have enabled the investigation phylogenetic relationships some genetic divergence has been suppressed the high level gene flow between different populations and where the species have large hybrid zones exist eocene epoch carnivorans evolved from miacoids about million years ago mya during the late paleocene some five million years the carnivorans split into two main caniforms and feliforms mya the first member the dog family proper had called prohesperocyon wilsoni its fossilized remains have been found what now the southwestern part the chief features which identify canid include the loss the upper third molar part trend toward more shearing and the structure the middle ear which has enlarged bulla the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts the prohesperocyon probably had slightly longer limbs than its and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from the splayed arrangements the digits the canidae family soon subdivided into three each which diverged during the hesperocyoninae about mya borophaginae about mya and caninae about mya the caninae the only surviving subfamily and all day canids including foxes coyotes jackals and domestic dogs belong members each subfamily showed increase body mass with time and some exhibited specialised hypercarnivorous diets that made them prone view discuss cretaceous quaternary ocene eocene oligocene pliocene miocene mass extinction first hesperocyoninae first borophaginae caninae modern looking dogs canine radiation cenozoic mesozoic oligocene epoch the all three subfamilies canids borophaginae and had appeared the fossil records north the earliest and most primitive branch the canidae was the hesperocyoninae which included the sized mesocyon the oligocene mya these early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit prey grassland they resembled modern civets hesperocyonines eventually became extinct the middle one the early member the the genus hesperocyon gave rise archaeocyon and leptocyon these branches led the borophagine and canine miocene epoch around mya during the late miocene canis urocyon and vulpes genera expanded from southwestern north america where the canine radiation the success these canines was related the development lower carnassials that were capable both mastication and around mya the beringian land bridge allowed members the genus eucyon means enter asia and they continued colonise pliocene epoch during the pliocene around mya canis lepophagus appeared north this was small and sometimes others were like canis latrans the theorized have descended from canis lepophagus the formation the isthmus panama about mya joined south america north allowing canids invade south america where they however the most recent common ancestor the south american canids lived north america some mya and the likelihood that there were more than one incursion across the new land one the resulting lineages consisted the gray fox urocyon cinereoargentus and the now extinct dire wolf canis dirus the other lineage consisted the called south american endemic the maned wolf chrysocyon brachyurus the eared dog atelocynus microtis the bush dog speothos venaticus the eating fox cerdocyon thous and the south american foxes lycalopex spp the monophyly this group has been established molecular pleistocene epoch during the pleistocene the north american wolf line with canis edwardii clearly identifiable and canis rufus appeared possibly direct descendent canis edwardii around mya canis ambrusteri emerged north large was found all over north and central and was eventually supplanted its the dire which then spread into south america during the late mya number subspecies the gray wolf canis lupus had developed and had spread throughout europe and northern the gray wolf colonized north america during the late rancholabrean era across the bering land there being least three separate with each one consisting one more different eurasian gray wolf clades mtdna studies have shown that there are least four extant lupus lineages the dire wolf shared its habitat with the gray wolf but became extinct scale extinction event that occurred around years may have been more scavenger than its molars appear adapted for crushing bones and may have died out result the extinction the large herbivorous animals whose carcases characteristics grey wolf golden jackal dhole wild canids are found every continent except and inhabit wide range different including deserts mountains forests and grasslands they vary size from the fennec fox long the gray wolf which may long and can weigh only few species are arboreal the north american gray the closely related channel island and the raccoon dog habitually climb all canids have similar basic exemplified the grey although the relative length limbs ears and tail vary considerably between with the exceptions the bush raccoon and some domestic breeds canis lupus canids have relatively long legs and lithe adapted for chasing the tails are bushy and the length and quality the pelage varies with the the muzzle portion the skull much more elongated than that the cat the zygomatic arches are there transverse lambdoidal ridge the rear the cranium and some sagittal crest running from front the bony orbits around the eye never form complete ring and the auditory bullae are smooth and all canids are digitigrade meaning they walk their the tip the nose always are the cushioned pads the soles the these latter consist single pad behind the tip each toe and less lobed central pad under the roots the hairs grow between the pads and the arctic the sole the foot densely covered with hair some times with the exception the toed african hunting dog lycaon pictus there are five toes the forefeet but the pollex reduced and does not reach the the hind there are four but some domestic fifth vestigial known dewclaw sometimes present but has anatomical connection the rest the the slightly curved nails are retractile and more less the penis male canids supported bone called the baculum also contains structure the base called the bulbus glandis which helps create copulatory tie during locking the animals together for young canids are born with their eyes opening few weeks after all living canids have ligament analogous the nuchal ligament ungulates used maintain the posture the head and neck with little active muscle this ligament allows them conserve energy while running long distances following scent trails with their nose the however based skeletal details the least some borophaginae such aelurodon are believed have lacked this dentition eurasian wolf most canids have teeth with dental formula the bush dog has only only one upper molar with two the dhole has two above and two and the eared fox has three four upper molars and four lower other members carnivora the upper fourth premolar and lower first molar are adapted carnassial teeth for slicing although the eared fox differs this being largely the molar teeth are strong most allowing the animals crack open bone reach the marrow the baby formula canids molars being completely social behavior american bison yellowstone national park gray wolf behaviour dog behavior red fox behaviour african wild dog social structure almost all canids are social animals and live together most and many the true male and female pair work together hunt and raise their gray wolves and some the other larger canids live larger groups called packs african wild dogs have packs which may consist twenty forty and packs fewer than about seven individuals may incapable successful hunting packs has the advantage that larger prey items can some species form packs live small family groups depending the including the type available most some individuals live their within canid there system dominance that the most experienced animals lead the most the dominant male and female are the only pack members canids communicate with each other scent signals visual clues and and vocalizations such barks and most groups have home territory from which they drive out other conspecifics the territory marked leaving urine scent marks which warn trespassing social behaviour also mediated secretions from glands the upper surface the tail near its root and from the anal glands reproduction canine reproduction canids group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals they are typically monogamous provide paternal care their have reproductive cycles with lengthy proestral and diestral phases and have copulatory tie during they also retain adult offspring the social suppressing the ability these breed while making use the alloparental care they can provide help raise the next generation during the proestral increased levels estradiol make the female attractive the there rise progesterone during the oestral phase and the female now following the level estradiol fluctuates and there lengthy diestrous phase during which the female pseudo pregnancy frequently occurs canids that have ovulated but failed period anoestrus follows pregnancy there being only one oestral period during each breeding small and sized canids mostly have gestation period fifty sixty days while larger species average sixty five the time year which the breeding season occurs related the length has been demonstrated the case several species that have been translocated across the equator the other hemisphere and experiences six month shift domestic dogs and certain small canids captivity may come into oestrus more perhaps because the photoperiod stimulus breaks down under conditions artificial canids are territorial have home range and sleep the using their dens only for breeding and sometimes bad the size litter with from one sixteen more pups being the young are born blind and helpless and require long period parental they are kept most often dug into the for warmth and when the young begin eating solid both and often other pack bring food back for them from the this most often vomited from the where such pack involvement the feeding the litter the breeding success rate higher than the case where females split from the group and rear their pups young canids may take year mature and learn the skills they need some such the african wild male offspring usually remain the natal while females disperse and join another small group the opposite sex form new canids and humans fox hunt one the domestic dog subspecies the gray entered into partnership with humans long time this partnership documented far back years when the footprints young boy aged about eight ten was found chauvet cave southern walking alongside what was identified large dog the earliest recorded fossil dog was found around years ago goyet cave even wolves were found fossilized the same locations humans sites that date back years showing how far back humans and wolves had interactions with one studies using chromosome and mtdna have shown that the wolf was first domesticated area south the yangtze river the fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been the reason that the relationship humans benefited from the cooperation teamwork alertness and tracking abilities while the wolf may have benefited from the use weapons tackle larger prey and the sharing humans and dogs evolved the bond between humans and dogs can seen the burial dogs with their owners early years ago the americas and years ago among only the gray wolf has widely been known prey nonetheless least two records have coyotes killing and two have golden jackals killing human beings have trapped and hunted some canid species for their fur especially the gray coyote and the red for canids such the dhole
