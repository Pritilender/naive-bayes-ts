cellular differentiation navigation search cell differentiation developmental biology cellular differentiation the process which less specialized cell becomes more specialized cell type differentiation occurs numerous times during the development multicellular organism the organism changes from simple zygote complex system tissues and cell differentiation continues adulthood adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell differentiation dramatically changes shape membrane potential metabolic activity and responsiveness these changes are largely due highly controlled modifications gene expression with few cellular differentiation almost never involves change the dna sequence thus different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome cell that can differentiate into all cell types the adult organism known pluripotent such cells are called embryonic stem cells animals and meristematic cells higher cell that can differentiate into all cell types including the placental known totipotent only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are while plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory cytopathology the level cellular differentiation used measure cancer progression grade marker how differentiated cell tumor contents

body three basic categories cells make the mammalian germ cells somatic cells and stem cells each the approximately trillion cells adult human has its own copy copies the genome except certain cell such red blood cells that lack nuclei their fully differentiated most cells are diploid they have two copies each chromosome such called somatic make most the human such skin and muscle cells differentiate specialize for different citation needed germ line cells are any line cells that give rise gametes eggs and and thus are continuous through the stem the other have the ability divide for indefinite periods and give rise specialized they are best described the context normal human citation needed development begins when sperm fertilizes egg and creates single cell that has the potential form entire the first hours after this cell divides into identical approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles cell these cells begin forming hollow sphere called blastocyst the blastocyst has outer layer and inside this hollow there cluster cells called the inner cell mass the cells the inner cell mass form virtually all the tissues the human although the cells the inner cell mass can form virtually every type cell found the human they cannot form these cells are referred pluripotent citation needed pluripotent stem cells undergo further specialization into multipotent progenitor cells that then give rise functional examples stem and progenitor cells citation needed hematopoietic stem cells adult stem from the bone marrow that give rise red blood cells white blood cells and platelets mesenchymal stem cells adult stem from the bone marrow that give rise stromal fat and types bone cells epithelial stem cells progenitor that give rise the various types skin cells muscle satellite cells progenitor that contribute differentiated muscle tissue pathway that guided the cell adhesion molecules consisting four amino arginine glycine asparagine and serine created the cellular blastomere differentiates from the layered blastula the three primary layers germ cells namely the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm listed from most distal proximal the ectoderm ends forming the skin and the nervous the mesoderm forms the bones and muscular and the endoderm forms the internal organ dedifferentiation micrograph liposarcoma lipoblasts vascularity adipose tissue stain dedifferentiation cellular process often seen more basal life forms such worms and amphibians which partially terminally differentiated cell reverts earlier developmental usually part regenerative process dedifferentiation also occurs cells cell culture can lose properties they originally such protein change this process also termed some believe dedifferentiation aberration the normal development cycle that results cancer whereas others believe natural part the immune response lost humans some point result small molecule dubbed reversine purine analog has been discovered that has proven induce dedifferentiation myotubes these dedifferentiated cells could then redifferentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes dedifferentiation totipotency overview mechanisms each specialized cell type organism expresses subset all the genes that constitute the genome that species each cell type defined its particular pattern regulated gene expression cell differentiation thus transition cell from one cell type another and involves switch from one pattern gene expression cellular differentiation during development can understood the result gene regulatory network regulatory gene and its regulatory modules are nodes gene regulatory they receive input and create output elsewhere the the systems biology approach developmental biology emphasizes the importance investigating how developmental mechanisms interact produce predictable patterns morphogenesis alternative view has been proposed based stochastic gene cellular differentiation the result darwinian selective process occurring among this protein and gene networks are the result cellular processes and not their see cellular darwinism few evolutionarily conserved types molecular processes are often involved the cellular mechanisms that control these the major types molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve cell signaling many the signal molecules that convey information from cell cell during the control cellular differentiation are called growth factors although the details specific signal transduction pathways these pathways often share the following general ligand produced one cell binds receptor the extracellular region another inducing conformational change the the shape the cytoplasmic domain the receptor and the receptor acquires enzymatic the receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other activating cascade phosphorylation reactions eventually activates dormant transcription factor cytoskeletal thus contributing the differentiation process the target cells and tissues can vary their ability respond external signal induction refers cascades signaling during which cell tissue signals another cell tissue influence its developmental yamamoto and jeffery investigated the role the lens eye formation and dwelling striking example through reciprocal yamamoto and jeffery found that the lens vesicle surface fish can induce other parts the eye develop and dwelling while the lens vesicle the dwelling fish other important mechanisms fall under the category asymmetric cell divisions divisions that give rise daughter cells with distinct developmental asymmetric cell divisions can occur because asymmetrically expressed maternal cytoplasmic determinants because the former distinct daughter cells are created during cytokinesis because uneven distribution regulatory molecules the parent the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results distinct pattern differentiation for each daughter studied example pattern formation asymmetric divisions body axis patterning drosophila rna molecules are important type intracellular differentiation control the molecular and genetic basis asymmetric cell divisions has also been studied green algae the genus volvox model system for studying how unicellular organisms can evolve into multicellular volvox carteri the cells the anterior hemisphere cell embryo divide each producing one large and one small daughter the size the cell the end all cell divisions determines whether becomes specialized germ somatic epigenetic control cellular differentiation epigenetics stem cell differentiation since each regardless cell possesses the same genome determination cell type must occur the level gene expression while the regulation gene expression can occur through cis and trans regulatory elements including promoter and enhancers the problem arises how this expression pattern maintained over numerous generations cell division turns epigenetic processes play crucial role regulating the decision adopt progenitor mature cell this section will focus primarily mammalian stem cells importance epigenetic control the first question that can asked the extent and complexity the role epigenetic processes the determination cell clear answer this question can seen the paper lister aberrant epigenomic programming human induced pluripotent stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells are thought mimic embryonic stem cells their pluripotent few epigenetic differences should exist between test this the authors conducted genome profiling dna methylation patterns several human embryonic stem cell ipsc and progenitor cell female adipose cells lung fibroblasts and foreskin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent state with the oct sox klf and myc genes patterns dna methylation ipscs somatic cells were lister observed significant resemblance methylation levels between embryonic and induced pluripotent around dinucleotides escs and ipscs were the same was true only dinucleotides somatic somatic cells possessed minimal levels cytosine methylation while induced pluripotent cells possessed similar levels methylation embryonic stem between and thus consistent with their respective transcriptional dna methylation least the genomic are similar between escs and however upon examining methylation patterns more the authors discovered regions differential dinucleotide methylation between least one ips cell comparing these regions differential methylation with regions cytosine methylation the original somatic differentially methylated regions reflected methylation patterns the respective progenitor somatic while these regions were dissimilar both the progenitor and embryonic cell vitro induced differentiation ipsc lines saw transmission and hyper and methylated differentially methylated respectively two conclusions are readily apparent from this first epigenetic processes are heavily involved cell fate seen from the similar levels cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem consistent with their respective patterns transcription second the mechanisms differentiation and differentiation are very complex and cannot easily seen the significant number differentially methylated regions between and ips cell now that these two points have been can examine some the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought regulate cellular mechanisms epigenetic regulation pioneering factors sox nanog three transcription oct sox and nanog the first two which are used ipsc reprogramming are highly expressed undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are necessary for the maintenance their pluripotency thought that they achieve this through alterations chromatin structure such histone modification and dna restrict permit the transcription target polycomb repressive complex the realm gene silencing polycomb repressive complex one two classes the polycomb group family catalyzes the and methylation histone lysine binding the tagged prc also complex pcg family catalyzes the ubiquitinylation histone lysine blocking rna polymerase activity and resulting transcriptional pcg knockout cells not differentiate efficiently into the three germ and deletion the and genes leads increased expression affiliated genes and unscheduled presumably pcg complexes are responsible for transcriptionally repressing differentiation and promoting trithorax group proteins alternately upon receiving differentiation pcg proteins are recruited promoters pluripotency transcription pcg deficient cells can begin differentiation but cannot maintain the differentiated simultaneously differentiation and promoting genes are activated trithorax group chromatin regulators and lose their trxg proteins are recruited regions high transcriptional where they catalyze the trimethylation histone lysine and promote gene activation through histone pcg and trxg complexes engage direct competition and are thought functionally creating differentiation and promoting loci what termed bivalent and rendering these genes sensitive rapid induction dna methylation regulation gene expression further achieved through dna which the dna methyltransferase mediated methylation cytosine residues cpg dinucleotides maintains heritable repression controlling dna the majority cpg sites embryonic stem cells are unmethylated and appear associated with carrying upon small number including and are methylated and their promoters repressed prevent their further consistently dna deficient embryonic stem cells rapidly enter apoptosis upon vitro nucleosome positioning while the dna sequence almost all cells organism the the binding patterns transcription factors and the corresponding gene expression patterns are large differences transcription factor binding are determined the chromatin accessibility their binding sites through histone modification and pioneer factors important know whether nucleosome covering given genomic binding site recent studies have elucidated the role nucleosome positioning during stem cell role signaling epigenetic control final question ask concerns the role cell signaling influencing the epigenetic processes governing such role should would reasonable think that extrinsic signaling can lead epigenetic just can lead changes gene expression through the activation repression different transcription interestingly little direct data available concerning the specific signals that influence the epigenome and the majority current knowledge consist speculations plausible candidate regulators epigenetic will first discuss several major candidates thought involved the induction and maintenance both embryonic stem cells and their differentiated and then turn one example specific signaling pathways which more direct evidence exists for its role epigenetic the first major candidate wnt signaling pathway the wnt pathway involved all stages and the ligand can substitute for the overexpression myc the generation induced pluripotent stem the other disruption catenin component the wnt signaling leads decreased proliferation neural growth factors comprise the second major set candidates epigenetic regulators cellular these morphogens are crucial for and include bone morphogenetic proteins transforming growth factors and fibroblast growth factors tgfs and fgfs have been shown sustain expression sox and nanog downstream signaling smad proteins depletion growth factors promotes the differentiation while genes with bivalent chromatin can become either more restrictive permissive their several other signaling pathways are also considered primary cytokine leukemia inhibitory factors are associated with the maintenance mouse escs undifferentiated this achieved through its activation the pathway which has been shown necessary and sufficient towards maintaining mouse esc retinoic acid can induce differentiation human and mouse and notch signaling involved the proliferation and renewal stem finally sonic hedgehog addition its role promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation and the renewal somatic stem the that the candidacy these signaling pathways was inferred primarily the basis their role development and cellular while epigenetic regulation necessary for driving cellular they are certainly not sufficient for this direct modulation gene expression through modification transcription factors plays key role that must distinguished from heritable epigenetic changes that can persist even the absence the
