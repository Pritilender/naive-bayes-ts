biology	chloroplast chloroplasts navigation search plagiomnium affine chloroplasts are organelles specialized plant and algal cells their main role conduct photosynthesis where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and stores the energy storage molecules atp and nadph while freeing oxygen from they then use the atp and nadph make organic molecules from carbon dioxide process known the calvin cycle chloroplasts carry out number other including fatty acid synthesis much amino acid synthesis and the immune response chloroplast one three types plastid characterized its high concentration chlorophyll the other two the leucoplast and the chromoplast contain little chlorophyll and not carry out chloroplasts are highly they circulate and are moved around within plant and occasionally pinch two their behavior strongly influenced environmental factors like light color and chloroplasts like mitochondria contain their own dna which thought inherited from their photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed early eukaryotic cell chloroplasts cannot made the plant and must inherited each daughter cell during cell with one exception member the genus paulinella all chloroplasts can probably traced back single endosymbiotic event the cyanobacterium being engulfed the despite chloroplasts can found extremely wide set some not even directly related each consequence many secondary and even tertiary endosymbiotic events the word chloroplast derived from the greek words chloros which means and plastes which means the one who

chloroplast inheritance transplastomic plants references external links chloroplast lineages and evolution chloroplasts are one many types organelles the plant they are considered have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis when eukaryotic cell engulfed photosynthesizing cyanobacterium which remained and became permanent resident the mitochondria are thought have come from similar where robic prokaryote was this origin chloroplasts was first suggested russian biologist konstantin mereschkowski after andreas schimper observed that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria chloroplasts are only found plants and algae cyanobacterial ancestor cyanobacteria cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors they are sometimes called green algae even though they are prokaryotes they are diverse phylum bacteria capable carrying out photosynthesis and are gram negative meaning they have two cell they also contain peptidoglycan cell wall which thicker than other negative and which located between their two cell like they have thylakoids inside the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll phycobilins are also common cyanobacterial usually organized into hemispherical phycobilisomes attached the outside the thylakoid membranes phycobilins are not shared with all chloroplasts cyanobacteria dna ribosomes thylakoids higher plant primary endosymbiosis primary endosymbiosis mitochondria cyanobacterium serial lineage cyanobacterial phagosomal vacuole somewhere around billion years living cyanobacterium entered early eukaryotic cell either food internal parasite and managed escape the phagocytic vacuole was contained the two innermost lipid bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond the outer and inner membranes the ancestral gram negative cell and not the phagosomal membrane from the which was probably the new cellular resident quickly became providing food for the eukaryotic which allowed live within over the cyanobacterium was and many its genes were lost transferred the nucleus the some its proteins were then synthesized the cytoplasm the host and imported back into the this event called endosymbiosis cell living inside another the cell living inside the other cell called the endosymbiont the endosymbiont found inside the host cell chloroplasts are believed have arisen after mitochondria since all eukaryotes contain but not all have this called serial endosymbiosis early eukaryote engulfing the mitochondrion ancestor and some descendants then engulfing the chloroplast creating cell with both chloroplasts and whether not chloroplasts came from single endosymbiotic many independent engulfments across various eukaryotic lineages has been long but now generally held that all organisms with chloroplasts either share single ancestor obtained their chloroplast from organisms that share common ancestor that took cyanobacterium million years these which can traced back directly cyanobacterial ancestor are known primary plastids plastid this context means the almost the same thing chloroplast all primary chloroplasts belong one three chloroplast the glaucophyte chloroplast the rhodophyte red algal chloroplast the chloroplastidan green chloroplast the second two are the and the green chloroplast lineage the one that contains the land plants glaucophyta chloroplast lineages endosymbiosis glaucophytes chlorophyta rhodophyta algae the apicomplexans malaria contain red algal endosymbiont with photosynthetic chloroplast membranes chloroplast membranes chloroplastida land plants green algae euglenophyta chlorarachniophyta green algal dinophytes apicomplexa peridinin type dinophytes cryptophyta haptophyta haptophyte dinophytes heterokontophyta diatom dinophytes primary endosymbiosis secondary endosymbiosis tertiary endosymbiosis glaucophyta cyanobacteria the alga cyanophora glaucophyte thought one the first organisms contain the glaucophyte chloroplast group the smallest the three primary chloroplast being found only thirteen and thought the one that branched off the glaucophytes have chloroplasts which retain peptidoglycan wall between their double like their cyanobacterial parent for this glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known muroplasts glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids which surround carboxysome icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco the starch they synthesize collects outside the like glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes for these glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts red algae and plants diversity red algae bornetia secundiflora peyssonnelia squamaria cyanidium laurencia callophyllis laciniata phycobilin rhodophyce red the rhodophyte red algal chloroplast group another large and diverse chloroplast rhodophyte chloroplasts are also called rhodoplasts literally red rhodoplasts have double membrane with intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes the thylakoid preventing their thylakoids from some contain pyrenoids rhodoplasts have chlorophyll and phycobilins for photosynthetic the phycobilin phycoerytherin responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color however since they also contain the green chlorophyll and other many are reddish purple from the the red phycoerytherin pigment adaptation help red algae catch more sunlight deep water some red algae that live shallow water have less phycoerytherin their and can appear more rhodoplasts synthesize form starch called floridean which collects into granules outside the the cytoplasm the red chloroplastida green algae and diversity green algae scenedesmus micrasterias hydrodictyon stigeoclonium volvox chlorophyll chlorophyll the chloroplastidan chloroplasts green chloroplasts are another highly diverse primary chloroplast their host organisms are commonly known the green algae and land plants they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts that they have lost their phycobilisomes and contain chlorophyll instead most green chloroplasts are green though some like some forms matococcus pluvialis due accessory pigments that override the green chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double and have replaced with intermembrane some plants seem have kept the genes for the synthesis the peptidoglycan layer though been repurposed for use chloroplast division instead most the chloroplasts depicted this article are green green algae and plants keep their starch inside their and plants and some the chloroplast thylakoids are arranged grana some green algal chloroplasts contain structure called pyrenoid which functionally similar the glaucophyte carboxysome that where rubisco and are concentrated the transmission electron micrograph chlamydomonas reinhardtii helicosproidia the helicosproidia are nonphotosynthetic parasitic green algae that are thought contain vestigial genes from chloroplast and nuclear genes indicating the presence chloroplast have been found even seen the chloroplast secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis many other organisms obtained chloroplasts from the primary chloroplast lineages through secondary engulfing red green alga that contained these chloroplasts are known secondary while primary chloroplasts have double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside the original result the secondary endosymbiotic when nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed containing alga but failed digest much like the cyanobacterium the beginning this the engulfed alga was broken leaving only its and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus forming chloroplast with three four membranes the two cyanobacterial sometimes the eaten cell and the phagosomal vacuole from the cell eukaryotic alga nucleomorph the genes the phagocytosed nucleus are often transferred the secondary cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes retain the phagocytosed object called nucleomorph located between the second and third membranes the all secondary chloroplasts come from green and red algae secondary chloroplasts from glaucophytes have been probably because glaucophytes are relatively rare making them less likely have been taken another green algal derived chloroplasts green algae have been taken the euglenids chlorarachniophytes lineage dinoflagellates and possibly the ancestor the chromalveolates three four separate many green algal derived chloroplasts contain pyrenoids but unlike chloroplasts their green algal starch collects granules outside the euglena euglenophyte euglenophytes euglenophytes are group common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from green euglenophyte chloroplasts have three thought that the membrane the primary endosymbiont was leaving the cyanobacterial and the secondary phagosomal euglenophyte chloroplasts have pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked groups starch stored the form paramylon which contained bound granules the cytoplasm the chlorarachnion reptans red algal green alga chlorarachniophytes chlorarachniophytes are rare group organisms that also contain chloroplasts derived from green though their story more complicated than that the the ancestor chlorarachniophytes thought have been chromalveolate eukaryote with red algal derived then thought have lost its first red algal and later engulfed green giving its green algal derived chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are bounded four except near the cell where the chloroplast membranes fuse into double their thylakoids are arranged loose stacks chlorarachniophytes have form starch called chrysolaminarin which they store the often collected around the chloroplast pyrenoid which bulges into the chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are notable because the green alga they are derived from has not been completely broken its nucleus still persists nucleomorph found between the second and third chloroplast membranes the periplastid space which corresponds the green early chromalveolates recent research has suggested that the ancestor the chromalveolates acquired green algal prasinophyte endosymbiont the green algal derived chloroplast was lost and replaced with red algal derived but not before contributing some its genes the early the presence both green algal and red algal genes chromalveolates probably helps them thrive under fluctuating light red algal derived chloroplasts chromalveolate like green algae red algae have also been taken secondary though thought that all red algal derived chloroplasts are descended from single red alga that was engulfed early chromalveolate giving rise the chromalveolates some like the ciliates subsequently lost the this still debated pyrenoids and stacked thylakoids are common chromalveolate and the outermost membrane many are continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and studded with ribosomes they have lost their phycobilisomes and exchanged them for chlorophyll which found primary red algal chloroplasts rhodomonas salina cryptophyte cryptophytes cryptophytes cryptomonads are group algae that contain algal derived cryptophyte chloroplasts contain nucleomorph that superficially resembles that the chlorarachniophytes cryptophyte chloroplasts have four the outermost which continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum they synthesize ordinary starch which stored granules found the periplastid space outside the original double the place that corresponds the red inside cryptophyte chloroplasts pyrenoid and thylakoids stacks their chloroplasts not have phycobilisomes but they have phycobilin pigments which they keep their thylakoid rather than anchored the outside their thylakoid scanning electron micrograph gephyrocapsa oceanica haptophytes haptophytes are similar and closely related and are thought the first chromalveolates branch their chloroplasts lack their thylakoids are stacks and they synthesize chrysolaminarin sugar which they store completely outside the the cytoplasm the heterokontophytes diatoms the heterokontophytes also known the are very large and diverse group algae that also contain red algal derived heterokonts include the diatoms and the brown algae golden algae and yellow green algae heterokont chloroplasts are very similar haptophyte containing pyrenoid triplet and with some having epiplastid membrane connected the endoplasmic reticulum like heterokontophytes store sugar chrysolaminarin granules the heterokontophyte chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and with few exceptions chlorophyll but also have carotenoids which give them their many cyanobacteria plastida land plants glaucophyta green algae excavata euglenophyta rhodophyta chromalveolata paulinella chlorarachniophyta haptophyta cryptophyta heterokontophyta dinoflagellata apicomplexa ciliatea possible cladogram chloroplast evolution endosymbiotic dinophyte chromalveolata paraphyletic rhizaria apicomplexans apicomplexans are another group like the helicosproidia they and have nonphotosynthetic they were once thought related the but now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates the apicomplexans include plasmodium the malaria parasite many apicomplexans keep vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called apicoplast which they inherited from their other apicomplexans like cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast apicomplexans store their energy amylopectin starch granules that are located their even though they are apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic and contain photosynthetic pigments true they are bounded four but the membranes are not connected the endoplasmic reticulum the fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides and apicoplasts are they synthesize fatty acids isopentenyl pyrophosphate iron sulfur clusters and carry out part the heme pathway this makes the apicoplast attractive target for drugs cure related the most important apicoplast function isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast and when apicomplexans are grown isopentenyl rich they dump the dinophytes the dinoflagellates are yet another very large and diverse group protists around half which are least partially photosynthetic most dinophyte chloroplasts are secondary red algal derived like other chromalveolate many other dinophytes have lost the chloroplast becoming the nonphotosynthetic kind replaced though tertiary endosymbiosis the engulfment another chromalveolate containing red algal derived others replaced their original chloroplast with green algal derived most dinophyte chloroplasts contain least the photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll chlorophyll beta carotene and least one unique xanthophyll peridinin dinoxanthin diadinoxanthin giving many brown all dinophytes store starch their and most have chloroplasts with thylakoids arranged stacks peridinin containing dinophyte chloroplast ceratium furca peridinin the most common dinophyte chloroplast the peridinin type characterized the carotenoid pigment peridinin their along with chlorophyll and chlorophyll peridinin not found any other group the peridinin chloroplast bounded three membranes occasionally having lost the red algal original cell the outermost membrane not connected the endoplasmic they contain pyrenoid and have stacked starch found outside the chloroplast important feature these chloroplasts that their chloroplast dna highly reduced and fragmented into many small most the genome has migrated the and only critical related genes remain the the peridinin chloroplast thought the original chloroplast which has been reduced replaced has company several other dinophyte fucoxanthin containing dinophyte chloroplasts haptophyte karenia brevis fucoxanthin algal blooms red tides the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages including karlodinium and karenia lost their original red algal derived and replaced with new chloroplast derived from haptophyte endosymbiont karlodinium and karenia probably took different because the haptophyte chloroplast has four tertiary endosymbiosis would expected create six membraned adding the cell membrane and the phagosomal vacuole however the haptophyte was heavily stripped few membranes and its leaving only its chloroplast with its original double and possibly one two additional membranes around fucoxanthin containing chloroplasts are characterized having the pigment fucoxanthin actually fucoxanthin and fucoxanthin and fucoxanthin also found haptophyte providing evidence dinophysis acuminata cryptophyte cryptophyte derived dinophyte chloroplast members the genus dinophysis have phycobilin containing chloroplast taken from cryptophyte however the cryptophyte not only the chloroplast seems have been and the chloroplast has been stripped its nucleomorph and outermost two leaving just membraned cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph maintain and dinophysis species grown cell culture alone cannot possible but not that the dinophysis chloroplast kleptoplast dinophysis chloroplasts wear out and dinophysis species must continually engulf cryptophytes obtain new chloroplasts replace the old diatom derived dinophyte chloroplasts some like kryptoperidinium and durinskia have diatom heterokontophyte derived these chloroplasts are bounded five membranes depending whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont the just the red algal derived chloroplast inside the diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively still retains its original mitochondria and has endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes nucleus and red algal derived practically complete cell all inside the endoplasmic reticulum lumen however the diatom endosymbiont store its own its starch found granules the dinophyte cytoplasm the diatom nucleus but probably called nucleomorph because shows sign genome reduction and might have even been expanded diatoms have been engulfed dinoflagellates least three the diatom endosymbiont bounded single inside are chloroplasts with four like the diatom diatom the chloroplasts have triplet thylakoids and pyrenoids some these genera the diatom chloroplasts the only chloroplasts the the original membraned peridinin chloroplast still converted eyespot prasinophyte green derived dinophyte chloroplast lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced with green algal derived chloroplast more prasinophyte lepidodinium the only dinophyte that has chloroplast not from the rhodoplast lineage the chloroplast surrounded two membranes and has all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred the dinophyte nucleus the endosymbiotic event that led this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary the endosymbiont was green alga containing primary chloroplast making secondary chromatophores while most chloroplasts originate from that first set endosymbiotic paulinella chromatophora which has acquired photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more not clear whether that symbiont closely related the ancestral chloroplast other being the early stages paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts paulinella cells contain one two sausage shaped green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores descended from the cyanobacterium synechococcus chromatophores cannot survive outside their chromatophore dna about million base pairs long containing around protein encoding genes far less than the three million base pair synechococcus genome but much larger than the approximately base pair genome the more assimilated chromatophores have transferred much less their dna the nucleus their about the nuclear dna paulinella from the compared with from the chloroplast kleptoplastidy some groups mixotrophic protists like some dinoflagellates chloroplasts are separated from captured alga diatom and used these klepto chloroplasts may only have lifetime few days and are then chloroplast dna chloroplast dna list sequenced plastomes chloroplasts have their own dna often abbreviated ctdna cpdna also known the plastome its existence was first proved and first sequenced when two japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast dna liverwort and tobacco since hundreds chloroplast dnas from various species have been sequenced but mostly those land plants and

nicotiana tabacum image chloroplast dna nicotiana tabacum dna introns with few most chloroplasts have their entire chloroplast genome combined into single large ring typically base pairs long they can have contour length around micrometers and have mass about million daltons while usually thought circular there some evidence that chloroplast dna molecules more often take linear shape inverted repeats many chloroplast dnas contain two inverted repeats which separate long single copy section from short single copy section while given pair inverted repeats are rarely completely they are always very similar each apparently resulting from concerted evolution the inverted repeats vary wildly ranging from base pairs long each and containing few four many over genes inverted repeats plants tend the upper end this each being base pairs the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land and accumulate few similar inverted repeats exist the genomes cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages glaucophyta and rhodophyce suggesting that they predate the though some chloroplast dnas have since lost flipped the inverted repeats making them direct possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest the chloroplast chloroplast dnas which have lost some the inverted repeat segments tend get rearranged nucleoids new chloroplasts may contain copies their though the number chloroplast dna copies decreases about the chloroplasts they are usually packed into nucleoids which can contain several identical chloroplast dna many nucleoids can found each primitive red algae the chloroplast dna nucleoids are clustered the center the while green plants and green algae the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma though chloroplast dna not associated with true histones red algae similar proteins that tightly pack each chloroplast dna ring into nucleoid have been dna replication this section adding august gene content and protein synthesis the chloroplast genome most commonly includes around genes which code for variety mostly with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis prokaryotes genes chloroplast dna are organized into operons interestingly unlike prokaryotic dna chloroplast dna molecules contain introns plant mitochondrial dnas but not human among land the contents the chloroplast genome are fairly chloroplast genome reduction and gene transfer over many parts the chloroplast genome were transferred the nuclear genome the process called endosymbiotic gene transfer the chloroplast genome heavily reduced compared that living chloroplasts may contain genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than genes their endosymbiotic gene transfer how know about the lost chloroplasts many chromalveolate lineages even chloroplast eventually the genes donated the former nucleus providing evidence for the lost for while diatoms heterokontophyte now have red algal derived chloroplast the presence many green algal genes the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor probably the ancestor all chromalveolates had green algal derived chloroplast some which was subsequently replaced the red land some the dna their nuclei can traced back the arabidopsis corresponding about protein coding there have been few recent transfers genes from the chloroplast dna the nuclear genome land the approximately thousand proteins found some them are encoded nuclear many the protein complexes consist subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the nuclear protein synthesis must coordinated between the chloroplast and the the chloroplast mostly under nuclear though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating gene expression the called retrograde signaling protein synthesis transcription translation protein synthesis within chloroplasts relies two rna polymerases one coded the chloroplast the other nuclear origin the two rna polymerases may recognize and bind different kinds promoters within the chloroplast the ribosomes chloroplasts are similar bacterial this section requires expansion with genome size differences between algae and land chloroplast stuff coded the january protein targeting and import translation because many chloroplast genes have been moved the many proteins that would originally have been translated the chloroplast are now synthesized the cytoplasm the plant these proteins must directed back the and imported through least two chloroplast curiously around half the protein products transferred genes even targeted back the many became exaptations taking new functions like participating cell division protein routing and even disease resistance few chloroplast genes found new homes the mitochondrial genome most became nonfunctional pseudogenes though few trna genes still work the mitochondrion some transferred chloroplast dna protein products get directed the secretory pathway though should noted that many secondary plastids are bounded outermost membrane derived from the cell membrane and therefore topologically outside the because reach the chloroplast from the cytosol you have cross the cell membrane just like you were headed for the extracellular space those chloroplast targeted proteins initially travel along the secretory because the cell acquiring chloroplast already had mitochondria and peroxisomes and cell membrane for the new chloroplast host had develop unique protein targeting system avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent the wrong organelle and the wrong proteins being sent the terminus amino end terminus carboxyl end polypeptide amino acids terminus amino terminus carboxyl group but not all nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins are translated with cleavable transit peptide that added the terminus the protein sometimes the transit sequence found the terminus the within the functional part the transport proteins and membrane translocons after chloroplast polypeptide synthesized ribosome the cytosol enzyme specific chloroplast proteins phosphorylates adds phosphate group many but not them their transit phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the keeping from folding prematurely this important because prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions the wrong the cytosol the same they have keep just enough shape that they can recognized the these proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the from chloroplast proteins bound for the stroma must pass through two protein the toc complex ranslocon the uter hloroplast membrane and the tic translocon ranslocon the nner hloroplast membrane translocon chloroplast polypeptide chains probably often travel through the two complexes the same but the tic complex can also retrieve preproteins lost the intermembrane space structure transmission electron microscope thylakoids land plants chloroplasts are generally diameter and greater diversity chloroplast shapes exists among the algae which often contain single chloroplast that can shaped like net oedogonium cup chlamydomonas like spiral around the edges the cell spirogyra slightly twisted bands the cell edges sirogonium some algae have two chloroplasts each they are shaped zygnema may follow the shape half the cell order desmidiales some the chloroplast takes most the with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles for example some species chlorella have shaped chloroplast that occupies much the all chloroplasts have least three membrane the outer chloroplast the inner chloroplast and the thylakoid

thylakoids stroma nucleoid dna ribosome plastoglobulus starch granule source image chloroplast ultrastructure interactive stroma chloroplast membrane there are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast the fact that chloroplasts are surrounded double membrane often cited evidence that they are the descendants endosymbiotic cyanobacteria this often interpreted meaning the outer chloroplast membrane the product the cell membrane infolding form vesicle surround the ancestral cyanobacterium which not both chloroplast membranes are homologous the original double the chloroplast double membrane also often compared the mitochondrial double this not valid the inner mitochondria membrane used run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across generate atp energy the only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous the internal thylakoid even terms the direction chloroplast ion flow the opposite direction compared oxidative phosphorylation terms the inner chloroplast which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some has counterpart the outer chloroplast membrane chloroplast membrane the outer chloroplast membrane porous membrane that small molecules and ions can easily diffuse however not permeable larger proteins chloroplast polypeptides being synthesized the cell cytoplasm must transported across the outer chloroplast membrane the toc complex ranslocon the uter hloroplast membrane the chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the forming stromule strom containing tub ule stromules are very rare and are much more common other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts petals and respectively they may exist increase the surface area for membrane because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum they were once thought connect chloroplasts allowing them exchange however recent research strongly refutes this observed stromules are probably just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions dividing chloroplasts intermembrane space and peptidoglycan wall glaucophyte algae peptidoglycan wall thin intermembrane space about nanometers thick exists between the outer and inner chloroplast glaucophyte algal chloroplasts have peptidoglycan layer between the chloroplast corresponds the peptidoglycan cell wall their cyanobacterial ancestors which located between their two cell these chloroplasts are called muroplasts from latin mura meaning wall other chloroplasts have lost the cyanobacterial leaving intermembrane space between the two chloroplast envelope inner

the original cyanobacterium nucleoids chloroplast dna chloroplast ribosomes the thylakoid system with plastoglobuli starch granules and many proteins can found floating around the calvin cycle which fixes into sugar takes place the chloroplast ribosomes chloroplast ribosomes chloroplasts have their own which they use synthesize small fraction their chloroplast ribosomes are about thirds the size cytoplasmic ribosomes around they take mrnas transcribed from the chloroplast dna and translate them into while similar bacterial ribosomes chloroplast translation more complex than chloroplast ribosomes include some unique plastoglobuli plastoglobuli singular plastoglobulus sometimes spelled plastoglobule are spherical bubbles lipids and proteins about nanometers they are surrounded lipid monolayer plastoglobuli are found all but become more common when the chloroplast under oxidative stress when ages and transitions into gerontoplast plastoglobuli also exhibit greater size variation under these they are also common etioplasts but decrease number the etioplasts mature into plastoglubuli contain both structural proteins and enzymes involved lipid synthesis and metabolism they contain many types lipids including plastoquinone vitamin carotenoids and chlorophylls plastoglobuli were once thought floating the stroma but now thought that they are permanently attached either thylakoid another plastoglobulus attached configuration that allows plastoglobulus exchange its contents with the thylakoid normal green the vast majority plastoglobuli occur attached directly their parent old stressed plastoglobuli tend occur linked groups still always anchored plastoglobuli form when bubble appears between the layers the lipid bilayer the thylakoid bud from existing though they never detach and float off into the practically all plastoglobuli form near the highly curved edges the thylakoid disks they are also more common stromal thylakoids than granal ones starch granules starch granules are very common typically taking the though some other plastids like amyloplasts they can big enough distort the shape the starch granules are simply accumulations starch the and are not bounded starch granules appear and grow throughout the the chloroplast synthesizes sugars and are consumed night fuel respiration and continue sugar export into the phloem though mature rare for starch granule completely consumed for new granule starch granules vary composition and location across different chloroplast red algae starch granules are found the cytoplasm rather than the plants mesophyll chloroplasts which not synthesize lack starch rubisco rubisco filling model carbon fixation rubisco the chloroplast stroma contains many though the most common and important rubisco which probably also the most abundant protein the rubisco the enzyme that fixes into sugar plants rubisco abundant all though plants confined the bundle sheath chloroplasts where the calvin cycle carried out plants pyrenoids pyrenoid the chloroplasts some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids they are not found higher pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are site starch accumulation plants that contain they consist matrix opaque surrounded two hemispherical starch the starch accumulated the pyrenoids algae with carbon concentrating mechanisms the enzyme rubisco found the starch can also accumulate around the pyrenoids when pyrenoids can divide form new produced thylakoid system transmission electron microscope thylakoid suspended within the chloroplast stroma the thylakoid system highly dynamic collection membranous sacks called thylakoids where chlorophyll found and the light reactions photosynthesis happen most vascular plant chloroplasts the thylakoids are arranged stacks called though certain plant chloroplasts and some algal chloroplasts the thylakoids are free granal structure using light microscope just barely possible see tiny green which were named grana with electron microscopy became possible see the thylakoid system more revealing consist stacks flat thylakoids which made the and long interconnecting stromal thylakoids which linked different the transmission electron microscope thylakoid membranes appear alternating dark nanometers for long the dimensional structure the thylakoid system has been unknown one model has the granum stack thylakoids linked helical stromal the other has the granum single folded thylakoid connected hub and way other grana stromal while the thylakoid system still commonly depicted according the folded thylakoid was determined that the stacked and helical thylakoids model granum structure granal thylakoids stromal image labels the helical thylakoid grana consist stack flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble each granum can contain anywhere from two hundred though grana with thylakoids are most wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal also known frets lamellar thylakoids the helices ascend angle connecting each granal thylakoid like slit the helicoids may extend large sheets that link multiple narrow like bridges between while different parts the thylakoid system contain different membrane the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form single continuous thylakoids thylakoids sometimes spelled thylako are small interconnected sacks which contain the membranes that the light reactions photosynthesis take place the word thylakoid comes from the greek word thylakos which means sack embedded the thylakoid membranes are important protein complexes which carry out the light reactions photosynthesis photosystem and photosystem contain light harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use energize molecules the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid decreasing the and turning atp synthase large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient the hydrogen ions the thylakoid space generate atp energy the hydrogen ions flow back out into the much like dam there are two types granal which are arranged and stromal which are contact with the stroma granal thylakoids are shaped circular disks about nanometers stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around the flat tops and bottoms granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem protein this allows them stack forming grana with many layers tightly appressed called granal increasing stability and surface area for light photosystem and atp synthase are large protein complexes which jut out into the they fit the appressed granal and are found the stromal thylakoid the edges the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal these large protein complexes may act spacers between the sheets stromal the number thylakoids and the total thylakoid area chloroplast influenced light shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more grana with more thylakoid membrane area than chloroplasts exposed bright which have smaller and fewer grana and less thylakoid thylakoid extent can change within minutes light exposure pigments and chloroplast colors inside the photosystems embedded chloroplast thylakoid membranes are various photosynthetic pigments which absorb and transfer light energy the types pigments found are different various groups and are responsible for wide variety chloroplast paper tography spinach xanthophylls chlorophyll chlorophyll chlorophylls chlorophyll found all well their cyanobacterial ancestors chlorophyll blue green pigment partially responsible for giving most cyanobacteria and chloroplasts their other forms chlorophyll such the accessory pigments chlorophyll chlorophyll chlorophyll and chlorophyll chlorophyll olive green pigment found only the chloroplasts plants green algae any secondary chloroplasts obtained through the secondary endosymbiosis green and few cyanobacteria the chlorophylls and together that make most plant and green algal chloroplasts chlorophyll mainly found secondary endosymbiotic chloroplasts that originated from red alga although not found chloroplasts red algae chlorophyll also found some green algae and cyanobacteria chlorophylls and are pigments found only some carotenoids delesseria sanguinea red alga phycoerytherin chlorophyll addition chlorophylls another group yellow orange pigments called carotenoids are also found the there are about thirty photosynthetic they help transfer and dissipate excess and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll like during the fall when the leaves some land plants change carotene bright orange carotenoid found nearly all like chlorophyll xanthophylls especially the red zeaxanthin are also many other forms carotenoids exist that are only found certain groups phycobilins phycobilins are third group pigments found cyanobacteria and glaucophyte red algal and cryptophyte chloroplasts phycobilins come all though phycoerytherin one the pigments that makes many red algae phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about nanometers across called phycobilisomes like photosystem and atp synthase phycobilisomes jut into the preventing thylakoid stacking red algal cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria have their phycobilin pigments organized into and keep them their thylakoid space photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll chlorophyll and xanthophylls carotene carotene phycobilins land plants green algae euglenophytes chlorarachniophytes multicellular red algae unicellular red algae haptophytes dinophytes cryptophytes glaucophytes cyanobacteria specialized chloroplasts plants plants mesophyll cells bundle sheath cells leaf veins photosynthesis photosynthesis photosynthesis fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules the process photosynthesis chloroplasts use enzyme called rubisco rubisco has has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen high oxygen rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen sugar this has the end result atp energy being wasted and being all with sugar being this big since produced the initial light reactions causing issues down the line the calvin cycle which uses plants evolved way solve spatially separating the light reactions and the calvin the light which store light energy atp and nadph are done the mesophyll cells leaf the calvin which uses the stored energy make sugar using done the bundle sheath cells layer cells surrounding vein leaf chloroplasts mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage mesophyll chloroplasts are specialized for the light they lack rubisco and have normal grana and thylakoids which they use make atp and well they store carbon which why the process called photosynthesis the carbon compound then transported the bundle sheath where drops off and returns the bundle sheath chloroplasts not carry out the light preventing oxygen from building them and disrupting rubisco because they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have floating thylakoids the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow driven method synthesizing atp power the calvin cycle without generating they lack photosystem and only have photosystem the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron because the job bundle sheath chloroplasts carry out the calvin cycle and make they often contain large starch grains both types chloroplast contain large amounts chloroplast peripheral reticulum which they use get more surface area transport stuff and out mesophyll chloroplasts have little more peripheral reticulum than bundle sheath location distribution plant not all cells multicellular plant contain all green parts plant contain the more the chlorophyll them are what make the photosynthetic parts plant the plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells though chloroplasts can also found collenchyma tissue plant cell which contains chloroplasts known chlorenchyma cell typical chlorenchyma cell land plant contains about chloroplasts mesophyll some plants such cacti chloroplasts are found the stems though most chloroplasts are concentrated the leaves one square millimeter leaf tissue can contain half million within chloroplasts are mainly found the mesophyll layers leaf and the guard cells stomata palisade mesophyll cells can contain chloroplasts per while stomatal guard cells contain only around per well much less chlorophyll chloroplasts can also found the bundle sheath cells especially plants which carry out the calvin cycle their bundle sheath they are often absent from the epidermis cellular location chloroplast movement anticlinal cell walls periclinal walls cytoplasmic streaming the chloroplasts plant and algal cells can orient themselves best suit the available light they will spread out maximizing the surface area absorb under intense they will seek shelter aligning vertical columns along the plant cell wall turning sideways that light strikes them this reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage this ability distribute chloroplasts that they can take shelter behind each other spread out may the reason why land plants evolved have many small chloroplasts instead few big chloroplast movement considered one the most closely regulated response systems that can found mitochondria have also been observed follow chloroplasts they higher chloroplast movement run phototropins blue light photoreceptors also responsible for plant phototropism some mosses ferns and flowering plants chloroplast movement influenced red light addition blue though very long red wavelengths inhibit movement rather than speeding blue light generally causes chloroplasts seek while red light draws them out maximize light studies vallisneria gigantea aquatic flowering plant have shown that chloroplasts can get moving within five minutes light though they initially show any net they may move along microfilament tracks and the fact that the microfilament mesh changes shape form honeycomb structure surrounding the chloroplasts after they have moved suggests that microfilaments may help anchor chloroplasts function and chemistry guard cell chloroplasts this section requires expansion with determined controversial characteristics and august unlike most epidermal the guard cells plant stomata contain relatively well developed however exactly what they plant innate immunity plants lack specialized immune cells all plant cells participate the plant immune response chloroplasts along with the nucleus cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum are key players pathogen defense due its role plant immune pathogens frequently target the plants have two main immune the hypersensitive response which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death and systemic acquired resistance where infected cells release signals warning the rest the plant chloroplasts stimulate both responses purposely damaging their photosynthetic producing reactive oxygen species high levels reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response the reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the lower levels reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance triggering molecule production the rest the some chloroplasts are known move closer the infection site and the nucleus during chloroplasts can serve cellular after detecting stress which might due chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid jasmonic acid nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve cellular reactive oxygen species are unstable they probably leave the but instead pass their signal unknown second messenger all these molecules initiate retrograde signaling signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression the addition defense chloroplasts with the help the peroxisomes help synthesize important defense jasmonate chloroplasts synthesize all the fatty acids plant cell linoleic acid fatty precursor photosynthesis photosynthesis one the main functions the chloroplast its role photosynthesis the process which light transformed into chemical subsequently produce food the form sugars water and carbon dioxide are used and sugar and oxygen using light energy photosynthesis divided into two the light reactions where water split produce and the dark reactions calvin cycle which builds sugar molecules from carbon the two phases are linked the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp light reactions light reactions thylakoid light reactions the light reactions take place the thylakoid they take light energy and store nadph form nadp and atp fuel the dark reactions energy carriers adenosine triphosphate nadph atp the phosphorylated version adenosine diphosphate which stores energy cell and powers most cellular atp the energized while adp the depleted nadp electron carrier which ferries high energy the light gets reduced meaning picks becoming nadph photophosphorylation photophosphorylation like chloroplasts use the potential energy stored hydrogen ion gradient generate atp the two photosystems capture light energy energize electrons taken from water and release them down electron transport chain the molecules between the photosystems harness the energy pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid creating concentration gradient with more hydrogen ions thousand times inside the thylakoid system than the the hydrogen ions the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration flowing back out into the stroma through atp synthase atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate because chloroplast atp synthase projects out into the the atp synthesized position used the dark nadp reduction redox reaction electrons are often removed from the electron transport chains charge nadp with reducing nadph like atp ferredoxin nadp reductase the enzyme that reduces nadp releases the nadph makes into the right where needed for the dark because nadp reduction removes electrons from the electron transport they must the job photosystem which splits water molecules obtain the electrons from its hydrogen atoms cyclic photophosphorylation cyclic photophosphorylation while photosystem photolyzes water obtain and energize new photosystem simply reenergizes depleted electrons the end electron transport normally the reenergized electrons are taken nadp though sometimes they can flow back down more pumping electron transport chains transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space generate more this termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are cyclic photophosphorylation common plants which need more atp than nadph dark reactions the calvin cycle interactive calvin cycle rubisco carbon fixation reduction phosphoglycerate phosphoglycerate carbon dioxide biphosphoglycerate phosphate inorganic phosphate ribulose phosphate bisphosphate source image dark reactions the calvin cycle also known the dark reactions series biochemical reactions that fixes into sugar molecules and uses the energy and electrons from the atp and nadph made the light the calvin cycle takes place the stroma the while named the dark most they take place the since the dark reactions are dependent the products the light carbon fixation and synthesis the calvin cycle starts using the enzyme rubisco fix into carbon ribulose bisphosphate molecules the result unstable carbon molecules that immediately break down into carbon molecules called phosphoglyceric acid the atp and nadph made the light reactions used convert the pga into glyceraldehyde phosphate sugar most the molecules are recycled back into rubp using energy from more but one out every six produced leaves the the end product the dark sugars and starches glyceraldehyde phosphate can double form larger sugar molecules like glucose and fructose these molecules are and from the still larger sucrose disaccharide commonly known table though this process takes place outside the the cytoplasm glucose fructose glucose monomers the chloroplast can linked together make starch which accumulates into the starch grains found the under conditions such high atmospheric concentrations these starch grains may grow very distorting the grana and the starch granules displace the but leave them waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup the possibly due less sucrose being exported out the chloroplast more the plant cell this depletes free phosphate supply which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch while linked low photosynthesis the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency and might simply side effect another depressing photorespiration photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration too rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very can accidentally add instead rubp this process reduces the efficiency consumes atp and releases and produces can waste half the carbon fixed the calvin several mechanisms have evolved different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative oxygen within the increasing the efficiency these mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms these include crassulacean acid metabolism carbon fixation and pyrenoids chloroplasts plants are notable they exhibit distinct chloroplast dimorphism because the gradient across the thylakoid the interior the thylakoid acidic with around while the stroma slightly with around the optimal stroma for the calvin cycle with the reaction nearly stopping when the falls below water can form carbonic acid which can disturb the isolated interfering with even though used however chloroplasts living plant cells are not affected this chloroplasts can pump and ions and out themselves using poorly understood driven transport the presence the the thylakoid lumen can drop while the the stroma can rise nearly one amino acid synthesis chloroplasts alone make almost all plant amino acids their stroma except the sulfur containing ones like cysteine and methionine cysteine made the chloroplast the proplastid too but also synthesized the cytosol and mitochondria probably because has trouble crossing membranes get where the chloroplast known make the precursors methionine but unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg the pathway happens the cytosol other nitrogen compounds chloroplasts make all purines and pyrimidines the nitrogenous bases found dna and rna they also convert nitrite into ammonia which supplies the plant with nitrogen make its amino acids and nucleotides other chemical products this section requires expansion with needs more about also march chloroplasts are the site complex lipid metabolism differentiation replication and inheritance plastid plastid types interactive chloroplasts are special type plant cell organelle called plastid though the two terms are sometimes used there are many other types which carry out various all chloroplasts plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found the zygote fertilized proplastids are commonly found adult apical meristems chloroplasts not normally develop from proplastids root tip meristems the formation storing amyloplasts more shoots proplastids from shoot apical meristems can gradually develop into chloroplasts photosynthetic leaf tissues the leaf exposed the required this process involves invaginations the inner plastid forming sheets membrane that project into the internal stroma these membrane sheets then fold form thylakoids and grana angiosperm shoots are not exposed the required light for chloroplast proplastids may develop into etioplast stage before becoming etioplast plastid that lacks chlorophyll and has inner membrane invaginations that form lattice tubes their called prolamellar body while etioplasts lack they have yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked within few minutes light the prolamellar body begins reorganize into stacks and chlorophyll starts this where the etioplast becomes takes several gymnosperms not require light form light however does not guarantee that proplastid will develop into whether proplastid develops into chloroplast some other kind plastid mostly controlled the nucleus and largely influenced the kind cell resides plastid interconversion plastid differentiation not fact many interconversions are chloroplasts may converted chromoplasts which are pigment filled plastids responsible for the bright colors you see flowers and ripe fruit starch storing amyloplasts can also converted and possible for proplastids develop straight into chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become like what happens when you illuminate carrot potato plant something else causes plant cell revert meristematic state chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into chloroplast amyloplast chromoplast proplast etc are not absolute intermediate forms are chloroplast division this section requires expansion with functions ring dynamic regulators such giant chloroplast february most chloroplasts photosynthetic cell not develop directly from proplastids typical shoot meristematic plant cell contains only proplastids these proplastids differentiate into which divide create the chloroplasts found mature photosynthetic plant the cell divides chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts partition between the two daughter celled algae chloroplast division the only way new chloroplasts are there proplastid when algal cell its chloroplast divides along with and each daughter cell receives mature almost all chloroplasts cell rather than small group rapidly dividing chloroplasts have definite phase their dna replication not synchronized limited that their host much what know about chloroplast division comes from studying organisms like arabidopsis and the red alga cyanidioschyzon algae picture the division process starts when the proteins ftsz and ftsz assemble into and with the help protein arc form structure called ring within the the min system manages the placement the ensuring that the chloroplast cleaved more less the protein mind prevents ftsz from linking and forming another protein arc may also but not very well these proteins are active the poles the preventing ring formation but near the center the mine inhibits allowing the ring next the two plastid dividing rings rings the inner dividing ring located the inner side the inner and formed the outer dividing ring found wrapped around the outer chloroplast consists filaments about nanometers arranged rows nanometers and shrinks squeeze the this when chloroplast constriction few species like cyanidioschyzon chloroplasts have third dividing ring located the intermembrane late into the constriction dynamin proteins assemble around the outer dividing helping provide force squeeze the meanwhile the ring and the inner dividing ring break during this the many chloroplast dna plasmids floating around the stroma are partitioned and distributed the two forming daughter later the dynamins migrate under the outer plastid dividing into direct contact with the outer cleave the chloroplast two daughter remnant the outer plastid dividing ring remains floating between the two daughter and remnant the dynamin ring remains attached one the daughter the five six rings involved chloroplast only the outer dividing ring present for the entire constriction and division while the ring forms constriction does not begin until the outer dividing ring image labels chloroplast division light micrograph moss regulation species algae which contain single regulation chloroplast division extremely important ensure that each daughter cell receives chloroplasts made from organisms like whose cells contain multiple coordination looser and less likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat though the mechanisms for are mostly light has been shown requirement for chloroplast chloroplasts can grow and progress through some the constriction stages under poor quality green light but are slow complete they require exposure bright white light complete spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed contain many large shaped exposure white light can stimulate these chloroplasts divide and reduce the population shaped chloroplast inheritance like mitochondria chloroplasts are usually inherited from single biparental chloroplast where plastid genes are inherited from both parent occurs very low levels some flowering many mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast dna inheritance including selective destruction chloroplasts their genes within the gamete zygote and chloroplasts from one parent being excluded from the parental chloroplasts can sorted that only one type present each gymnosperms such pine trees mostly pass chloroplasts while flowering plants often inherit chloroplasts flowering plants were once thought only inherit chloroplasts however there are now many documented cases angiosperms inheriting chloroplasts angiosperms which pass chloroplasts maternally have many ways prevent paternal most them produce sperm cells which not contain any there are many other documented mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance these flowering such different rates chloroplast replication within the among paternal chloroplast inheritance observed more often hybrids than offspring from parents the same this suggests that incompatible hybrid genes might interfere with the mechanisms that prevent paternal transplastomic plants recently chloroplasts have caught attention developers genetically modified crops since most flowering chloroplasts are not inherited from the male transgenes these plastids cannot disseminated pollen this makes plastid transformation valuable tool for the creation and cultivation genetically modified plants that are biologically thus posing significantly lower environmental this biological containment strategy therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence conventional and organic agriculture while the reliability this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop recent results tobacco plants are showing failed containment rate transplastomic plants
