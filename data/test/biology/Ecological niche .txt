biology	ecological niche navigation search flightless dung beetle ecology niche cane term with variety meanings related the behavior species living under specific environmental the ecological niche describes how organism population responds the distribution resources and competitors for growing when resources are and when predators parasites and pathogens are and how turn alters those same factors for limiting access resources other acting food source for predators and consumer the type and number variables comprising the dimensions environmental niche vary from one species the relative importance particular environmental variables for species may vary according the geographic and biotic the notion ecological niche central ecological biogeography which focuses spatial patterns ecological species distributions and their dynamics over time result from properties the environmental and interactions between the two particular the abilities some especially our modify their environments and alter the range dynamics many other alteration ecological niche its inhabitants the topic niche construction the majority species exist standard ecological but there are premier example standard niche filling species the ground dwelling kiwi bird new which feeds worms and other ground and lives its life mammal island biogeography can help explain island species and associated unfilled contents grinnellian niche eltonian niche hutchinsonian niche parameters see also references external links grinnellian niche the ecological meaning niche comes from the meaning niche recess wall for which itself probably derived from the middle french word nicher meaning nest the term was coined the naturalist joseph grinnell his paper the niche relationships the california the grinnellian niche concept embodies the idea that the niche species determined the habitat which lives and its accompanying behavioral adaptations other the niche the sum the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow species persist and produce for the behavior the california thrasher consistent with the chaparral habitat lives breeds and feeds the underbrush and escapes from its predators shuffling from underbrush its defined the felicitous complementing the behavior and physical traits camouflaging short strong with this this perspective niche allows for the existence both ecological equivalents and empty ecological equivalent organism organism from different taxonomic group exhibiting similar adaptations similar example being the different succulents found american and african cactus and euphorbia another the anolis lizards the greater antilles are rare example convergent evolution adaptive radiation and the existence ecological the anolis lizards evolved similar microhabitats independently each other and resulted the same ecomorphs across all four eltonian niche charles sutherland elton british ecologist defined niche the animal means its place the biotic its relations food and enemies elton classified niches according foraging activities food for instance there the niche that filled birds prey which eat small animals such shrews and oak wood this niche filled tawny while the open grassland occupied the existence this carnivore niche dependent the further fact that mice form definite herbivore niche many different although the actual species mice may quite hutchinsonian niche bill throated carib the hutchinsonian niche dimensional hypervolume where the dimensions are environmental conditions and that define the requirements individual species practice its way more for its population the hypervolume defines the dimensional space resources light nutrients structure etc available and specifically used organisms and all species other than those under consideration are regarded part the coordinate the niche concept was popularized the zoologist evelyn hutchinson hutchinson wanted know why there are many types organisms any one his work inspired many others develop models explain how many and how similar coexisting species could within given and led the concepts niche the variety resources habitats used given niche resource differentiation coexisting and niche overlap resource use different statistics were introduced into the hutchinson niche robert macarthur and richard levins using the niche employing histograms describe the frequency function hutchinson for gaussian might describe the frequency with which species ate prey certain giving more detailed niche description than simply specifying some median average prey one advantage using statistics illustrated the where clear that for the narrower distributions there competition for prey between the extreme left and extreme right while for the broader distribution niche overlap indicates competition exists between all for such shaped the position width and form the niche correspond the mean standard deviation and the actual distribution organism free interference from other species could use the full range conditions biotic and and resources which could survive and reproduce which called its fundamental niche however result pressure and interactions other organisms inter specific species are usually forced occupy niche that narrower than and which they are mostly highly adapted this termed the realized niche hutchinson used the idea competition for resources the primary mechanism driving but overemphasis upon this focus has proved handicap for the niche overemphasis upon dependence upon resources has led too little emphasis upon the effects organisms their for colonization and the term adaptive zone was coined the paleontologist george gaylord simpson explain how population could jump from one niche another that suited jump adaptive made available virtue some possibly change the food chain that made the adaptive zone available without discontinuity its way life because the group was the new ecological parasitic plant mistletoe niche description the ecological space occupied subtly different from the niche defined grinnell ecological that may may not actually filled see vacant niches niche very specific segment ecospace occupied single the presumption that two species are identical all respects called axiom and the competitive exclusion principle some resource adaptive dimension will provide niche specific each species can however share mode autecological which are broader definitions for australian grasslands though different from those the great plains grasslands exhibit similar modes once niche left other organisms can fill that for the niche that was left vacant the extinction the tarpan has been filled other animals particular small horse the konik also when plants and animals are introduced
