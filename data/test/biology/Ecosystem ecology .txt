ecosystem ecology navigation search riparian forest white mountains new hampshire ecosystem ecology the integrated study living biotic and living abiotic components ecosystems and their interactions within ecosystem this science examines how ecosystems work and relates this their components such chemicals bedrock soil plants and animals ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each ultimately this helps understand how maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity major focus ecosystem ecology functional ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced these include primary productivity production biomass decomposition and trophic interactions studies ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding sustainable production forage fiber fuel and provision water functional processes are mediated local level climate disturbance and thus ecosystem ecology provides powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental especially global warming and degradation surface this example demonstrates several important aspects ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate time organisms within ecosystems are dependent ecosystem level biological and physical processes adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and biodiversity these characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource who will manage which will timber cutting the forest degrade recreational fishing the these questions are difficult for land managers address while the boundary between ecosystems remains even though decisions one ecosystem will affect the need better understanding the interactions and interdependencies these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before can begin address these ecosystem ecology inherently interdisciplinary field individual ecosystem composed populations organisms interacting within and contributing the cycling nutrients and the flow energy the ecosystem the principal unit study ecosystem population community and physiological ecology provide many the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they cycling energy and matter the ecosystem level are often examined ecosystem but this science defined more subject matter than ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools energy and nutrients integrated system which distinguishes from associated sciences such biogeochemistry biogeochemistry and hydrology focus several fundamental ecosystem processes such biologically mediated chemical cycling nutrients and biological cycling ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional global processes encompassed regional global and earth system contents history ecosystem services operation decomposition and nutrient cycling trophic dynamics applications and importance lessons from two central american cities see also references history ecosystem ecology philosophically and historically rooted terrestrial the ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last years with important ideas developed frederic clements botanist who argued for specific definitions ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and although most clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly initially henry gleason and arthur tansley and later contemporary the idea that physiological processes are fundamental ecosystem structure and function remains central later work eugene odum and howard odum quantified flows energy and matter the ecosystem thus documenting the general ideas proposed clements and his contemporary charles elton see figure this energy flows through the whole system were dependent biotic and abiotic interactions each individual component species inorganic pools etc later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied nutrient changed over the course succession and held powerful controls over ecosystem transfers energy and nutrients are innate ecological systems regardless whether they are aquatic thus ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies animals terrestrial aquatic and marine ecosystems ecosystem services ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential sustaining healthy human societies water provision and production biomass forestry agriculture and fisheries and removal greenhouse gases such carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are examples ecosystem services essential public health and economic nutrient cycling process fundamental agricultural and forest however like most ecosystem nutrient cycling not ecosystem characteristic which can the most desirable maximizing production degraded systems overly simplistic solution the complex problems hunger and economic for intensive fertilizer use the midwestern united states has resulted degraded fisheries the gulf mexico regrettably green revolution intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture developed and developing countries these strategies risk alteration ecosystem processes that may difficult especially when applied broad scales without adequate assessment ecosystem processes may take many years recover from significant for large scale forest clearance the northeastern united states during the and centuries has altered soil dominant and nutrient cycling ways that impact forest productivity the present appreciation the importance ecosystem function maintenance whether agriculture needed conjunction with plans for restoration essential improved knowledge ecosystem function will help achieve term sustainability and stability the poorest parts the operation biomass productivity one the most apparent and economically important ecosystem biomass accumulation begins the cellular level via photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patters annual biomass production are correlated with annual amounts productivity are also dependent the overall capacity plants capture sunlight which directly correlated with plant leaf area and net primary productivity the primary measure biomass accumulation within net primary productivity can calculated simple formula where the total amount productivity adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance biological where gpp gross primary productivity and photosynthate carbon lost via cellular respiration npp difficult measure but new technique known eddy variance has shed light how natural ecosystems influence the figure shows seasonal and annual changes concentration measured mauna loa hawaii from concentration steadily but year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began these variations were thought due seasonal uptake during summer newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem npp has confirmed seasonal variation are driven seasonal changes uptake this has led many scientists and policy makers speculate that ecosystems can managed ameliorate problems with global warming this type management may include reforesting altering forest harvest schedules for many parts the decomposition and nutrient cycling decomposition and nutrient cycling are fundamental ecosystem biomass most natural ecosystems are nitrogen limited and biomass production closely correlated with typically external input nutrients very low and efficient recycling nutrients maintains decomposition plant litter accounts for the majority nutrients recycled through ecosystems figure rates plant litter decomposition are highly dependent litter high concentration phenolic especially lignin plant litter has retarding effect litter more complex compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years completely decomposition typically described with exponential decay and has been related the mineral especially the leaf globally rates decomposition are mediated litter quality and ecosystems dominated plants with lignin concentration often have rapid rates decomposition and nutrient cycling chapin simple carbon containing compounds are preferentially metabolized decomposer microorganisms which results rapid initial rates see figure models that depend constant rates called values see figure however these models not reflect simultaneous linear and linear decay processes which likely occur during for proteins sugars and lipids decompose but lignin decays more linear rate thus litter decay inaccurately predicted simplistic simple alternative model presented figure shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model figure better understanding decomposition models important research area ecosystem ecology because this process closely tied nutrient supply and the overall capacity ecosystems sequester from the trophic dynamics trophic dynamics refers process energy and nutrient transfer between trophic dynamics important part the structure and function figure shows energy transferred for ecosystem silver florida energy gained primary producers consumed herbivores which are consumed carnivores which are themselves consumed carnivores one the most obvious patterns figure that one moves higher trophic levels from plants the total amount energy plants exert control the energy structure ecosystems determining the total amount energy that enters the however predators can also influence the structure lower trophic levels from the these influences can dramatically shift dominant species terrestrial and marine systems the interplay and relative strength down bottom controls ecosystem structure and function important area research the greater field trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates decomposition and nutrient cycling time and for herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes litter quality and altered dominant insect herbivory has been shown increase rates decomposition and nutrient turnover due changes litter quality and increased frass inputs however insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient stadler showed that rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result increased immobilization soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass north atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered overfishing cod stocks crashed the which resulted increases their prey such shrimp and snow crab human intervention ecosystems has resulted dramatic changes ecosystem structure and these changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human applications and importance lessons from two central american cities the biosphere has been greatly altered the demands human ecosystem ecology plays important role understanding and adapting the most pressing current environmental restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem restoring highly degraded resources depends integration functional mechanisms without these functions economic value ecosystems greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop the for areas within the mountainous western highlands guatemala are more susceptible catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due loss forest cities such totonicap that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human this situation striking considering that these areas are close each the majority inhabitants are mayan descent and the topography and overall resources are this case two groups people managing resources fundamentally different ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed avoid
