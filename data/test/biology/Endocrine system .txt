biology	endocrine system navigation search the endocrine system refers the collection glands organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system carried toward distant target the major endocrine glands include the pineal gland pituitary gland pancreas ovaries testes thyroid gland parathyroid gland hypothalamus gastrointestinal tract and adrenal glands the endocrine system contrast the exocrine system which secretes its hormones using ducts examples exocrine glands include the sweat glands salivary glands mammary glands and liver the endocrine system information signal system like the nervous yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably the endocrine effects are slow and prolonged their lasting from few hours the nervous system sends information very and responses are generally short vertebrates the hypothalamus the neural control center for all endocrine the field study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders endocrinology branch internal medicine special features endocrine glands are their ductless their and commonly the presence intracellular vacuoles granules that store their exocrine glands such salivary glands sweat glands and glands within the gastrointestinal tract tend much less vascular and have ducts hollow lumen addition the specialised endocrine organs mentioned many other organs that are part other body such the kidney liver heart and gonads have secondary endocrine for example the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such erythropoietin and renin number glands that signal each other sequence are usually referred for the hypothalamic adrenal axis opposed endocrine factors that travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory other signaling such paracrine factors involved paracrine signalling diffuse over
