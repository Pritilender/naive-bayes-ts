back some the first pre socratic greek such anaximander and empedocles such proposals survived into roman the poet and philosopher lucretius followed empedocles his masterwork rerum natura contrast these materialistic views aristotle understood all natural not only living things being imperfect actualisations different fixed natural known forms ideas latin species this was part his teleological understanding nature which all things have intended role play divine cosmic order variations this idea became the standard understanding the middle ages and were integrated into christian but aristotle did not demand that real types animals always corresponded one with exact metaphysical and specifically gave examples how new types living things could come the century the new method modern science rejected and sought explanations natural phenomena terms physical laws which were the same for all visible and did not need assume any fixed natural nor any divine cosmic but this new approach was slow take root the biological which became the last bastion the concept fixed natural john ray used one the previously more general terms for fixed natural species apply animal and plant but strictly identified each type living thing and proposed that each species can defined the features that perpetuate themselves each these species were designed but showing differences caused local the biological classification introduced carolus linnaeus also viewed species fixed according divine charles darwin the origin species other naturalists this time speculated evolutionary change species over time according natural maupertuis wrote natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations produce new buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different and erasmus darwin proposed that all blooded animals could have descended from single organism filament the first fledged evolutionary scheme was lamarck transmutation theory which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms life that developed greater complexity parallel lineages with inherent progressive and that local level these lineages adapted the environment inheriting changes caused use disuse the latter process was later called these ideas were condemned established naturalists speculation lacking empirical particular georges cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and their similarities reflecting divine design for functional the ray ideas benevolent design had been developed william paley into the natural theology evidences the existence and attributes the deity which proposed complex adaptations evidence divine and was admired charles the critical break from the concept fixed species biology began with the theory evolution natural which was formulated charles partly influenced essay the principle population thomas robert malthus darwin noted that population growth would lead struggle for where favorable variations could prevail others each many offspring fail survive age reproduction because limited this could explain the diversity animals and plants from common ancestry through the working natural laws working the same for all types darwin was developing his theory natural selection from onwards until alfred russel wallace sent him similar theory both men presented their separate papers the linnean society london the end darwin publication the origin species explained natural selection detail and way that led increasingly wide acceptance darwinian evolution thomas henry huxley applied ideas using paleontology and comparative anatomy provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared common some were disturbed this since implied that humans did not have special place the precise mechanisms reproductive heritability and the origin new traits remained towards this darwin developed his provisional theory pangenesis gregor mendel reported that traits were inherited predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation elements later known genes mendel laws inheritance eventually supplanted most pangenesis august weismann made the important distinction between germ cells sperm and and somatic cells the demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line hugo vries connected pangenesis theory soma cell distinction and proposed that pangenes were concentrated the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm change the cells vries was also one the researchers who made work believing that mendelian traits corresponded the transfer heritable variations along the explain how new variants vries developed mutation theory that led temporary rift between those who accepted darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with the turn the pioneers the field population such haldane sewall wright and ronald fisher set the foundations evolution onto robust statistical the false contradiction between genetic and mendelian inheritance was thus the and modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural mutation and mendelian inheritance into unified theory that applied generally any branch the modern synthesis was able explain patterns observed across species through fossil transitions and even complex cellular mechanisms developmental biology the publication the structure dna james watson and francis crick demonstrated physical basis for molecular biology improved our understanding the relationship between genotype and advancements were also made phylogenetic systematics mapping the transition traits into comparative and testable framework through the publication and use evolutionary trees evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky penned that nothing biology makes sense except the light because has brought light the relations what first seemed disjointed facts natural history into coherent explanatory body knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life this since the modern synthesis has been further extended explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale the biological hierarchy from genes this extension has been dubbed evo devo heredity introduction genetics genetics heredity norms reaction dna bases double helix evolution organisms occurs through changes heritable traits particular characteristics for eye colour inherited characteristic and individual might inherit the eye from one their inherited traits are controlled genes and the complete set genes within genome called its genotype the complete set observable traits that make the structure and behaviour organism called its phenotype these traits come from the interaction its genotype with the environment many aspects phenotype are not for suntanned skin comes from the interaction between genotype and thus suntans are not passed however some people tan more easily than due differences their striking example are people with the inherited trait albinism who not tan all and are very sensitive sunburn heritable traits are passed from one generation the next via dna molecule that encodes genetic dna long polymer composed four types the sequence bases along particular dna molecule specify the genetic manner similar sequence letters spelling out before cell the dna that each the resulting two cells will inherit the dna portions dna molecule that specify single functional unit are called genes different genes have different sequences within cells the long strands dna form condensed structures called chromosomes the specific location dna sequence within chromosome known locus the dna sequence locus varies between the different forms this sequence are called alleles dna sequences can change through mutations producing new mutation occurs within the new allele may affect the trait that the gene altering the phenotype the however while this simple correspondence between allele and trait works some most traits are more complex and are controlled multiple interacting genes recent findings have confirmed important examples heritable changes that cannot explained changes the sequence nucleotides the these phenomena are classed epigenetic inheritance dna methylation marking chromatin self sustaining metabolic gene silencing rna interference and the dimensional conformation proteins such prions are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered the organismic developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions genetic networks and communication among cells can lead heritable variations that may underlay some the mechanics developmental plasticity and canalization heritability may also occur even larger for ecological inheritance through the process niche construction defined the regular and repeated activities organisms their this generates legacy effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime subsequent descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated the ecological actions other examples heritability evolution that are not under the direct control genes include the inheritance cultural traits and symbiogenesis variation peppered moth peppered moth evolution genetic diversity population genetics individual phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment has lived substantial part the variation phenotypes population caused the differences between their the modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution the change over time this genetic the frequency one particular allele will become more less prevalent relative other forms that variation disappears when new allele reaches the point fixation when either disappears from the population replaces the ancestral allele natural selection will only cause evolution there enough genetic variation before the discovery mendelian genetics one common hypothesis was blending inheritance but with blending genetic variance would rapidly making evolution natural selection the hardy weinberg principle provides the solution how variation maintained population with mendelian inheritance the frequencies alleles variations will remain constant the absence mutation migration and genetic variation comes from mutations genetic material reshuffling genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations gene flow despite the constant introduction new variation through mutation and gene most the genome species identical all individuals that however even relatively small differences genotype can lead dramatic differences for chimpanzees and humans differ only about their mutation mutation chromosome mutations are changes the dna sequence when mutations they can either have alter the product gene prevent the gene from based studies the fly drosophila melanogaster has been suggested that mutation changes protein produced this will probably with about these mutations having damaging and the remainder being either neutral weakly mutations can involve large sections chromosome becoming duplicated usually genetic recombination which can introduce extra copies gene into extra copies genes are major source the raw material needed for new genes this important because most new genes evolve within gene families from existing genes that share common for the human eye uses four genes make structures that sense three for colour vision and one for night vision all four are descended from single ancestral new genes can generated from ancestral gene when duplicate copy mutates and acquires new this process easier once gene has been duplicated because increases the redundancy the one gene the pair can acquire new function while the other copy continues perform its original other types mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding the generation new genes can also involve small parts several genes being with these fragments then recombining form new combinations with new when new genes are assembled from shuffling existing domains act modules with simple independent which can mixed together produce new combinations with new and complex for polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make they contain one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step the overall like step assembly sex and recombination sexual reproduction genetic recombination evolution sexual reproduction asexual genes are inherited linked they cannot mix with genes other organisms during the offspring sexual organisms contain random mixtures their chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment related process called homologous recombination sexual organisms exchange dna between two matching recombination and reassortment not alter allele but instead change which alleles are associated with each producing offspring with new combinations sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate gene flow gene flow gene flow the exchange genes between populations and between can therefore source variation that new population gene flow can caused the movement individuals between separate populations might caused the movement mice between inland and coastal the movement pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations gene transfer between species includes the formation hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer horizontal gene transfer the transfer genetic material from one organism another organism that not its this most common among bacteria this contributes the spread antibiotic resistance when one bacteria acquires resistance genes can rapidly transfer them other horizontal transfer genes from bacteria eukaryotes such the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean beetle callosobruchus chinensis has example scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers which have received range genes from fungi and viruses can also carry dna between allowing transfer genes even across biological domains large scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors eukaryotic cells and bacteria during the acquisition chloroplasts and mitochondria possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea mechanisms mutation natural selection from neo darwinian perspective evolution occurs when there are changes the frequencies alleles within population interbreeding for the allele for black colour population moths becoming more mechanisms that can lead changes allele frequencies include natural selection genetic drift genetic hitchhiking mutation and gene flow natural selection natural selection fitness evolution means natural selection the process which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become and remain more common successive generations has often been called mechanism because necessarily follows from three simple heritable variation exists within populations organisms produce more progeny than can these offspring vary their ability survive and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and consequently organisms with traits that give them advantage over their competitors are more likely pass their traits the next generation than those with traits that not confer the central concept natural selection the evolutionary fitness fitness measured ability survive and which determines the size its genetic contribution the next however fitness not the same the total number instead fitness indicated the proportion subsequent generations that carry for organism could survive well and reproduce but its offspring were all too small and weak this organism would make little genetic contribution future generations and would thus have low allele increases fitness more than the other alleles that then with each generation this allele will become more common within the these traits are said selected for examples traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity conversely the lower fitness caused having less beneficial deleterious allele results this allele becoming they are selected against importantly the fitness allele not fixed the environment previously neutral harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become however even the direction selection does reverse this traits that were lost the past may not evolve identical form see dollo law disruptive selection stabilizing selection directional selection natural selection within population for trait that can vary across range such can categorised into three different the first directional selection which shift the average value trait over for organisms slowly getting secondly disruptive selection selection for extreme trait values and often results two different values becoming most with selection against the average this would when either short tall organisms had but not those medium finally stabilizing selection there selection against extreme trait values both which causes decrease variance around the average value and less this for cause organisms slowly become all the same special case natural selection sexual selection which selection for any trait that increases mating success increasing the attractiveness organism potential traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males several animal although sexually traits such cumbersome mating large body size and bright colours often attract which compromises the survival individual this survival disadvantage balanced higher reproductive success males that show these hard fake sexually selected natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual are more less likely nature this sense refers ecosystem that system which organisms interact with every other physical well biological their local environment eugene founder defined ecosystem any unit that includes all the given area interacting with the physical environment that flow energy leads clearly defined trophic biotic diversity and material cycles exchange materials between living and nonliving within the each population within ecosystem occupies distinct niche with distinct relationships other parts the these relationships involve the life history the its position the food chain and its geographic this broad understanding nature enables scientists delineate specific forces together comprise natural natural selection can act different levels organisation such cells individual groups organisms and selection can act multiple levels example selection occurring below the level the individual organism are genes called transposons which can replicate and spread throughout genome selection level above the such group selection may allow the evolution discussed biased mutation addition being major source mutation may also function mechanism evolution when there are different probabilities the molecular level for different mutations process known mutation two for example one with the nucleotide and another with the nucleotide the same have the same but mutation from happens more often than mutation from then genotypes with will tend different insertion deletion mutation biases different taxa can lead the evolution different genome developmental mutational biases have also been observed morphological evolution for according the phenotype first theory evolution mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation traits that were previously induced the environment mutation bias effects are superimposed other selection would favor either one out two but there extra advantage having then the mutation that occurs the most frequently the one that most likely become fixed mutations leading the loss function gene are much more common than mutations that produce fully functional most loss function mutations are selected but when selection mutation bias towards loss function can affect for pigments are longer useful when animals live the darkness and tend this kind loss function can occur because mutation and because the function had and once the benefit the function natural selection leads the loss sporulation ability bacterium during laboratory evolution appears have been caused mutation rather than natural selection against the cost maintaining sporulation when there selection for loss the speed which loss evolves depends more the mutation rate than does the effective population size indicating that driven more mutation bias than genetic genetic drift genetic drift effective population size genetic drift fixation genetic drift the change allele frequency from one generation the next that occurs because alleles are subject sampling error when selective forces are absent relatively allele frequencies tend drift upward downward randomly random walk this drift halts when allele eventually becomes fixed either disappearing from the replacing the other alleles genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from population due chance even the absence selective genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets usually difficult measure the relative importance selection and neutral including the comparative importance adaptive and adaptive forces driving evolutionary change area current research the neutral theory molecular evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes are the result the fixation neutral mutations genetic hence this most genetic changes population are the result constant mutation pressure and genetic this form the neutral theory now largely since does not seem fit the genetic variation seen however more recent and supported version this model the nearly neutral theory where mutation that would neutral small population not necessarily neutral large other alternative theories propose that genetic drift dwarfed other stochastic forces such genetic hitchhiking also known genetic the time for neutral allele become fixed genetic drift depends population with fixation occurring more rapidly smaller the number individuals population not but instead measure known the effective population size the effective population usually smaller than the total population since takes into account factors such the level inbreeding and the stage the lifecycle which the population the the effective population size may not the same for every gene the same genetic hitchhiking genetic hitchhiking robertson effect selective sweep genetic drift recombination allows alleles the same strand dna become however the rate recombination low approximately two events per chromosome per genes close together chromosome may not always shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend inherited phenomenon known linkage this tendency measured finding how often two alleles occur together single chromosome compared expectations which called their linkage disequilibrium set alleles that usually inherited group called haplotype this can important when one allele particular haplotype strongly natural selection can drive selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles the haplotype become more common the this effect called genetic hitchhiking genetic genetic draft caused the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked others that are under selection can partially captured appropriate effective population gene flow gene flow hybrid horizontal gene transfer gene flow the exchange genes between populations and between the presence absence gene flow fundamentally changes the course due the complexity any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral the bateson muller model even both populations remain essentially identical terms their adaptation the genetic differentiation between populations gene flow between populations can introduce traits alleles which are disadvantageous the local population and this may lead organism within these populations evolve mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant eventually resulting the appearance new thus exchange genetic information between individuals fundamentally important for the development the biological species concept during the development the modern sewall wright developed his shifting balance theory that gene flow between partially isolated populations was important aspect adaptive however recently there has been substantial criticism the importance the shifting balance outcomes evolution influences every aspect the form and behaviour most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome natural these adaptations increase fitness aiding activities such finding avoiding predators attracting organisms can also respond selection operating with each usually aiding their relatives engaging mutually beneficial symbiosis the longer evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations organisms into new groups that cannot will not these outcomes evolution are sometimes divided into macroevolution which evolution that occurs above the level such extinction and speciation and microevolution which smaller evolutionary such within species macroevolution regarded the outcome long periods thus the distinction between and macroevolution not fundamental the difference simply the time however the traits the entire species may for large amount variation among individuals allows species rapidly adapt new lessening the chance going while wide geographic range increases the chance making more likely that part the population will become this microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection different with microevolution acting genes and versus macroevolutionary processes such species selection acting entire species and affecting their rates speciation and common misconception that evolution has goals term realistically evolution has term goal and does not necessarily produce greater although complex species have they occur side effect the overall number organisms increasing and simple forms life still remain more common the for the overwhelming majority species are microscopic prokaryotes which form about half the biomass despite their small and constitute the vast majority simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form life earth throughout its history and continue the main form life the present with complex life only appearing more diverse because more noticeable indeed the evolution microorganisms particularly important modern evolutionary research since their rapid reproduction allows the study experimental evolution and the observation evolution and adaptation real adaptation adaptation homologous tetrapods adaptation the process that makes organisms better suited their habitat also the term adaptation may refer trait that important for for the adaptation teeth the grinding using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the product the bodily part the two senses the word may adaptations are produced natural selection the following definitions are due theodosius dobzhansky adaptation the evolutionary process whereby organism becomes better able live its habitat adaptedness the state being the degree which organism able live and reproduce given set adaptive trait aspect the developmental pattern the organism which enables enhances the probability that organism surviving and adaptation may cause either the gain new the loss ancestral example that shows both types change bacterial adaptation antibiotic selection with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance both modifying the target the increasing the activity transporters that pump the drug out the other striking examples are the bacteria escherichia coli evolving the ability use citric acid nutrient long term laboratory experiment flavobacterium evolving novel enzyme that allows these bacteria grow the products nylon manufacturing and the soil bacterium sphingobium evolving entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol interesting but still controversial idea that some adaptations might increase the ability organisms generate genetic diversity and adapt natural selection increasing evolvability baleen whale flipper adapted leg vestigial adaptation occurs through the gradual modification existing consequently structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions related this the result single ancestral structure being adapted function different the bones within bat wings for are very similar those mice feet and primate hands due the descent all these structures from common mammalian however since all living organisms are related some even organs that appear have little structural such arthropod squid and vertebrate the limbs and wings arthropods and can depend common set homologous genes that control their assembly and this called deep homology during some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures such structures may have little function current yet have clear function ancestral other closely related examples include pseudogenes the functional remains eyes blind dwelling wings flightless and the presence hip bones whales and examples vestigial structures humans include wisdom teeth the coccyx the vermiform appendix and other behavioural vestiges such goose bumps and primitive reflexes however many traits that appear simple adaptations are fact exaptations structures originally adapted for one but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function the one example the african lizard holaspis guentheri which developed extremely flat head for hiding can seen looking its near however this the head has become flattened that assists gliding from tree exaptation within molecular machines such the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved the recruitment several existing proteins that previously had different another example the recruitment enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism serve structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses eyes area current investigation evolutionary developmental biology the developmental basis adaptations and this research addresses the origin and evolution embryonic development and how modifications development and developmental processes produce novel these studies have shown that evolution can alter development produce new such embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw other animals instead forming part the middle ear also possible for structures that have been lost evolution reappear due changes developmental such mutation chickens causing embryos grow teeth similar those crocodiles now becoming clear that most alterations the form organisms are due changes small set conserved evolution common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis tetrodotoxin evolution interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and when the interaction between pairs such pathogen and host predator and its these species can develop matched sets here the evolution one species causes adaptations second these changes the second species cause new adaptations the first this cycle selection and response called evolution example the production tetrodotoxin the rough skinned newt and the evolution tetrodotoxin resistance its the common garter snake this prey evolutionary arms race has produced high levels toxin the newt and correspondingly high levels toxin resistance the operation operation not all evolved interactions between species involve many cases mutually beneficial interactions have for extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow their roots and aid the plant absorbing nutrients from the this reciprocal relationship the plants provide the fungi with sugars from here the fungi actually grow inside plant allowing them exchange nutrients with their while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system coalitions between organisms the same species have also extreme case the eusociality found social insects such bees termites and ants where sterile insects feed and guard the small number organisms colony that are able even smaller the somatic cells that make the body animal limit their reproduction they can maintain stable which then supports small number the germ cells produce here somatic cells respond specific signals that instruct them whether remain they cells ignore these signals and multiply their uncontrolled growth causes cancer such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process kin selection which where one organism acts help raise this activity selected for because the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will passed other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection where cooperation provides benefits group speciation speciation speciation the process where species diverges into two more descendant there are multiple ways define the concept species the choice definition dependent the particularities the species for some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual despite the diversity various species these various concepts can placed into one three broad philosophical interbreeding ecological and the biological species concept classic example the interbreeding defined ernst mayr the bsc states that species are groups actually potentially interbreeding natural which are reproductively isolated from other such despite its wide and term the bsc like others not without for example because these concepts cannot applied and this called the species problem some researchers have attempted unifying monistic definition while others adopt pluralistic approach and suggest that there may different ways logically interpret the definition barriers reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations become new species gene flow may slow this process spreading the new genetic variants also the other depending how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor may still possible for them produce with horses and donkeys mating produce mules such hybrids are generally infertile this closely related species may regularly but hybrids will selected against and the species will remain however viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent possess totally new the importance hybridisation producing new species animals although cases have been seen many types with the gray tree frog being particularly studied speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and sexually reproducing speciation results from reproductive isolation followed genealogical there are four mechanisms for the most common animals allopatric speciation which occurs populations initially isolated such habitat fragmentation selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes the appearance and behaviour selection and drift act independently populations isolated from the rest their separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot the second mechanism speciation peripatric speciation which occurs when small populations organisms become isolated new this differs from allopatric speciation that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental here the founder effect causes rapid speciation after increase inbreeding increases selection leading rapid genetic the third mechanism speciation parapatric speciation this similar peripatric speciation that small population enters new but differs that there physical separation between these two instead speciation results from the evolution mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two generally this occurs when there has been drastic change the environment within the parental habitat one example the grass anthoxanthum odoratum which can undergo parapatric speciation response localised metal pollution from here plants evolve that have resistance high levels metals the selection against interbreeding with the sensitive parental population produced gradual change the flowering time the resistant which eventually produced complete reproductive selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement which the evolution traits that promote mating within well character displacement which when two species become more distinct geographical isolation finches pagos islands sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation changes this form rare since even small amount gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts generally sympatric speciation animals requires the evolution both genetic differences and non random mating allow reproductive isolation one type sympatric speciation involves breeding two related species produce new hybrid species this not common animals animal hybrids are usually this because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully however more common plants because plants often double their number form polyploids this allows the chromosomes from each parental species form matching pairs during since each chromosomes are represented pair example such speciation event when the plant species arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis arenosa cross bred give the new species arabidopsis suecica this happened about years and the speciation process has been repeated the which allows the study the genetic mechanisms involved this indeed chromosome doubling within species may common cause reproductive half the doubled chromosomes will unmatched when breeding with undoubled speciation events are important the theory punctuated equilibrium which accounts for the pattern the fossil record short bursts evolution interspersed with relatively long periods where species remain relatively this speciation and rapid evolution are with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly organisms undergoing speciation novel habitats small the periods stasis the fossil record correspond the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found small populations geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved extinction extinction tyrannosaurus rex avian dinosaurs paleogene extinction event cretaceous extinction the disappearance entire extinction not unusual species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through nearly all animal and plant species that have lived earth are now and extinction appears the ultimate fate all these extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history although the rate extinction spikes occasional mass extinction events the cretaceous paleogene extinction event during which the avian dinosaurs went the most but the earlier permian triassic extinction event was even more with approximately species driven the holocene extinction event ongoing mass extinction associated with expansion across the globe over the past few thousand present day extinction rates are times greater than the background rate and current species may extinct the mid human activities are now the primary cause the ongoing extinction global warming may further accelerate the the role extinction evolution not very well understood and may depend which type extinction the causes the continuous extinction which form the majority may the result competition between species for limited resources competitive exclusion one species can compete this could produce species selection with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven the intermittent mass extinctions are also but instead acting selective they drastically reduce diversity nonspecific manner and promote bursts rapid evolution and

organisms earth are descended from common ancestor ancestral gene current species are stage the process with their diversity the product long series speciation and extinction the common descent organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about first they have geographic distributions that cannot explained local second the diversity life not set completely unique but organisms that share morphological similarities third vestigial traits with clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and that organisms can classified using these similarities into hierarchy nested similar

past species have also left records their evolutionary fossils along with the comparative anatomy day constitute the record comparing the anatomies both modern and extinct paleontologists can infer the lineages those however this approach most successful for organisms that had hard body such bones further prokaryotes such bacteria and archaea share limited set common their fossils not provide
