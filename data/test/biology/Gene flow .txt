population genetics gene flow also known gene migration the transfer alleles genes from one population migration into out population may responsible for marked change allele frequencies the proportion members carrying particular variant immigration may also result the addition new genetic variants the established gene pool particular species there are number factors that affect the rate gene flow between different one the most significant factors greater mobility individual tends give greater migratory animals tend more mobile than although pollen and seeds may carried great distances animals maintained gene flow between two populations can also lead combination the two gene reducing the genetic variation between the two for this reason that gene flow strongly acts against speciation recombining the gene pools the and repairing the developing differences genetic variation that would have led full speciation and creation daughter for species grass grows both sides pollen likely transported from one side the other and vice this pollen able fertilize the plant where ends and produce viable then the alleles the pollen have effectively been able move from the population one side the highway the contents barriers gene flow gene flow humans gene flow between species genetic pollution see also references external links barriers gene flow physical barriers gene flow are but not natural they may include impassable mountain oceans vast some they can man made such the great wall china which has hindered the gene flow native plant one these native ulmus pumila demonstrated lower prevalence genetic differentiation than the plants vitex ziziphus heteropappus and prunus armeniaca whose habitat located the opposite side the great wall china where ulmus pumila grows this because ulmus pumila has pollination its primary means propagation and the plants carry out pollination through samples the same species which grow either side have been shown have developed genetic because there little gene flow provide recombination the gene barriers gene flow need not always species can live the same yet show very limited gene flow due limited hybridization hybridization yielding unfit female choice can also play role hindering gene asymmetric recognition local and nonlocal songs has been found between two populations black throated blue warblers the united one the northern united states new and the other the southern united states north males the northern population respond strongly the local male songs but relatively weakly the nonlocal songs southern southern males respond equally both local and nonlocal the fact that northern males exhibit differential recognition indicates that northern females tend not mate with males from the thus not necessary for the northern males respond strongly the song from southern barrier gene flow exists from south north result the female gene flow humans african admixture europe gene flow has been observed humans for the united states gene flow was observed between white european population and black west african which were recently brought west where malaria the duffy antigen provides some resistance the and this allele thus present nearly all the west african europeans have either the allele because malaria almost measuring the frequencies the west african and european scientists found that the allele frequencies became mixed each population because movement was also found that this gene flow between european and west african groups much greater the northern than the gene flow between species horizontal gene transfer horizontal gene transfer refers the transfer genes between organisms manner other than traditional either through hybridization antigenic shift reassortment sometimes important source genetic viruses can transfer genes between bacteria can incorporate genes from other dead exchange genes with living and can exchange plasmids across species sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries phylogenetic domains thus determining the phylogenetic history species can not done conclusively determining evolutionary trees for single biologist gogarten suggests the original metaphor tree longer fits the data from recent genome biologists instead use the metaphor mosaic describe the different histories combined individual genomes and use the metaphor intertwined net visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects horizontal gene using single genes phylogenetic markers difficult trace organismal phylogeny the presence combining the simple coalescence model cladogenesis with rare hgt events suggest there was single last common ancestor that contained all the genes ancestral those shared among the three domains life each contemporary molecule has its own history and traces back individual molecule cenancestor however these molecular ancestors were likely present different organisms different genetic pollution genetic pollution region specific species can threatened with extinction through genetic potentially causing uncontrolled hybridization introgression and genetic these processes can lead homogenization replacement local genotypes result either numerical fitness advantage introduced plant nonnative species can threaten native plants and animals with extinction hybridization and introgression either through purposeful introduction humans through habitat bringing previously isolated species into these phenomena can especially detrimental for rare species coming into contact with more abundant interbreeding between the species can cause the rarer gene creating hybrids that supplant the native the extent this phenomenon not always apparent from outward appearance alone while some degree gene flow occurs the course normal hybridization with without introgression may threaten rare existence for the mallard abundant species duck that interbreeds readily with wide range other ducks and poses threat the integrity some see also biological dispersal genetic erosion genetic admixture gene pool
