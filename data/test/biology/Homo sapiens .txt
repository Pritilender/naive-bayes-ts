homo sapiens binomial name homo sapiens linnaeus subspecies homo sapiens idaltu homo sapiens sapiens homo neanderthalensis homo rhodesiensis homo sapiens latin wise man the binomial nomenclature also known the scientific name for the human species homo the human genus which also includes neanderthals and many other extinct species hominid sapiens the only surviving species the genus homo modern humans are the subspecies homo sapiens sapiens which differentiates them from what has been argued their direct homo sapiens idaltu contents subspecies evolution evolutionary history primates references subspecies subspecies sapiens include homo sapiens idaltu and the only extant subspecies homo sapiens sapiens some sources show homo sapiens neanderthalensis subspecies sapiens similarly the discovered specimens the homo rhodesiensis species have been classified some but this classification not widely evolution human evolution anthropology homo timeline human evolution gorilla australopithecus homo erectus neanderthal steinheim skull homo sapiens scientific study human evolution primarily with the development the genus homo but usually involves studying other hominids and hominines such australopithecus modern are defined the homo sapiens species which the only extant subspecies known homo sapiens sapiens homo sapiens idaltu roughly translated elder wise the other known now homo neanderthalensis which became extinct years has sometimes been classified homo sapiens neanderthalensis genetic studies now suggest that the functional dna modern humans and neanderthals diverged years similarly the discovered specimens the homo rhodesiensis species have been classified some but this classification not widely anatomically modern humans first appear the fossil record africa about years and studies molecular biology give evidence that the approximate time divergence from the common ancestor all modern human populations was years the broad study african genetic diversity found the khomani san people express the greatest genetic diversity among the distinct populations making them one ancestral population the research also located the origin modern human migration western near the coastal border namibia and angola evolutionary history primates the evolutionary history primates can traced back million years mya primates are one the oldest all surviving placental mammal the oldest known like mammal species those the genus plesiadapis come from north but inhabited eurasia and africa wide scale during the tropical conditions the paleocene and eocene within family hominidae orangutans ponginae were the first followed gorillas molecular evidence suggests that the last common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees pan diverged million years making humans and chimps the closest relations among the great current estimates suggested concurrence between functional human and chimpanzee dna sequences range between and the functional portion human dna approximately identical that chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms see human evolutionary genetics early estimates indicated that the human lineage may have diverged from that chimpanzees about five million years and from that gorillas about eight million years however hominid skull discovered chad classified sahelanthropus tchadensis approximately seven million years and may evidence earlier human evolution characterized number important developmental physiological and which have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor humans and the first major morphological change was the evolution bipedal locomotor adaptation from arboreal arboreal one with all its attendant adaptations valgus knee low intermembral index long legs relative the reduced body the human species developed much larger brain than that other primates typically modern over twice the size that chimpanzee the pattern human postnatal brain growth differs from that other apes heterochrony and allows for extended periods social learning and language acquisition juvenile physical anthropologists argue that the differences between the structure human brains and those other apes are even more significant than their differences other significant morphological changes included the evolution power and precision grip reduced masticatory reduction the canine tooth
