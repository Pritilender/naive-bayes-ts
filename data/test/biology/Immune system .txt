immune system latest accepted revision accepted july navigation search scanning electron microscope neutrophil anthrax the immune system system biological structures and processes within organism that protects against disease function immune system must detect wide variety known pathogens from viruses parasitic worms and distinguish them from the own healthy tissue many the immune system can classified into such the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system humoral immunity versus cell mediated immunity pathogens can rapidly evolve and and thereby avoid detection and neutralization the immune however multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved recognize and neutralize even simple unicellular organisms such bacteria possess rudimentary immune the form enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections other basic immune mechanisms evolved ancient eukaryotes and remain their modern such plants and these mechanisms include phagocytosis antimicrobial peptides called defensins and the complement system jawed vertebrates including have even more sophisticated defense including the ability adapt over time recognize specific pathogens more adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after initial response specific leading enhanced response subsequent encounters with that same this process acquired immunity the basis vaccination disorders the immune system can result autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancer immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system less active than resulting recurring and threatening immunodeficiency can either the result genetic disease such severe combined immunodeficiency acquired conditions such hiv aids the use immunosuppressive autoimmunity results from hyperactive immune system attacking normal

references external links history immunology history immunology paul ehrlich immunology science that examines the structure and function the immune originates from medicine and early studies the causes immunity the earliest known reference immunity was during the plague athens thucydides noted that people who had recovered from previous bout the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness second the pierre louis moreau maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune this this and other observations acquired immunity were later exploited louis pasteur his development vaccination and his proposed germ theory disease pasteur theory was direct opposition contemporary theories such the miasma theory was not until robert koch proofs for which was awarded nobel prize that microorganisms were confirmed the cause infectious disease viruses were confirmed human pathogens with the discovery the yellow fever virus walter reed immunology made great advance towards the end the through rapid the study humoral immunity and cellular immunity particularly important was the work paul ehrlich who proposed the side chain theory explain the specificity the antigen antibody reaction his contributions the understanding humoral immunity were recognized the award nobel prize which was jointly awarded the founder cellular elie metchnikoff layered defense the immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses increasing simple physical barriers prevent pathogens such bacteria and viruses from entering the pathogen breaches these the innate immune system provides but specific innate immune systems are found all plants and animals pathogens successfully evade the innate vertebrates possess second layer the adaptive immune system which activated the innate here the immune system adapts its response during infection improve its recognition the this improved response then retained after the pathogen has been the form immunological memory and allows the adaptive immune system mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen components the immune system innate immune system adaptive immune system antigen mediated humoral mediated humoral immunological memory jawed vertebrates both innate and adaptive immunity depend the ability the immune system distinguish between self and self molecules immunology self molecules are those components body that can distinguished from foreign substances the immune conversely non self molecules are those recognized foreign one class self molecules are called antigens short for anti body gen and are defined substances that bind specific immune receptors and elicit immune innate immune system innate immune system microorganisms toxins that successfully enter organism encounter the cells and mechanisms the innate immune the innate response usually triggered when microbes are identified pattern recognition receptors which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups when injured stressed cells send out alarm many which but not are recognized the same receptors those that recognize innate immune defenses are meaning these systems respond pathogens generic this system does not confer lasting immunity against the innate immune system the dominant system host defense most surface barriers several barriers protect organisms from including chemical and biological the waxy cuticle many leaves the exoskeleton insects the shells and membranes externally deposited eggs and skin are examples mechanical barriers that are the first line defense against however organisms cannot completely sealed from their other systems act protect body openings such the lungs intestines and the genitourinary tract the coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract the flushing action tears and urine also mechanically expels while mucus secreted the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves trap and entangle microorganisms chemical barriers also protect against the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such the defensins enzymes such lysozyme and phospholipase saliva tears and breast milk are also antibacterials vaginal secretions serve chemical barrier following menarche when they become slightly acidic while semen contains defensins and zinc kill the stomach gastric acid and proteases serve powerful chemical defenses against ingested within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal commensal flora serve biological barriers competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space some changing the conditions their such available this reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers cause however since most antibiotics non specifically target bacteria and not affect oral antibiotics can lead overgrowth fungi and cause conditions such vaginal candidiasis yeast there good evidence that introduction probiotic flora such pure cultures the lactobacilli normally found unpasteurized yogurt helps restore healthy balance microbial populations intestinal infections children and encouraging preliminary data studies bacterial gastroenteritis inflammatory bowel diseases urinary tract infection and post surgical infections inflammation inflammation inflammation one the first responses the immune system the symptoms inflammation are swelling heat and which are caused increased blood flow into inflammation produced eicosanoids and cytokines which are released injured infected eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation blood vessels associated with and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood chemokines that promote chemotaxis and interferons that have anti viral effects such shutting down protein synthesis the host growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also these cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells the site infection and promote healing any damaged tissue following the removal complement system complement system the complement system biochemical cascade that attacks the surfaces foreign contains over different proteins and named for its ability complement the killing pathogens antibodies complement the major humoral component the innate immune many species have complement including mammals like fish and some invertebrates this response activated complement binding antibodies that have attached these microbes the binding complement proteins carbohydrates the surfaces microbes this recognition signal triggers rapid killing the speed the response result signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation complement which are also proteases after complement proteins initially bind the they activate their protease which turn activates other complement and this produces catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal controlled positive feedback the cascade results the production peptides that attract immune increase vascular permeability and opsonize the surface marking for this deposition complement can also kill cells directly disrupting their plasma membrane cellular barriers scanning electron microscope blood red blood cells lymphocytes monocyte neutrophil platelets leukocytes white blood cells act like single celled organisms and are the second arm the innate immune the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells mast cells eosinophils basophils and natural killer cells these cells identify and eliminate either attacking larger pathogens through contact engulfing and then killing innate cells are also important mediators the activation the adaptive immune system phagocytosis important feature cellular innate immunity performed cells called phagocytes that pathogens phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for but can called specific locations cytokines once pathogen has been engulfed becomes trapped intracellular vesicle called phagosome which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called lysosome form phagolysosome the pathogen killed the activity digestive enzymes following respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagocytosis evolved means acquiring nutrients but this role was extended phagocytes include engulfment pathogens defense phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form host phagocytes have been identified both vertebrate and invertebrate neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body pursuit invading neutrophils are normally found the bloodstream and are the most abundant type normally representing the total circulating during the acute phase particularly result bacterial neutrophils migrate toward the site inflammation process called and are usually the first cells arrive the scene macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce wide array chemicals including complement proteins and regulatory factors such interleukin macrophages also act ridding the body out cells and other and antigen presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune dendritic cells are phagocytes tissues that are contact with the external therefore they are located mainly the skin nose lungs stomach and intestines they are named for their resemblance neuronal dendrites both have many like but dendritic cells are way connected the nervous system dendritic cells serve link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune they present antigen cells one the key cell types the adaptive immune mast cells reside connective tissues and mucous membranes and regulate the inflammatory they are most often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis basophils and eosinophils are related they secrete chemical mediators that are involved defending against parasites and play role allergic such asthma natural killer cells cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells cells that have been infected natural killer cells natural killer cell natural killer cells are component the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading rather cells destroy compromised host such tumor cells infected recognizing such cells condition known missing this term describes cells with low levels surface marker called mhc major histocompatibility complex situation that can arise viral infections host they were named natural because the initial notion that they not require activation order kill cells that are missing for many years was unclear how cells recognize tumor cells and infected now known that the mhc makeup the surface those cells altered and the cells become activated through recognition missing normal body cells are not recognized and attacked cells because they express intact self mhc those mhc antigens are recognized killer cell immunoglobulin receptors which essentially put the brakes adaptive immune system adaptive immune system the adaptive immune system evolved early vertebrates and allows for stronger immune response well immunological where each pathogen remembered signature the adaptive immune response specific and requires the recognition specific antigens during process called antigen presentation antigen specificity allows for the generation responses that are tailored specific pathogens infected the ability mount these tailored responses maintained the body memory should pathogen infect the body more than these specific memory cells are used quickly eliminate lymphocytes the cells the adaptive immune system are special types called lymphocytes cells and cells are the major types lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells the bone marrow cells are involved the humoral immune response whereas cells are involved cell mediated immune response both cells and cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific cells recognize target such only after antigens small fragments the have been processed and presented combination with self receptor called major histocompatibility complex molecule there are two major subtypes the killer cell and the helper cell killer cells only recognize antigens coupled class mhc molecules while helper cells only recognize antigens coupled class mhc molecules these two mechanisms antigen presentation reflect the different roles the two types minor subtype are the cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound mhc the cell specific receptor antibody molecule the cell and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for antigen processing each lineage cell expresses different the complete set cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the body can killer cells killer cells are group cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses and other are otherwise damaged with each type cell recognizes different killer cells are activated when their cell receptor binds this specific antigen complex with the mhc class receptor another recognition this antigen complex aided receptor the called the cell then travels throughout the body search cells where the mhc receptors bear this when activated cell contacts such releases cytotoxins such perforin which form pores the target plasma membrane allowing ions water and toxins the entry another toxin called granulysin induces the target cell undergo apoptosis cell killing host cells particularly important preventing the replication cell activation tightly controlled and generally requires very strong antigen activation additional activation signals provided helper cells see helper cells apcs macrophages killer cells cells antibodies helper cells regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help determine which immune responses the body makes particular these cells have cytotoxic activity and not kill infected cells clear pathogens they instead control the immune response directing other cells perform these helper cells express cell receptors that recognize antigen bound class mhc the antigen complex also recognized the helper which recruits molecules inside the cell lck that are responsible for the helper cells have weaker association with the antigen complex than observed for killer meaning many receptors around the helper cell must bound antigen order activate the helper while killer cells can activated engagement single antigen helper cell activation also requires longer duration engagement with presenting the activation resting helper cell causes release cytokines that influence the activity many cell cytokine signals produced helper cells enhance the microbicidal function macrophages and the activity killer helper cell activation causes upregulation molecules expressed the such ligand also called which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required activate producing cells cells possess alternative cell receptor opposed and cells and share the characteristics helper cytotoxic cells and the conditions that produce responses from cells are not fully like other cell subsets bearing invariant such restricted natural killer cells cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive one cells are component adaptive immunity they rearrange tcr genes produce receptor diversity and can also develop memory the other the various subsets are also part the innate immune restricted tcr receptors may used pattern recognition receptors for large numbers human cells respond within hours common molecules produced and highly restricted cells epithelia respond stressed epithelial lymphocytes and antibodies cell identifies pathogens when antibodies its surface bind specific foreign this antibody complex taken the cell and processed proteolysis into the cell then displays these antigenic peptides its surface mhc class this combination mhc and antigen attracts matching helper which releases lymphokines and activates the the activated cell then begins divide its offspring plasma cells secrete millions copies the antibody that recognizes this these antibodies circulate blood plasma and lymph bind pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction complement activation for uptake and destruction antibodies can also neutralize challenges binding bacterial toxins interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use infect alternative adaptive immune system evolution the adaptive immune system occurred ancestor the jawed many the classical molecules the adaptive immune system immunoglobulins and cell receptors exist only jawed however distinct lymphocyte derived molecule has been discovered primitive jawless vertebrates such the lamprey and hagfish these animals possess large array molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors that like the antigen receptors jawed are produced from only small number one genes these molecules are believed bind pathogenic antigens similar way and with the same degree immunological memory immunity when cells and cells are activated and begin some their offspring become lived memory throughout the lifetime these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount strong response the pathogen detected this adaptive because occurs during the lifetime individual adaptation infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future immunological memory can the form either passive term memory active term passive memory newborn infants have prior exposure microbes and are particularly vulnerable several layers passive protection are provided the during pregnancy particular type called igg transported from mother baby directly across the placenta human babies have high levels antibodies even with the same range antigen specificities their breast milk colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred the gut the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own this passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells only borrows this passive immunity usually lasting from few days several protective passive immunity can also transferred artificially from one individual another via rich serum active memory and immunization long term active memory acquired following infection activation and active immunity can also generated through vaccination the principle behind vaccination also called immunization introduce antigen from pathogen order stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that this deliberate induction immune response successful because exploits the natural specificity the immune well its with infectious disease remaining one the leading causes death the human vaccination represents the most effective manipulation the immune system mankind has most viral vaccines are based live attenuated viruses while many bacterial vaccines are based acellular components including harmless toxin components since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines not strongly induce the adaptive most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen presenting cells the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity disorders human immunity the immune system remarkably effective structure that incorporates inducibility and failures host defense however and fall into three broad immunodeficiencies autoimmunity and immunodeficiencies immunodeficiency immunodeficiencies occur when one more the components the immune system are the ability the immune system respond pathogens diminished both the young and the elderly with immune responses beginning decline around years age due immunosenescence developed countries obesity alcoholism and drug use are common causes poor immune however malnutrition the most common cause immunodeficiency developing countries diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired mediated complement phagocyte iga antibody and cytokine additionally the loss the thymus early age through genetic mutation surgical removal results severe immunodeficiency and high susceptibility immunodeficiencies can also inherited acquired chronic granulomatous disease where phagocytes have reduced ability destroy example congenital immunodeficiency aids and some types cancer cause acquired autoimmunity autoimmunity overactive immune responses comprise the other end immune particularly the autoimmune disorders here the immune system fails properly distinguish between self and and attacks part the under normal many cells and antibodies react with self peptides one the functions specialized cells located the thymus and bone marrow present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and eliminate those cells that recognize preventing hypersensitivity hypersensitivity hypersensitivity immune response that damages the own they are divided into four classes type based the mechanisms involved and the time course the hypersensitive type hypersensitivity immediate anaphylactic reaction often associated with allergy symptoms can range from mild discomfort type hypersensitivity mediated ige which triggers degranulation mast cells and basophils when linked type hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind antigens the own marking them for this also called dependent hypersensitivity and mediated igg and igm antibodies immune complexes aggregations complement and igg and igm deposited various tissues trigger type iii hypersensitivity type hypersensitivity also known mediated delayed type hypersensitivity usually takes between two and three days type reactions are involved many autoimmune and infectious but may also involve contact dermatitis poison ivy these reactions are mediated cells monocytes and macrophages other mechanisms innate immune system other forms innate immunity likely that adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates invertebrates not generate lymphocytes based humoral many however utilize mechanisms that appear precursors these aspects vertebrate immune systems appear even the structurally most simple forms with bacteria using unique defense called the restriction modification system protect themselves from viral called bacteriophages prokaryotes also possess acquired through system that uses crispr sequences retain fragments the genomes phage that they have come into contact with the which allows them block virus replication through form rna interference pattern recognition receptors are proteins used nearly all organisms identify molecules associated with antimicrobial peptides called defensins are evolutionarily conserved component the innate immune response found all animals and and represent the main form invertebrate systemic immunity the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used most forms invertebrate ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes and are thought play role the immune response unlike plants lack phagocytic but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through individual plant cells respond molecules associated with pathogens known pathogen associated molecular patterns when part plant becomes the plant produces localized hypersensitive response whereby cells the site infection undergo rapid apoptosis prevent the spread the disease other parts the systemic acquired resistance type defensive response used plants that renders the entire plant resistant particular infectious rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important this systemic response they can block virus tumor immunology cancer immunology macrophages immunotherapy cancer another important role the immune system identify and eliminate tumors the transformed cells tumors express antigens that are not found normal the immune these antigens appear and their presence causes immune cells attack the transformed tumor the antigens expressed tumors have several some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus which causes cervical cancer while others are the own proteins that occur low levels normal cells but reach high levels tumor one example enzyme called tyrosinase that when expressed high transforms certain skin cells melanocytes into tumors called melanomas third possible source tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes the main response the immune system tumors destroy the abnormal cells using killer sometimes with the assistance helper tumor antigens are presented mhc class molecules similar way viral this allows killer cells recognize the tumor cell cells also kill tumorous cells similar especially the tumor cells have fewer mhc class molecules their surface than this common phenomenon with sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction the complement system clearly some tumors evade the immune system and become tumor cells often have reduced number mhc class molecules their thus avoiding detection killer some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune for example secreting the cytokine tgf which suppresses the activity macrophages and lymphocytes immunological tolerance may develop against tumor the immune system longer attacks the tumor paradoxically macrophages can promote tumor growth when tumor cells send out cytokines that attract which then generate cytokines and growth factors that nurture tumor combination hypoxia the tumor and cytokine produced macrophages induces tumor cells decrease production protein that blocks metastasis and thereby assists spread cancer physiological regulation hormones can act immunomodulators altering the sensitivity the immune for female sex hormones are known immunostimulators both adaptive and innate immune some autoimmune diseases such lupus erythematosus strike women and their onset often coincides with puberty male sex hormones such testosterone seem immunosuppressive other hormones appear regulate the immune system most notably prolactin growth hormone and vitamin when cell encounters foreign pathogen extends vitamin receptor this essentially signaling device that allows the cell bind the active form vitamin the steroid hormone calcitriol cells have symbiotic relationship with vitamin not only does the cell extend vitamin receptor essence asking bind the steroid hormone version vitamin calcitriol but the cell expresses the gene cyp which the gene responsible for converting the hormone version vitamin calcidiol into the steroid hormone calcitriol only after binding calcitriol can cells perform their intended other immune system cells that are known express cyp and thus activate vitamin calcidiol are dendritic cells keratinocytes and macrophages conjectured that progressive decline hormone levels with age partially responsible for weakened immune responses aging conversely some hormones are regulated the immune notably thyroid hormone activity the related decline immune function also related dropping vitamin levels the people two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin first they stay indoors more due decreased activity this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation second person ages the skin becomes less adept producing vitamin sleep and rest the immune system affected sleep and and sleep deprivation detrimental immune complex feedback loops involving cytokines such interleukin and tumor necrosis produced response appear also play role the regulation rapid eye movement rem sleep thus the immune response infection may result changes the sleep including increase slow wave sleep relative rem when suffering from sleep active immunizations may have diminished effect and may result lower antibody and lowered immune then would noted rested additionally proteins such which have been shown closely intertwined with both cell differentiation and our circadian which can affected through the disturbance natural light and dark cycles through instances sleep shift etc result these disruptions can lead increase chronic conditions such heart chronic and addition the negative consequences sleep sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown have strong regulatory effects immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive first during the early sleep sudden drop blood levels epinephrine and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels the hormones pituitary growth and these signals induce inflammatory state through the production the inflammatory cytokines interleukin tnf alpha and these cytokines then stimulate immune functions such immune cells proliferation and during this time that less like and central memory peak during time slowly evolving adaptive immune addition these the milieu hormones produced this time pituitary growth and support the interactions between and shift the cytokine balance towards one that supports increase overall cell and cell migration lymph this milieu also thought support the formation lasting immune memory through the initiation immune during wake periods differentiated effector such cytotoxic natural killer cells and peak order elicit effective response against any intruding well during awake active anti inflammatory such cortisol and peak there are two theories why the inflammatory state reserved for sleep first inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments were occur during wake second inflammation may occur during sleep times due the presence inflammation causes great deal oxidative stress and the presence melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this nutrition and diet overnutrition associated with diseases such diabetes and obesity which are known affect immune more moderate well certain specific trace mineral and nutrient can also compromise the immune page needed foods rich certain fatty acids may foster healthy immune likewise fetal undernourishment can cause lifelong impairment the immune manipulation medicine immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone the immune response can manipulated suppress unwanted responses resulting from allergy and transplant rejection and stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system see immunization immunosuppressive drugs are used control autoimmune disorders inflammation when excessive tissue damage and prevent transplant rejection after organ transplant anti inflammatory drugs are often used control the effects glucocorticoids are the most powerful these however these drugs can have many undesirable side effects such central obesity hyperglycemia osteoporosis and their use must tightly lower doses inflammatory drugs are often used conjunction with cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs such methotrexate azathioprine cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response killing dividing cells such activated however the killing indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are which causes toxic side immunosuppressive drugs such cyclosporin prevent cells from responding signals correctly inhibiting signal transduction pathways larger drugs can provoke neutralizing immune particularly the drugs are administered larger this limits the effectiveness drugs based larger peptides and proteins which are typically larger than some the drug itself not but may administered with immunogenic sometimes the case for taxol computational methods have been developed predict the immunogenicity peptides and which are particularly useful designing therapeutic assessing likely virulence mutations viral coat and validation proposed based drug early techniques relied mainly the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented epitope regions than hydrophobic amino however more recent developments rely machine learning techniques using databases existing known usually studied virus training set publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing epitopes from pathogens known recognizable the emerging field bioinformatics based studies immunogenicity referred immunoinformatics immunoproteomics the study large sets proteins proteomics involved the immune manipulation pathogens the success any pathogen depends its ability elude host immune therefore pathogens evolved several methods that allow them successfully infect while evading detection destruction the immune bacteria often overcome physical barriers secreting enzymes that digest the for using type secretion system alternatively using type iii secretion system they may insert hollow tube into the host providing direct route for proteins move from the pathogen the these proteins are often used shut down host evasion strategy used several pathogens avoid the innate immune system hide within the cells their host also called intracellular pathogenesis here pathogen spends most its life cycle inside host where shielded from direct contact with immune antibodies and some examples intracellular pathogens include the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria plasmodium falciparum and leishmaniasis leishmania other such mycobacterium tuberculosis live inside protective capsule that prevents lysis many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish misdirect the immune some bacteria form biofilms protect themselves from the cells and proteins the immune such biofilms are present many successful the chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic cystic fibrosis other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind rendering them examples include streptococcus protein staphylococcus aureus protein and peptostreptococcus magnus protein the mechanisms used evade the adaptive immune system are more the simplest approach rapidly change essential epitopes amino acids and the surface the while keeping essential epitopes this called antigenic variation example which mutates the proteins its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly these frequent changes antigens may explain the failures vaccines directed this the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses similar constantly switching one type surface protein for allowing stay one step ahead the antibody masking antigens with host molecules another common strategy for avoiding detection the immune the envelope that covers the virion formed from the outermost membrane the host such viruses
