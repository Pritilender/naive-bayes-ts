materialist holding that all that exists and that life merely complex form arrangement empedocles argued that every thing the universe made combination four eternal elements roots earth water air and all change explained the arrangement and rearrangement these four the various forms life are caused appropriate mixture democritus thought that the essential characteristic life having soul psyche like other ancient was attempting explain what makes something living thing his explanation was that fiery atoms make soul exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other elaborates fire because the apparent connection between life and and because fire plato world eternal and unchanging forms imperfectly represented matter divine artisan contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic weltanschauungen which atomism was the fourth century the most this debate persisted throughout the ancient atomistic mechanism got shot the arm from epicurus while the stoics adopted divine the choice seems either show how regular world could arise out undirected inject intelligence into the cause and explanation ancient greek thought the mechanistic materialism that originated ancient greece was revived and revised the french philosopher ren descartes who held that animals and humans were assemblages parts that together functioned the the advances cell theory biological science encouraged this the evolutionary theory charles darwin mechanistic explanation for the origin species means natural selection hylomorphism hylomorphism theory originating with aristotle that all things are combination matter and biology was one his main and there extensive biological material his extant this all things the material universe have both matter and and the form living thing its soul greek psyche latin anima there are three kinds the vegetative soul which causes them grow and decay and nourish but does not cause motion and the animal soul which causes animals move and and the rational soul which the source consciousness and which aristotle found only each higher soul has all the attributes the lower aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form cannot exist without and therefore the soul cannot exist without the this account consistent with teleological explanations which account for phenomena terms purpose thus the whiteness the polar coat explained its purpose the direction causality from the future the contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural which explains the consequence terms prior biological features are explained not looking future optimal but looking the past evolutionary history which led the natural selection the features vitalism vitalism the belief that the principle this originated with stahl and held sway until the middle the appealed philosophers such henri bergson nietzsche wilhelm dilthey anatomists like bichat and chemists like liebig vitalism included the idea that there was fundamental difference between organic and inorganic and the belief that organic material can only derived from living this was disproved when friedrich hler prepared urea from inorganic this hler synthesis considered the starting point modern organic chemistry historical significance because for the first time organic compound was produced from inorganic reactants during the helmholtz anticipated mayer demonstrated that energy lost muscle suggesting that there were vital necessary move these results led the abandonment scientific interest vitalistic although the belief lingered pseudoscientific theories such homeopathy which interprets diseases and sickness caused disturbances hypothetical vital force life definitions challenge for scientists and philosophers define life unequivocal this difficult partly because life not pure any definition must sufficiently broad encompass all life with which are and must sufficiently general include life that may fundamentally different from life some may even consider that life not real but concept biology since there unequivocal definition the current understanding life considered characteristic something that exhibits all most the following homeostasis regulation the internal environment maintain constant for electrolyte concentration sweating reduce organization being structurally composed one more cells the basic units metabolism transformation energy converting chemicals and energy into cellular components anabolism and decomposing organic matter catabolism living things require energy maintain internal organization and produce the other phenomena associated

entropy and life reflect the minimum phenomena other biological definitions life have been many these are based upon chemical biophysicists have commented that living things function negative entropy other living processes can viewed delay the spontaneous diffusion dispersion the internal energy biological molecules towards more potential microstates more according physicists such john bernal

organizing and autopoietic variations this definition include stuart kauffman definition autonomous agent multi agent system capable reproducing itself and completing least one thermodynamic work cycle life can modeled network inferior negative feedbacks regulatory mechanisms subordinated superior positive feedback formed the potential expansion and alternatively life can said consist things with the capacity for metabolism and that life reproduction with with error rate below the sustainability viruses adenovirus viruses are most often considered replicators rather than forms they have been described organisms the edge since they possess genes evolve natural and replicate creating multiple copies themselves through however viruses not metabolize and they require host cell make new virus assembly within host cells has implications for the study the origin life may support the hypothesis that life could have started assembling organic living systems theories the idea that the earth alive found philosophy and but the first scientific discussion was the scottish scientist james hutton stated that the earth was superorganism and that its proper study should physiology hutton considered the father geology but his idea living earth was forgotten the intense reductionism the the gaia hypothesis proposed the scientist james lovelock suggests that life earth functions single organism that defines and maintains environmental conditions necessary for its the first attempt general living systems theory for explaining the nature life was american biologist james grier miller such general arising out the ecological and biological sciences attempts map general principles for how all living systems instead examining phenomena attempting break things down into component general living systems theory explores phenomena terms dynamic patterns the relationships organisms with their robert rosen built this defining system component unit part with definite relation between part and from this and other starting developed relational theory that attempts explain the special properties specifically identified the nonfractionability components the fundamental difference between living systems and biological systems view life treats environmental fluxes and biological fluxes together reciprocity and reciprocal relation with environment arguably important for understanding life for understanding harold morowitz explains life property ecological system rather than single organism argues that ecosystemic definition life preferable strictly biochemical physical robert ulanowicz highlights mutualism the key understand the order generating behavior life and complex systems biology field science that studies the emergence complexity functional organisms from the viewpoint dynamic systems theory the latter often called also systems biology and aims understand the most fundamental aspects closely related approach csb and systems called relational concerned mainly with understanding life processes terms the most important relations and categories such relations among the essential functional components for multicellular this has been defined categorical model representation organisms category theory biological and also algebraic topology the functional organization living organisms terms their complex networks genetic epigenetic processes and signaling pathways citation needed has also been argued that the evolution order living systems and certain physical systems obey common fundamental principle termed the darwinian the darwinian dynamic was formulated first considering how macroscopic order generated simple biological system far from thermodynamic and then extending consideration replicating rna the underlying order generating process for both types system was concluded basically origin abiogenesis evidence suggests that life earth has existed for least billion years with the oldest physical traces life dating back billion national institutes health study the authors hypothesize that biological complexity increased exponentially during evolution life the universe may have begun nearly billion years ago billions years before the earth suggesting that earth was seeded panspermia directed panspermia all known life forms share fundamental molecular reflecting their common descent based these hypotheses the origin life attempt find mechanism explaining the formation universal common ancestor from simple organic molecules via cellular life protocells and models have been divided into and categories but recent trend the emergence hybrid models that combine both there current scientific consensus how life however most accepted scientific models build the following the miller urey experiment and the work sidney fox show that conditions the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize amino acids and other organic compounds from inorganic phospholipids spontaneously form lipid bilayers the basic structure cell membrane living organisms synthesize proteins which are polymers amino acids using instructions encoded deoxyribonucleic acid protein synthesis entails intermediary ribonucleic acid polymers one possibility for how life began that genes originated followed the alternative being that proteins came first and then however since genes and proteins are both required produce the the problem considering which came first like that the chicken the egg most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because unlikely that genes and proteins arose therefore first suggested francis crick that the first life was based rna which has the like properties information storage and the catalytic properties some this called the rna world hypothesis and supported the observation that many the most critical components cells those that evolve the are composed mostly entirely also many critical cofactors atp acetyl coa nadh etc are either nucleotides substances clearly related the catalytic properties rna had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first but they were confirmed thomas cech one issue with the rna world hypothesis that synthesis rna from simple inorganic precursors more difficult than for other organic one reason for this that rna precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient and has also been proposed that living organisms consisted other molecules before however the successful synthesis certain rna molecules under the conditions that existed prior life earth has been achieved adding alternative precursors specified order with the precursor phosphate present throughout the this study makes the rna world hypothesis more geological findings showed that reactive phosphorus species like phosphite were abundance the ocean before and that schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous glycerol generate phosphite and glycerol phosphate hypothesized that schreibersite containing meteorites from the late heavy bombardment could have provided early reduced which could react with prebiotic organic molecules form phosphorylated biomolecules like rna experiments demonstrated darwinian evolution component system rna enzymes ribozymes vitro the work was performed the laboratory gerald joyce who this the first outside evolutionary adaptation molecular genetic prebiotic compounds may have extraterrestrial nasa findings based studies with meteorites found suggest dna and rna components adenine guanine and related organic may formed outer space conditions cyanobacteria dramatically changed intolerant organisms the diversity life earth result the dynamic interplay between genetic opportunity metabolic environmental challenges and symbiosis for most its earth habitable environment has been dominated microorganisms and subjected their metabolism and consequence these microbial the chemical environment earth has been changing geologic time scale thereby affecting the path evolution subsequent for the release molecular oxygen cyanobacteria product photosynthesis induced global changes the since oxygen was toxic most life earth the this posed novel evolutionary and ultimately resulted the formation our major animal and plant this interplay between organisms and their environment inherent feature living all life forms require certain core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning these include carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur the elemental macronutrients for all organisms often represented the acronym together these make nucleic acids proteins and lipids the bulk living five these six elements comprise the chemical components the exception being the latter component the amino acids cysteine and methionine the most biologically abundant these elements which has the desirable attribute forming stable covalent bonds this allows based molecules form immense variety chemical alternative

ecosystem are the physical and chemical factors necessary for energy sunlight chemical energy water temperature atmosphere gravity nutrients and ultraviolet solar radiation protection most the conditions vary during the day and from one season the live most then organisms must able survive range called the range outside that are the zones physiological where the survival and reproduction are possible but not beyond these zones are the zones where survival and reproduction that organism unlikely organisms that have wide range tolerance are more widely distributed than organisms with narrow range deinococcus radiodurans extremophile selected microorganisms can assume forms that enable them withstand freezing complete desiccation starvation high levels radiation exposure and other physical chemical these microorganisms may survive exposure such conditions for months years even extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life commonly they excel exploiting uncommon sources while all organisms are composed nearly identical molecules evolution has enabled such microbes cope with this wide range physical and chemical characterization the structure and metabolic diversity microbial communities such extreme environments march researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive the mariana trench the deepest spot the other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks feet below the sea floor under feet ocean off the coast the northwestern united according one the you can find microbes they extremely adaptable and survive wherever they investigation the tenacity and versatility life well understanding the molecular systems that some organisms utilize survive such important for the search for life beyond earth april scientists reported that lichen could survive for month simulated martian environment form and function cells are the basic unit structure every living and all cells arise from existing cells division cell theory was formulated henri dutrochet theodor schwann rudolf virchow and others during the early nineteenth and subsequently became widely the activity organism depends the total activity its with energy flow occurring within and between cells contain hereditary information that carried forward genetic code during cell there are two primary types prokaryotes lack nucleus and other bound organelles although they have circular dna and ribosomes bacteria and archaea are two domains the other primary type cells are the eukaryotes which have distinct nuclei bound nuclear membrane and bound including mitochondria chloroplasts lysosomes rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic all species large complex organisms are including plants and though most species eukaryote are protist microorganisms the conventional model that eukaryotes evolved from with the main organelles the eukaryotes forming through endosymbiosis between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic the molecular mechanisms cell biology are based proteins most these are synthesized the ribosomes through enzyme catalyzed process called protein biosynthesis sequence amino acids assembled and joined together based upon gene expression the nucleic eukaryotic these proteins may then transported and processed through the golgi apparatus preparation for dispatch their cells reproduce through process cell division which the parent cell divides into two more daughter for cell division occurs through process fission which the dna then the two copies are attached parts the cell eukaryotes more complex process mitosis however the end result the the resulting cell copies are identical each other and the original cell except for mutations and both are capable further division following interphase period multicellular organisms may have first evolved through the formation colonies like these cells can form group organisms through cell adhesion the individual members colony are capable surviving their whereas the members true cellular organism have developed making them dependent the remainder the organism for such organisms are formed clonally from single germ cell that capable forming the various specialized cells that form the adult this specialization allows multicellular organisms exploit resources more efficiently than single cells have evolved methods perceive and respond their thereby enhancing their cell signaling coordinates cellular and hence governs the basic functions multicellular signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using juxtacrine signalling indirectly through the exchange agents the endocrine system more complex coordination activities can occur through dedicated nervous system classification biological classification biological classification taxonomic ranks the first known attempt classify organisms was conducted the greek philosopher aristotle who classified all living organisms known that time either plant animal based mainly their ability also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood least without red which can compared with the concepts vertebrates and invertebrates respectively and divided the blooded animals into five viviparous quadrupeds mammals oviparous quadrupeds reptiles and amphibians birds fishes and whales the bloodless animals were also divided into five cephalopods crustaceans insects which included the spiders scorpions and centipedes addition what define insects shelled animals such most molluscs and echinoderms and zoophytes though work zoology was not without was the grandest biological synthesis the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his the exploration the american continent revealed large numbers new plants and animals that needed descriptions and the latter part the century and the beginning the careful study animals commenced and was gradually extended until formed sufficient body knowledge serve anatomical basis for the late carolus linnaeus introduced his system binomial nomenclature for the classification linnaeus attempted improve the composition and reduce the length the previously used worded names abolishing unnecessary introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their consistently using this linnaeus separated nomenclature from taxonomy the fungi were originally treated for short period linnaeus had classified them the taxon vermes but later placed them back copeland classified the fungi his thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special the problem was eventually solved whittaker when gave them their own kingdom his five kingdom system evolutionary history shows that the fungi are more closely related animals than new discoveries enabled detailed study cells and new groups life were and the fields cell biology and microbiology were these new organisms were originally described separately protozoa animals and protophyta thallophyta but were united haeckel the kingdom protista later the prokaryotes were split off the kingdom monera which would eventually divided into two separate the bacteria and the archaea this led the six kingdom system and eventually the current three domain system which based evolutionary however the classification especially still molecular biology and virology developed non cellular reproducing agents were such viruses and viroids whether these are considered alive has been matter viruses lack characteristics life such cell metabolism and the ability grow respond their viruses can still classed into species based their biology and genetics but many aspects such classification remain the trend called cladistics emerged
