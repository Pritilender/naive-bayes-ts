metabolism navigation search cell metabolism metabolism adenosine triphosphate metabolism from greek metabol change the set life sustaining chemical transformations within the cells living organisms these enzyme catalyzed reactions allow organisms grow and maintain their and respond their the word metabolism can also refer all chemical reactions that occur living including digestion and the transport substances into and between different which case the set reactions within the cells called intermediary metabolism intermediate metabolism metabolism usually divided into two catabolism that breaks down organic matter and harvests energy way cellular respiration and anabolism that uses energy construct components cells such proteins and nucleic acids the chemical reactions metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways which one chemical transformed through series steps into another sequence enzymes enzymes are crucial metabolism because they allow organisms drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur coupling them spontaneous reactions that release enzymes act catalysts that allow the reactions proceed more enzymes also allow the regulation metabolic pathways response changes the cell environment signals from other the metabolic system particular organism determines which substances will find nutritious and which poisonous for some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide yet this gas poisonous the speed the metabolic rate influences how much food organism will and also affects how able obtain that striking feature metabolism the similarity the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different for the set carboxylic acids that are best known the intermediates the citric acid cycle are present all known

classes molecule amino acids carbohydrates and lipids often called fats these molecules are vital for metabolic reactions either focus making these molecules during the construction cells and breaking them down and using them source their these biochemicals can joined together make polymers such dna and proteins essential macromolecules monomer polymer amino acids proteins fibrous proteins globular proteins carbohydrates monosaccharides polysaccharides starch glycogen cellulose nucleic acids nucleotides polynucleotides dna rna amino acids and proteins proteins are made amino acids arranged linear chain joined together peptide bonds many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions other proteins have structural mechanical such those that form the cytoskeleton system scaffolding that maintains the cell proteins are also important cell signaling immune responses cell adhesion active transport across and the cell cycle amino acids also contribute cellular energy metabolism providing carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle especially when primary source such glucose when cells undergo metabolic lipids lipids are the most diverse group their main structural uses are part biological membranes both internal and such the cell membrane source lipids are usually defined hydrophobic amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve organic solvents such benzene chloroform the fats are large group compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol glycerol molecule attached three fatty acid esters called triacylglyceride several variations this basic structure including alternate backbones such sphingosine the sphingolipids and hydrophilic groups such phosphate phospholipids steroids such cholesterol are another major class carbohydrates glucose carbohydrates are aldehydes ketones with many hydroxyl groups that can exist straight chains carbohydrates are the most abundant biological and fill numerous such the storage and transport energy starch glycogen and structural components cellulose chitin the basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose fructose and most importantly glucose monosaccharides can linked together form polysaccharides almost limitless nucleotides the two nucleic dna and rna are polymers nucleotides each nucleotide composed phosphate group made ribose sugar group with nitrogenous base nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use genetic and its interpretation through the processes transcription and protein biosynthesis this information protected dna repair mechanisms and propagated through dna replication many viruses have rna genome for example hiv which uses reverse transcription create dna template from its viral rna rna ribozymes such spliceosomes and ribosomes similar enzymes can catalyze chemical individual nucleosides are made attaching nucleobase ribose sugar these bases are heterocyclic rings containing classified purines pyrimidines nucleotides also act coenzymes transfer coenzymes coenzyme coa acetyl group coenzyme metabolism involves vast array chemical but most fall under few basic types reactions that involve the transfer functional groups atoms and their bonds within this common chemistry allows cells use small set metabolic intermediates carry chemical groups between different these transfer intermediates are called coenzymes each class transfer reactions carried out particular which the substrate for set enzymes that produce and set enzymes that consume these coenzymes are therefore continuously consumed and then one central coenzyme adenosine triphosphate the universal energy currency this nucleotide used transfer chemical energy between different chemical there only small amount atp but continuously the human body can use about its own weight atp per atp acts bridge between catabolism and anabolism catabolism breaks down molecules and anabolism puts them catabolic reactions generate atp and anabolic reactions consume also serves carrier phosphate groups phosphorylation reactions vitamin organic compound needed small quantities that cannot made human nutrition most vitamins function coenzymes after for all soluble vitamins are phosphorylated are coupled nucleotides when they are used nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad derivative vitamin niacin important coenzyme that acts hydrogen hundreds separate types dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce nad into this reduced form the coenzyme then substrate for any the reductases the cell that need reduce their nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists two related forms the nadh and the nad nadh form more important catabolic while nadp nadph used anabolic hemoglobin heme pdb gzx minerals and cofactors metal ions life sciences metal metabolism bioinorganic chemistry inorganic elements play critical roles some are abundant sodium and potassium while others function minute about mass made the elements carbon nitrogen calcium sodium chlorine potassium hydrogen phosphorus oxygen and sulfur organic compounds lipids and contain the majority the carbon and most the oxygen and hydrogen present the abundant inorganic elements act ionic electrolytes the most important ions are sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate the maintenance precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function action potentials these tissues are produced the exchange electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the the cytosol electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins the cell membrane called ion channels for muscle contraction depends upon the movement sodium and potassium through ion channels the cell membrane and tubules transition metals are usually present trace elements with zinc and iron being most abundant these metals are used some proteins cofactors and are essential for the activity enzymes such catalase and carrier proteins such hemoglobin metal cofactors are bound tightly specific sites although enzyme cofactors can modified during they always return their original state the end the reaction metal micronutrients are taken into organisms specific transporters and bind storage proteins such ferritin metallothionein when not catabolism catabolism the set metabolic processes that break down large these include breaking down and oxidizing food the purpose the catabolic reactions provide the energy and components needed anabolic the exact nature these catabolic reactions differ from organism organism and organisms can classified based their sources energy and carbon their primary nutritional groups shown the table organic molecules are used source energy organotrophs while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates and phototrophs capture sunlight chemical energy however all these different forms metabolism depend redox reactions that involve the transfer electrons from reduced donor molecules such organic molecules water ammonia hydrogen sulfide ferrous ions acceptor molecules such oxygen nitrate sulfate animals these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down simpler such carbon dioxide and photosynthetic organisms such plants and cyanobacteria these transfer reactions not release but are used way storing energy absorbed from organic compound inorganic compound organic compound inorganic compound the most common set catabolic reactions animals can separated into three main the large organic molecules such proteins polysaccharides lipids are digested into their smaller components outside next these smaller molecules are taken cells and converted yet smaller usually acetyl coenzyme which releases some finally the acetyl group the coa oxidised water and carbon dioxide the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain releasing the energy that stored reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad into digestion digestion gastrointestinal tract macromolecules such cellulose proteins cannot rapidly taken cells and must broken into their smaller units before they can used cell several common classes enzymes digest these these digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino well glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known monosaccharides microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells their guts the amino acids sugars released these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells active transport proteins proteins carbohydrates fats energy from organic compounds cellular respiration fermentation carbohydrate catabolism fat catabolism protein catabolism carbohydrate catabolism the breakdown carbohydrates into smaller carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides once the major route breakdown glycolysis where sugars such glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some atp pyruvate intermediate several metabolic but the majority converted acetyl coa and fed into the citric acid cycle although some more atp generated the citric acid the most important product which made from nad the coa this oxidation releases carbon dioxide waste anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase oxidizing nadh for use alternative route for glucose breakdown the pentose phosphate pathway which reduces the coenzyme nadph and produces pentose sugars such ribose the sugar component nucleic acids fats are catabolised hydrolysis free fatty acids and the glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down beta oxidation release which then fed into the citric acid fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen their amino acids are either used synthesize proteins and other oxidized urea and carbon dioxide source the oxidation pathway starts with the removal the amino group transaminase the amino group fed into the urea cycle leaving deaminated carbon skeleton the form keto acid several these keto acids are intermediates the citric acid for example the deamination glutamate forms ketoglutarate the glucogenic amino acids can also converted into through gluconeogenesis discussed energy transformations oxidative phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation chemiosmosis mitochondrion oxidative the electrons removed from organic molecules areas such the protagon acid cycle are transferred oxygen and the energy released used make this done eukaryotes series proteins the membranes mitochondria called the electron transport chain prokaryotes these proteins are found the inner membrane these proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like nadh onto oxygen pump protons across atp synthase pumping protons out the mitochondria creates proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates electrochemical gradient this force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base enzyme called atp synthase the flow protons makes the stalk subunit causing the active site the synthase domain change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate turning into energy from inorganic compounds microbial metabolism nitrogen cycle chemolithotrophy type metabolism found prokaryotes where energy obtained from the oxidation inorganic compounds these organisms can use hydrogen reduced sulfur compounds such sulfide hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate ferrous iron ammonia sources reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation these compounds with electron acceptors such oxygen nitrite these microbial processes are important global biogeochemical cycles such acetogenesis nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility energy from light phototroph photophosphorylation chloroplast the energy sunlight captured plants cyanobacteria purple bacteria green sulfur bacteria and some protists this process often coupled the conversion carbon dioxide into organic part which discussed the energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight source while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation organic many organisms the capture solar energy similar principle oxidative involves the storage energy proton concentration this proton motive force then drives atp the electrons needed drive this electron transport chain come from gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres rhodopsins reaction centers are classed into two types depending the type photosynthetic pigment present with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one while plants and cyanobacteria have algae and photosystem uses light energy remove electrons from releasing oxygen waste the electrons then flow the cytochrome complex which uses their energy pump protons across the thylakoid membrane the chloroplast these protons move back through the membrane they drive the atp the electrons then flow through photosystem and can then either used reduce the coenzyme nadp for use the calvin cycle which discussed recycled for further atp anabolism anabolism anabolism the set constructive metabolic processes where the energy released catabolism used synthesize complex the complex molecules that make cellular structures are constructed step from small and simple anabolism involves three basic firstly the production precursors such amino acids monosaccharides isoprenoids and nucleotides secondly their activation into reactive forms using energy from and the assembly these precursors into complex molecules such proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids organisms differ how many the molecules their cells they can construct for autotrophs such plants can construct the complex organic molecules cells such polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and heterotrophs the other require source more complex such monosaccharides and amino produce these complex organisms can further classified ultimate source their photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation carbon fixation photosynthesis carbon fixation chemosynthesis photosynthesis the synthesis carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide cyanobacteria and oxygenic photosynthesis splits with oxygen produced waste this process uses the atp and nadph produced the photosynthetic reaction centres described convert into glycerate phosphate which can then converted into this fixation reaction carried out the enzyme rubisco part the calvin benson cycle three types photosynthesis occur carbon fixation carbon fixation and cam photosynthesis these differ the route that carbon dioxide takes the calvin with plants fixing directly while and cam photosynthesis incorporate the into other compounds adaptations deal with intense sunlight and dry photosynthetic prokaryotes the mechanisms carbon fixation are more here carbon dioxide can fixed the benson reversed citric acid cycle the carboxylation prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix through the benson but use energy from inorganic compounds drive the carbohydrates and glycans gluconeogenesis glyoxylate cycle glycogenesis glycosylation carbohydrate simple organic acids can converted into monosaccharides such glucose and then used assemble polysaccharides such starch the generation glucose from compounds like pyruvate lactate glycerol glycerate phosphate and amino acids called gluconeogenesis gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate glucose phosphate through series many which are shared with glycolysis however this pathway not simply glycolysis run several steps are catalyzed glycolytic this important allows the formation and breakdown glucose regulated and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously futile cycle although fat common way storing vertebrates such humans the fatty acids these stores cannot converted glucose through gluconeogenesis these organisms cannot convert coa into pyruvate plants but animals have the necessary enzymatic after term vertebrates need produce ketone bodies from fatty acids replace glucose tissues such the brain that cannot metabolize fatty other organisms such plants and this metabolic problem solved using the glyoxylate cycle which bypasses the decarboxylation step the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation coa oxaloacetate where can used for the production polysaccharides and glycans are made the sequential addition monosaccharides glycosyltransferase from reactive phosphate donor such uridine diphosphate glucose acceptor hydroxyl group the growing any the hydroxyl groups the ring the substrate can the polysaccharides produced can have straight branched the polysaccharides produced can have structural metabolic functions transferred lipids and proteins enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases fatty isoprenoids and steroids fatty acid synthesis steroid metabolism steroid synthesis isopentenyl pyrophosphate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate geranyl pyrophosphate squalene fatty acids are made fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce coa the acyl chains the fatty acids are extended cycle reactions that add the acyl reduce dehydrate alkene group and then reduce again alkane group the enzymes fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out single multifunctional type while plant plastids and bacteria separate type enzymes perform each step the terpenes and isoprenoids are large class lipids that include the carotenoids and form the largest class plant natural products these compounds are made the assembly and modification isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate these precursors can made different animals and the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from while plants and bacteria the non mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde phosphate one important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors steroid biosynthesis here the isoprene units are joined together make squalene and then folded and formed into set rings make lanosterol lanosterol can then converted into other steroids such cholesterol and ergosterol proteins protein biosynthesis amino acid synthesis organisms vary their ability synthesize the common amino most bacteria and plants can synthesize all but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino nine essential amino acids must obtained from some simple parasites such the bacteria mycoplasma pneumoniae lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their all amino acids are synthesized from intermediates the citric acid the pentose phosphate nitrogen provided glutamate and glutamine amino acid synthesis depends the formation the appropriate keto which then transaminated form amino amino acids are made into proteins being joined together chain peptide bonds each different protein has unique sequence amino acid this its primary structure just the letters the alphabet can combined form almost endless variety amino acids can linked varying sequences form huge variety proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated attachment transfer rna molecule through ester bond this trna precursor produced atp dependent reaction carried out aminoacyl trna synthetase this trna then substrate for the ribosome which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein using the sequence information messenger rna nucleotide synthesis and salvage nucleotide salvage pyrimidine biosynthesis purine metabolism nucleotides are made from amino carbon dioxide and formic acid pathways that require large amounts metabolic consequently most organisms have efficient systems salvage preformed purines are synthesized nucleosides bases attached ribose both adenine and guanine are made from the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate which synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine glutamine and aspartic acid well formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate pyrimidines the other are synthesized from the base orotate which formed from glutamine and xenobiotics and redox metabolism xenobiotic metabolism drug metabolism alcohol metabolism antioxidants all organisms are constantly exposed compounds that they cannot use foods and would harmful they accumulated they have metabolic these potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics xenobiotics such synthetic drugs natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified set metabolizing these include cytochrome oxidases udp glucuronosyltransferases and glutathione transferases this system enzymes acts three stages firstly oxidize the xenobiotic phase and then conjugate soluble groups onto the molecule phase the modified soluble xenobiotic can then pumped out cells and multicellular organisms may further metabolized before being excreted phase ecology these reactions are particularly important microbial biodegradation pollutants and the bioremediation contaminated land and oil many these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular but due the incredible diversity types microbes these organisms are able deal with far wider range xenobiotics than multicellular and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such organochloride compounds related problem for aerobic organisms oxidative stress here processes including oxidative phosphorylation and the formation disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such hydrogen peroxide these damaging oxidants are removed antioxidant metabolites such glutathione and enzymes such catalases and peroxidases thermodynamics living organisms biological thermodynamics living organisms must obey the laws thermodynamics which describe the transfer heat and work the second law thermodynamics states that any closed system the amount entropy will tend although living amazing complexity appears contradict this life possible all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their thus living systems are not equilibrium but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state high complexity causing larger increase the entropy their the metabolism cell achieves this coupling the spontaneous processes catabolism the spontaneous processes thermodynamic terms metabolism maintains order creating regulation and control metabolic pathway metabolic control analysis hormone regulatory enzymes cell signaling the environments most organisms are constantly the reactions metabolism must finely regulated maintain constant set conditions within condition called homeostasis metabolic regulation also allows organisms respond signals and interact actively with their two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are firstly the regulation enzyme pathway how its activity increased and decreased response secondly the control exerted this enzyme the effect that these changes its activity have the overall rate the pathway the flux through the for enzyme may show large changes activity highly but these changes have little effect the flux metabolic then this enzyme not involved the control the effect insulin glucose uptake and plasma membrane glycogen glycolysis fatty acid there are multiple levels metabolic intrinsic the metabolic pathway regulates respond changes the levels substrates for decrease the amount product can increase the flux through the pathway this type regulation often involves allosteric regulation the activities multiple enzymes the extrinsic control involves cell multicellular organism changing its metabolism response signals from other these signals are usually the form soluble messengers such hormones and growth factors and are detected specific receptors the cell these signals are then transmitted inside the cell second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation very well understood example extrinsic control the regulation glucose metabolism the hormone insulin insulin produced response rises blood glucose levels binding the hormone insulin receptors cells then activates cascade protein kinases that cause the cells take glucose and convert into storage molecules such fatty acids and glycogen the metabolism glycogen controlled activity phosphorylase the enzyme that breaks down and glycogen synthase the enzyme that makes these enzymes are regulated reciprocal with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen but activating insulin causes glycogen synthesis activating protein phosphatases and producing decrease the phosphorylation these evolution molecular evolution phylogenetics evolutionary tree domains bacteria eukaryotes archaea phyla the central pathways metabolism described such glycolysis and the citric acid are present all three domains living things and were present the last universal ancestor this universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably methanogen that had extensive amino nucleotide carbohydrate and lipid the retention these ancient pathways during later evolution may the result these reactions having been optimal solution their particular metabolic with pathways such glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and minimal number mutation changes that affect coding dna segments may merely affect the metabolic efficiency the individual for whom the mutation the first pathways based metabolism may have been parts purine nucleotide while previous metabolic pathways were part the ancient rna world many models have been proposed describe the mechanisms which novel metabolic pathways these include the sequential addition novel enzymes short ancestral the duplication and then divergence entire pathways well the recruitment existing enzymes and their assembly into novel reaction the relative importance these mechanisms but genomic studies have shown that enzymes pathway are likely have shared suggesting that many pathways have evolved step fashion with novel functions created from existing steps the alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution structures metabolic this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively borrowing enzymes perform similar functions different metabolic pathways evident the manet database these recruitment processes result evolutionary enzymatic third possibility that some parts metabolism might exist modules that can reused different pathways and perform similar functions different well the evolution new metabolic evolution can also cause the loss metabolic for some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead scavenged from the host similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen endosymbiotic organisms investigation and manipulation protein methods proteomics metabolomics metabolic network modelling metabolic network arabidopsis thaliana citric acid cycle enzymes metabolites metabolism studied reductionist approach that focuses single metabolic particularly valuable the use radioactive tracers the tissue and cellular which define the paths from precursors final products identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and the enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then purified and their kinetics and responses inhibitors investigated parallel approach identify the small molecules cell the complete set these molecules called the metabolome overall these studies give good view the structure and function simple metabolic but are inadequate when applied more complex systems such the metabolism complete idea the complexity the metabolic networks cells that contain thousands different enzymes given the figure showing the interactions between just proteins and metabolites the the sequences genomes provide lists containing anything genes however now possible use this genomic data reconstruct complete networks biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their these models are especially powerful when used integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data gene expression from proteomic and dna microarray studies using these model human metabolism has now been which

example bow tie organization architecture able input wide range nutrients and produce large variety products and complex macromolecules using relatively few intermediate common major technological application this information metabolic engineering here organisms such yeast plants bacteria are genetically modified make them more useful biotechnology and aid the production drugs such antibiotics industrial chemicals such propanediol and shikimic acid these genetic modifications usually aim reduce the amount energy used produce the increase yields and reduce the production history history biochemistry history molecular biology santorio santorio ars statica medicina the term metabolism derived from the greek metabolismos for change overthrow the history the scientific study metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals early examining individual metabolic reactions modern the first controlled experiments human metabolism were published santorio santorio his book ars statica medicina described how weighed himself before and after sleep working sex fasting drinking and found that most the food took was lost through what called insensible these early the mechanisms these metabolic processes had not been identified and vital force was thought animate living the when studying the fermentation sugar alcohol yeast louis pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed substances within the yeast cells called ferments wrote that alcoholic fermentation act correlated with the life and organization the yeast not with the death putrefaction the this along with the publication friedrich hler paper the chemical synthesis urea and notable for being the first organic compound prepared from wholly inorganic this proved that the organic compounds and chemical reactions found cells were different principle than any other part was the discovery enzymes the beginning the century eduard buchner that separated the study the chemical reactions metabolism from the biological study and marked the beginnings biochemistry the mass biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early one the most prolific these modern biochemists was hans krebs who made huge contributions the study discovered the urea cycle and working with hans kornberg the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate modern biochemical research has been greatly
