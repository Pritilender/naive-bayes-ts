biology	mitosis navigation search meiosis miosis myositis myosotis animal cell chromosomes cell nucleus allium play media drosophila melanogaster embryo mitosis the the cell which cell duplicates into two genetically identical daughter chromosomes the cell nucleus are separated into two identical sets each its own mitosis followed immediately cytokinesis which divides the cytoplasm organelles and cell membrane and later which divides the dividing the cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares these cellular unreliable mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic phase the cell cycle the division the mother cell into two daughter genetically identical each other and their parent this accounts for approximately the cell mitosis occurs only eukaryotic cells and the process varies different for animals undergo open mitosis where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes while fungi such aspergillus nidulans and saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast undergo closed mitosis where chromosomes divide within intact cell nucleus prokaryotic cells which lack divide process called binary fission the process mitosis fast and highly the sequence events divided into stages corresponding the completion one set activities and the start the these stages are prophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase and telophase during the pairs chromatids condense and attach fibers that pull the sister chromatids opposite sides the the cell then divides cytokinesis produce two daughter because cytokinesis often occurs conjunction with mitosis often used interchangeably with mitotic however there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur forming single cells with multiple the most notable occurrence this among the fungi and slime molds but found various even cytokinesis and mitosis may occur for instance during certain stages fruit fly embryonic errors mitosis can either kill cell through apoptosis cause mutations certain types cancer can arise from such mitosis was discovered rabbit and cat cornea cells and described for the first time the polish histologist wac mayzel the term derived from the greek word mitos warp contents overview cell cycle

pictures see also references cited texts further reading external links overview cell cycle relation mitosis the primary result mitosis the transferring the parent genome into two daughter these two cells are identical and not differ any the genome composed number chromosomes complexes tightly coiled dna that contain genetic information vital for proper cell because each resultant daughter cell should genetically identical the parent the parent cell must make copy each chromatid before this occurs during the phase interphase the period that precedes the mitotic phase the cell cycle where preparation for mitosis the two identical chromatids resulting from chromatid duplication are called sister chromatids they are held together specialized region the dna sequence called the centromere mitosis begins when the chromosomes condense and become most eukaryotes the nuclear membrane which segregates the dna from the cytoplasm disintegrates into membrane the nucleolus which makes ribosomes the also the chromosomes align themselves line spanning the microtubules miniature splay out from opposite ends the cell and pulling apart the sister chromatids each sister chromatids this point are called daughter chromosomes the cell corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite new nuclear membrane forms around the separated daughter mitosis the cell begins animal cells the cell pinches inward where the imaginary line used the area the cell membrane that pinches form the two daughter cells called the cleavage furrow separating the two developing plant cells the daughter cells will construct dividing cell wall eventually the parent cell will split giving rise two daughter each with replica the original prokaryotic cells undergo process called binary which very much different from the process because there are nuclear dynamics and chromosomes clarification needed phases cell cycle and mitosis interphase interphase the mitotic phase relatively short period the cell cycle alternates with the much longer interphase where the cell prepares itself for the process cell interphase divided into three first and second during all three the cell grows producing proteins and cytoplasmic however chromosomes are replicated only during the phase thus cell grows continues grow duplicates its chromosomes grows more and prepares for mitosis and finally divides before restarting the all these phases the cell cycle are highly mainly via the phases follow one another strict order and there are checkpoints that give the cell the cues proceed from one phase there also fourth section interphase where the cell has the option enter cells continue through this cell cycle until they become too that point they will exit the cell cycle and enter this reaction called contact inhibition density dependent inhibition altogether interphase takes roughly preprophase plant preprophase plant cells prophase preceded prophase highly vacuolated plant the nucleus has migrate into the center the cell before mitosis can this achieved through the formation phragmosome transverse sheet cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane cell addition phragmosome preprophase characterized the formation ring microtubules and actin filaments called preprophase band underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane the future mitotic spindle this band marks the position where the cell will eventually the cells higher plants such the flowering plants lack centrioles instead microtubules form spindle the surface the nucleus and are then organized into spindle the chromosomes after the nuclear membrane the preprophase band disappears during nuclear membrane dissolution and spindle formation prophase prometaphase metaphase anaphase telophase cleavage furrow prophase prophase during this stage the cell prepares divide dissolving the membrane around the nucleus and the chromatin condenses into normally the genetic material the nucleus loosely bundled coil called chromatin the onset chromatin fibers become tightly condensing into discrete chromosomes crucial for the reader note that chromatin complex consisting both dna and specific since the genetic material has already been duplicated earlier the replicated chromosomes have two sister bound together the centromere the cohesin protein chromosomes are typically visible high magnification through light microscope also inside the the nucleolus the nucleus disappears from this noteworthy because the cell does not need divide the nucleolus right will later reform when the nucleus divides close the nucleus are structures called centrosomes consisting pair centrioles and halo microtubule centrioles are found most eukaryotic animal the centrosome the coordinating center for the microtubules cell inherits single centrosome cell which replicated the cell with the help the nucleus before new mitosis giving pair the two centrosomes nucleate microtubules which may thought cellular ropes form the spindle polymerizing soluble tubulin molecular motor proteins then push the centrosomes along these microtubules opposite sides the although centrioles help organize microtubule they are not essential for the formation the since they are absent from and centrosomes are not always used prometaphase prometaphase prometaphase sometimes included part the end prophase part early during early the nuclear membrane disintegrates and microtubules invade the nuclear this called open mitosis and occurs most multicellular fungi and some protists such algae trichomonads undergo variation called closed mitosis where the spindle forms inside the its microtubules are able penetrate the nuclear which stays late each chromosome forms two kinetochores its one attached each kinetochore complex protein structure that analogous ring for the microtubule the point where microtubules attach themselves the although the kinetochore structure and function are not fully known that contains some form molecular motor when microtubule connects with the the motor using energy from atp crawl the tube toward the originating this motor coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation provides the pulling force necessary later separate the two when the spindle grows sufficient kinetochore microtubules begin searching for kinetochores attach number nonkinetochore microtubules find and interact with corresponding nonkinetochore microtubules from the opposite centrosome form the mitotic the fishing pole the kinetochore would the hook that catches sister chromatid fish the centrosome acts the reel that draws the spindle fibers fishing also one the main phases mitosis because without cytokinesis would not able metaphase metaphase metaphase metaphase came from the greek word meaning after the microtubules have found and attached the kinetochores the two centrosomes start pulling the chromosomes through their attached centromeres towards the two ends the the chromosomes come under longitudinal tension from the two ends the the centromeres the some convene along the metaphase plate equatorial plane imaginary line that right between the two centrosome this line called the spindle this even alignment due the counterbalance the pulling powers generated the opposing analogous war between people equal certain types chromosomes not line the metaphase plate and instead move back and forth between the poles only roughly lining along the because proper chromosome separation requires that every kinetochore attached bundle microtubules spindle thought that unattached kinetochores generate signal prevent premature progression anaphase without all chromosomes being the signal creates the mitotic spindle checkpoint anaphase anaphase when every kinetochore attached cluster microtubules and the chromosomes have lined along the metaphase the cell proceeds anaphase from the greek word meaning two events then first the proteins that bind sister chromatids together are these sister chromatids now become separate daughter and are pulled apart shortening kinetochore microtubules and move toward the respective centrosomes which they are the cleaved centromeres first while the chromatids trail they all look they are trying grab their because they become shaped like next the polar microtubules pulling the centrosomes and the set chromosomes which they are apart opposite ends the the force that causes the centrosomes move toward the ends the cell still although there theory that suggests that the rapid assembly and breakdown microtubules may cause this the end anaphase the kinetochore microtubules all telophase telophase telophase from the greek word meaning end reversal prophase and prometaphase cleans the after effects the polar microtubules continue elongating the cell even corresponding daughter chromosomes attach opposite ends the new nuclear using the membrane vesicles the parent old nuclear forms around each set separated daughter chromosomes though the membrane does not enclose the and the nucleolus both sets now surrounded new begin relax decondense back into mitosis but cell division cytokinesis cleavage furrow cytokinesis cytokinesis often mistakenly thought the final part however cytokinesis separate process that begins the same time cytokinesis the technical even phase mitosis but rather separate necessary for completing cell animal cleavage furrow containing contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used pinching off the separated both animal and plant cell division also driven vesicles derived from the golgi apparatus which move along microtubules the middle the this structure coalesces into cell plate the center the phragmoplast and develops into cell separating the two the phragmoplast microtubule structure typical for higher whereas some green algae use phycoplast microtubule array during each daughter cell has complete copy the genome its parent the end cytokinesis marks the end the significance mitosis important for the maintenance the chromosomal each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike composition and equal number the chromosomes the
