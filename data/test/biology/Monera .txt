monera navigation search romanian hungarian blaj hadean scientific classification domains bacteria and archaea domain eukaryotes monera neer kingdom that contains unicellular organisms with prokaryotic cell organization having nuclear membrane such the taxon monera was first proposed phylum ernst haeckel subsequently the phylum was elevated the rank kingdom douard chatton the last commonly accepted classification with the taxon monera was the five kingdom classification system established robert whittaker under the three domain system taxonomy introduced carl woese which reflects the evolutionary history the organisms found kingdom monera have been divided into two domains archaea and bacteria with eukarya the third furthermore the taxon monera paraphyletic descended from common the term moneran the informal name members this group and still sometimes used the term prokaryote denote member either most bacteria were classified under monera cyanobacteria still often called the green were initially classified under plantae due their ability photosynthesize contents history haeckel classification subsequent classifications rise prominence three domain system blue green algae summary see also references external links history bacterial taxonomy classification generelle morphologie der organismen traditionally the natural world was classified vegetable mineral systema naturae after the development the microscope attempts were made fit microscopic organisms into either the plant animal antonie van leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and called them assigning them the class vermes the due the limited tools the sole references for this group were behaviour and habitat the description genera and their classification was extremely which was accentuated the perceived lack importance the ten years after the origin species ernst haeckel supporter proposed kingdom system which added the protista new kingdom that contained most microscopic one his eight major divisions protista was composed the monerans called moneres and defines them completely structureless and homogeneous consisting only piece haeckel monera included not only bacterial groups early discovery but also several small eukaryotic fact the genus vibrio the only bacterial genus explicitly assigned the while others are mentioned which led copeland speculate that haeckel considered all bacteria belong the genus ignoring other bacterial one notable exception were the members the modern phylum cyanobacteria such nostoc which were placed the phylum archephyta algae vide blue green algae the neolatin noun monera and the german noun moneres are derived from the ancient greek noun moneres which haeckel states mean simple however actually means solitary haeckel also describes the protist genus monas the two pages about monera his book the informal name member the monera was initially but later moneran was due its lack the phylum was not fully but the genera therein were divided into two die gymnomoneren envelope gymnomonera protogenes such protogenes primordialis unidentified amoeba and not bacterium protamaeba incorrectly fabricated species vibrio genus shaped bacteria first described bacterium genus shaped bacteria first described haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus the bacillus genus forming shaped bacteria first described haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus the monera spirochaeta thin shaped bacteria first described haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus the spirillum spiral shaped bacteria first described haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus the etc haeckel does provide comprehensive die lepomoneren with lepomonera protomonas identified synonym monas flagellated and not the name was reused for unrelated genus vampyrella now classed eukaryote and not subsequent classifications like the monera classification was not fully followed first and several different ranks were used and located with plants protists furthermore classification lacked specificity and was not exhaustive fact covers only few consequently lot confusion arose even the point that the monera did not contain bacterial genera and others according they were first recognized kingdom enderlein berlin the most popular scheme was created von geli who classified phototrophic bacteria the class the class schizomycetes was then emended walter migula along with the coinage the genus pseudomonas and this term was dominant use even reported robert earle buchanan had priority over other terms such however starting with ferdinand cohn the term bacteria german der became prominently used informally describe this group species without bacterium was fact genus created christian gottfried ehrenberg additionally cohn divided the bacteria according shape spherobacteria for the cocci microbacteria for the non filamentous rods desmobacteria for the filamentous rods and spirobacteria for the spiral successively cohn created the schizophyta plants which contained the photrophic bacteria the family schizomycetes and the phototrophic bacteria blue green the schizophyceae this union blue green algae and bacteria was much later followed who classified the two families revised phylum monera the stanier and van neil the main outlines bacterial bacteriol recognized the kingdom monera with phyla myxophyta and the latter comprising classes eubacteriae orders myxobacteriae order and spirochetae order bisset bacteria livingston london distinguished class and orders eubacteriales actinomycetales streptomycetales and orla jensen die hauptlinien des naturalischen bakteriensystems nebst einer ubersicht der zentr bakt parasitenk and bergey bergey manual determinative baltimore williams wilkins with many subsequent also presented rise prominence the term monera became well established the and when rightfully increase the importance the difference between species with nucleus and douard chatton divided all living organisms into two empires prokaryotes and the kingdom monera being the sole member the prokaryotes the anthropic importance the crown group plants and fungi was hard consequently several other megaclassification schemes ignored the empire rank but maintained the kingdom monera consisting such copeland and whittaker the latter classification system was widely which robert whittaker proposed five kingdom system for classification living whittaker system placed most single celled organisms into either the prokaryotic monera the eukaryotic the other three kingdoms his system were the eukaryotic animalia and whittaker however did not believe that all his kingdoms were whittaker subdiveded the kingdom into two branches containing several myxomonera cyanophyta now called cyanobacteria myxobacteria mastigomonera eubacteriae actinomycota spirochaetae alternative commonly followed subdivision systems were based gram this culminated the gibbons and murray classification gracilicutes gram photobacteria class oxyphotobacteriae water electron includes the order cyanobacteriales blue green now phylum and class anoxyphotobacteriae anaerobic orders rhodospirillales and chlorobiales scotobacteria now the proteobacteria and other gram negative nonphotosynthetic firmacutes gram subsequently corrected firmicutes several orders such bacillales and actinomycetales now the phylum mollicutes gram mycoplasma mendocutes uneven gram methanogenic now known the three domain system three domain system bacterial phyla pnas paper carl woese and george fox demonstrated that the archaea initially called are not significantly closer relationship the bacteria than they are eukaryotes the paper received page coverage the new york times and great controversy the conclusions have since become leading replacement the kingdom monera with the two kingdoms bacteria and archaea minority including thomas smith continue reject the widely accepted division between these two cavalier smith has published classifications which the archaebacteria are part subkingdom the kingdom blue green algae cyanobacteria although was generally accepted that one could distinguish prokaryotes from eukaryotes the basis the presence nucleus mitosis versus binary fission way size and other the monophyly the kingdom monera for that whether classification should according phylogeny was controversial for many although distinguishing between prokaryotes from eukaryotes fundamental distinction often credited paper douard chatton little noted until did not emphasize this distinction more than other biologists his roger stanier and van niel believed that the bacteria term which the time did not include blue green algae and the green algae had single conviction which culminated stanier writing letter think now quite evident that the green algae are not distinguishable from bacteria any fundamental feature their cellular other such pringsheim writing suspected separate origins for bacteria
