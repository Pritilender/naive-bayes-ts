square covered continuous body water that customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas more than half this area over meters deep average oceanic salinity around parts per thousand and nearly all seawater has salinity the range ppt though generally recognized several oceans these waters comprise one interconnected body salt water often referred the world ocean global this concept global ocean continuous body water with relatively free interchange among its parts fundamental importance oceanography the major oceanic divisions are defined part the continents various archipelagos and other these divisions are descending order the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the indian ocean the southern ocean and the arctic ocean rivers columbia river oregon washington hawaii river river natural watercourse usually freshwater flowing toward ocean lake sea another few river simply flows into the ground dries completely before reaching another body small rivers may also termed several other including stream creek and the united states river generally classified watercourse more than feet metres wide the water river usually channel made stream bed between banks larger rivers there also wider floodplain shaped waters topping the flood plains may very wide relation the size the river rivers are part the hydrological cycle water within river generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff groundwater recharge springs and the release water stored glaciers and streams stream stream flowing body water with current confined within bed and stream banks streams play important corridor role connecting fragmented habitats and thus conserving biodiversity the study streams and waterways general known surface hydrology types streams include creeks tributaries which not reach ocean and connect with another stream brooks which are typically small streams and sometimes sourced from spring seep and tidal lakes car lake lake glacial province argentina swamp everglades national park florida usa lake lake from latin lacus terrain feature body water that localized the bottom basin body water considered lake when not part ocean larger and deeper than pond and fed natural lakes earth are generally found mountainous areas rift zones and areas with ongoing recent glaciation other lakes are found endorheic basins along the courses mature some parts the there are many lakes because chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age all lakes are temporary over geologic time they will slowly fill with sediments spill out the basin containing ponds pond pond body standing water either natural that usually smaller than lake wide variety made bodies water are classified including water gardens designed for aesthetic fish ponds designed for commercial fish and solar ponds designed store thermal ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed while currents streams are easily ponds and lakes possess thermally driven currents and moderate wind driven these features distinguish pond from many other aquatic terrain such stream pools and tide pools atmosphere climate and weather scatter blue light

the amount ultraviolet radiation that reaches the dna readily damaged this serves protect life the the atmosphere also retains heat during the thereby reducing the daily temperature atmospheric layers earth atmosphere principal layers earth atmosphere can divided into five main these layers are mainly determined whether temperature increases decreases with from highest these layers exosphere the outermost layer atmosphere extends from the exobase mainly composed hydrogen and helium thermosphere the top the thermosphere the bottom the called the exobase its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about the international space station orbits this between and and mesosphere the mesosphere extends from the stratopause the layer where most meteors burn upon entering the stratosphere the stratosphere extends from the tropopause about the stratopause which the boundary between the stratosphere and typically troposphere the troposphere begins the surface and extends between the poles and the with some variation due the troposphere mostly heated transfer energy from the average the lowest part the troposphere warmest and temperature decreases with the tropopause the boundary between the troposphere and within the five principal layers determined temperature are several layers determined other the ozone layer contained within the mainly located the lower portion the stratosphere from about though the thickness varies seasonally and about the ozone our atmosphere contained the the ionosphere the part the atmosphere that ionized solar stretches from and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the forms the inner edge the the homosphere and heterosphere the homosphere includes the stratosphere and the upper part the heterosphere composed almost completely the lightest the planetary boundary layer the part the troposphere that nearest the surface and directly affected mainly through turbulent diffusion effects global warming aletsch glacier

atmosphere weather weather set all the phenomena occurring given atmospheric area given time most weather phenomena occur the troposphere just below the stratosphere weather generally day temperature and precipitation whereas climate the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods when used without weather understood the weather earth weather occurs due density temperature and differences between one place and these differences can occur due the sun angle any particular which varies latitude from the the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise the jet stream weather systems the mid latitudes such extratropical cyclones are caused instabilities the jet stream because the axis tilted relative its orbital sunlight incident different angles
