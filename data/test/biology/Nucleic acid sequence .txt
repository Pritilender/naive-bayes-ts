challenged and march mrna nucleotides amino acid nucleic acid sequence succession letters that indicate the order nucleotides within dna using rna molecule sequences are usually presented from the end the end because nucleic acids are normally linear polymers specifying the sequence equivalent defining the covalent structure the entire for this the nucleic acid sequence also termed the primary structure the sequence has capacity represent information biological dna represents the information which directs the functions living that the term genetic sequence often sequences can read from the biological raw material through dna sequencing methods nucleic acids also have secondary structure and tertiary structure primary structure sometimes mistakenly referred primary sequence conversely there parallel concept secondary tertiary contents nucleotides notation biological significance sequence determination digital representation sequence analysis genetic testing sequence alignment sequence motifs see also references external links nucleotides nucleotide nucleic acids consist chain linked units called each nucleotide consists three phosphate group and sugar ribose the case rna deoxyribose dna make the backbone the nucleic acid and attached the sugar one set nucleobases the nucleobases are important base pairing strands form level secondary and tertiary structure such the famed double helix the possible letters are and representing the four nucleotide bases dna strand adenine cytosine guanine thymine covalently linked phosphodiester backbone the typical the sequences are printed abutting one another without the sequence read left right the direction with regards transcription sequence the coding strand has the same order the transcribed one sequence can complementary another meaning that they have the base each position the complementary and the reverse for the complementary sequence ttac one strand the stranded dna considered the sense strand then the other considered the antisense will have the complementary sequence the sense notation nucleic acid notation while and represent particular nucleotide there are also letters that represent ambiguity which are used when more than one kind nucleotide could occur that the rules the international union pure and applied chemistry iupac are adenine cytosine guanine thymine strong weak all but all but all but all but these symbols are also valid for except with replacing apart from adenine cytosine guanine thymine and uracil dna and rna also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been the most common modified base methylcytidine there are many modified including pseudouridine dihydrouridine inosine ribothymidine and methylguanosine hypoxanthine and xanthine are two the many bases created through mutagen presence both them through deamination replacement the group with hypoxanthine produced from adenine xanthine from guanine similarly deamination cytosine results uracil biological significance genetic code nucleic acids translated amino acid proteins genetic code central dogma molecular biology biological nucleic acids contain information which used living cell construct specific proteins the sequence nucleobases nucleic acid strand translated cell machinery into sequence amino acids making protein each group three called codon corresponds single amino and there specific genetic code which each possible combination three bases corresponds specific amino the central dogma molecular biology outlines the mechanism which proteins are constructed using information contained nucleic dna transcribed into mrna molecules which travels the ribosome where the mrna used template for the construction the protein since nucleic acids can bind molecules with complementary sequences there distinction between sense sequences which code for and the complementary antisense sequence which itself but can bind the sense sequence determination dna sequencing dna sequencing the process determining the nucleotide sequence given dna fragment the sequence the dna living thing encodes the necessary information for that living thing survive and therefore determining the sequence useful fundamental research into why and how organisms well applied because the importance dna living knowledge dna sequence may useful practically any biological research for medicine can used diagnose and potentially develop treatments for genetic diseases similarly research into pathogens may lead treatments for contagious biotechnology burgeoning with the potential for many useful products and rna not sequenced instead copied dna reverse transcriptase and this dna then current sequencing methods rely the discriminatory ability dna and therefore can only distinguish four inosine created from adenosine during rna editing read and cytosine created from cytosine dna methylation read with current difficult sequence small amounts the signal too weak this overcome polymerase chain reaction amplification digital representation once nucleic acid sequence has been obtained from stored silico digital digital genetic sequences may stored sequence databases analyzed see sequence analysis below digitally altered and used templates for creating new actual dna using artificial gene synthesis sequence analysis sequence analysis digital genetic sequences may analyzed using the tools bioinformatics attempt determine its genetic testing genetic testing the dna genome can analyzed diagnose vulnerabilities inherited diseases and can also used determine paternity genetic ancestry normally every person carries two variations every gene one inherited from their the other inherited from their the human genome believed contain around genes addition studying chromosomes the level individual genetic testing broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence genetic diseases mutant forms genes associated with increased risk developing genetic genetic testing identifies changes genes usually testing used find changes that are associated with inherited the results genetic test can confirm rule out suspected genetic condition help determine chance developing passing genetic several hundred genetic tests are currently and more are being sequence alignment sequence alignment sequence alignment way arranging the sequences dna rna protein identify regions similarity that may due structural evolutionary relationships between the two sequences alignment share common mismatches can interpreted point mutations and gaps insertion deletion mutations indels introduced one both lineages the time since they diverged from one sequence alignments the degree similarity between amino acids occupying particular position the sequence can interpreted rough measure how conserved particular region sequence motif among the absence the presence only very conservative substitutions that the substitution amino acids whose side chains have similar biochemical particular region the suggest that this region has structural functional although dna and rna nucleotide bases are more similar each other than are amino the conservation base pairs can indicate similar functional structural computational phylogenetics makes extensive use sequence alignments the construction and interpretation phylogenetic trees which are used classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous genes represented the genomes divergent the degree which sequences query set differ qualitatively related the evolutionary distance from one roughly high sequence identity suggests that the sequences question have comparatively young most recent common ancestor while low identity suggests that the divergence more this which reflects the molecular clock hypothesis that roughly constant rate evolutionary change can used extrapolate the elapsed time since two genes first diverged that the coalescence time assumes that the effects mutation and selection are constant across sequence therefore does not account for possible difference among organisms species the rates dna repair the possible functional conservation specific regions the case nucleotide the molecular clock hypothesis its most basic form also discounts the difference acceptance rates between silent mutations that not alter the meaning given codon and other mutations that result different amino acid being incorporated into the more statistically accurate methods allow the evolutionary rate each branch the phylogenetic tree thus producing better estimates
