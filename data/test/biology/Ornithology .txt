concerns the study birds etymologically the word ornithology derives from the ancient greek ornis bird and logos rationale explanation several aspects ornithology differ from related due partly the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal most marked among these the extent studies undertaken amateurs working within the parameters strict scientific the science ornithology has long history and studies birds have helped develop several key concepts behaviour and ecology such the definition species the process speciation instinct learning ecological niches guilds island biogeography phylogeography and conservation while early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions ornithologists today seek answers very specific often using birds models test hypotheses predictions based most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups and the number professional scientists who identify themselves ornithologists has therefore wide range tools and techniques are used both inside the laboratory and out the and innovations are constantly contents etymology history early knowledge and study scientific studies rise popularity techniques collections the field the laboratory collaborative studies applications see also references additional sources further reading external links etymology the origins the word ornithology come from the greek ornithologos and late century latin ornithologia meaning bird history timeline ornithology the history ornithology largely reflects the trends the history biology well many other scientific including ecology anatomy physiology paleontology and more recently molecular trends include the move from mere descriptions the identification and thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these early knowledge and study book birds humans have had observational relationship with birds since prehistory with some stone age drawings being amongst the oldest indications interest birds were perhaps important food and bones many species have been found excavations early stone age settlements waterbird and seabird remains have also been found shell mounds the island oronsay off the coast scotland cultures around the world have rich vocabularies related traditional bird names are often based detailed knowledge the with many names being onomatopoeic many still traditional knowledge may also involve the use birds folk medicine and knowledge these practices are passed through oral traditions see ethno ornithology hunting wild birds well their domestication would have required considerable knowledge their poultry farming and falconry were practised from early times many parts the artificial incubation poultry was practised china around and around least the egyptians also made use birds their hieroglyphic many though are still identifiable ulisse aldrovandi early written records provide valuable information the past distributions for instance xenophon records the abundance the ostrich assyria this subspecies from asia minor extinct and all extant ostrich races are today restricted africa other old writings such the vedas demonstrate the careful observation avian life histories and includes the earliest reference the habit brood parasitism the asian koel eudynamys scolopacea like the early art japan persia and india also demonstrate with examples scientifically accurate bird aristotle his historia animalium noted the habit bird migration moulting egg laying and life well compiling list different bird however also introduced and propagated several such the idea that swallows hibernated although noted that cranes migrated from the steppes scythia the marshes the headwaters the nile the idea swallow hibernation became well established even late elliott coues could list many contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation swallows and little published evidence contradict the similar misconceptions existed regarding the breeding barnacle their nests had not been seen and was believed that they grew transformations goose barnacles idea that became prevalent from around the century and noted bishop giraldus cambrensis gerald wales topographia hiberniae around pliny the elder described among other his historia naturalis the origins falconry have been traced mesopotamia and the earliest record comes from the reign sargon falconry made its entry europe only after brought from the east after invasions the huns and frederick hohenstaufen learnt about arabian falconry during wars the region and obtained arabic treatise falconry moamyn had this work translated into latin and also conducted experiments birds his menagerie sealing the eyes vultures and placing food concluded that they found food and not also developed methods keep and train the studies that undertook over nearly years were published arte venandi cum avibus the art hunting with considered one the earliest studies bird and the first work known include illustrations several early german and french scholars compiled old works and conducted new research these included guillaume rondelet who described his observations the mediterranean and pierre belon who described the fish and birds that had seen france and the belon book birds folio volume with descriptions some two hundred his comparison the skeleton humans and birds considered landmark comparative anatomy volcher coiter dutch anatomist made detailed studies the internal structures birds and produced classification diferentiis avium around that was based structure and konrad gesner wrote the vogelbuch and icones avium omnium around like ulisse aldrovandi encyclopedic naturalist began volume natural history with three volumes entitled ornithologiae hoc est avibus historiae libri xii which was published from aldrovandi showed great interest plants and animals and his work included drawings flowers plants and published volumes his ornithology alone covers pages and included such aspects the chicken and poultry used number traits including particularly bathing and classify bird aviculture william turner historia avium history published cologne was early ornithological work from noted the commonness kite english cities where they snatched food out the hands included folk beliefs such those anglers believed that the osprey emptied their fishponds and would kill mixing the flesh the osprey into their fish turner work reflected the violent times that lived and stands contrast later works such gilbert white the natural history and antiquities selborne that were written tranquil the century francis willughby and john ray came with the first major system bird classification that was based function and morphology rather than form willughby ornithologiae libri tres completed john ray sometimes considered mark the beginning scientific ray also worked ornithologia which was published posthumously synopsis methodica avium piscium the earliest list british pinax rerum naturalium britannicarum was written christopher merrett however was not considered value many including john experiment bird the air pump towards the late mathurin jacques brisson and comte buffon began new works brisson produced volume work ornithologie and included nine volumes volumes birds histoire naturelle des oiseaux his work science histoire naturelle rale coenraad jacob temminck sponsored fran ois vaillant collect bird specimens africa and this resulted volume histoire naturelle des oiseaux afrique louis jean pierre vieillot spent ten years studying north american birds and wrote the histoire naturelle des oiseaux amerique septentrionale vieillot pioneered the use histories and habits alexander wilson composed volume american published the first such record north american significantly predating the early lewis and clark studied and identified many birds the western united john james audubon born observed and painted birds france and later the ohio and mississippi valleys from audubon published the birds america which was engraved robert and his son robert containing engravings often regarded the greatest ornithological work scientific studies the emergence ornothology scientific discipline began the century when mark catesby published his volume natural history florida and the bahama islands landmark work which included hand painted engravings and was the basis for many the species carolus linnaeus described the systema naturae linnaeus work revolutionised bird taxonomy assigning every species binomial name categorising them into different however was not until the victorian with the concept natural and the collection natural objects such bird eggs and that ornithology emerged specialised this specialization led the formation britain the british union the members founded its journal the ibis the sudden spurt ornithology was also due part colonialism hundred years moreau noted that ornithology this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions various species doubt the preoccupation with widely extended geographical was fostered the immensity the areas over which british rule influence stretched during the century and for some time the bird collectors the victorian era observed the variations bird forms and habits across geographic noting local specialization and variation widespread the collections museums and private collectors grew with contributions from various parts the the naming species with binomials and the organization birds into groups based their similarities became the main work museum the variations widespread birds across geographical region caused the introduction trinomial the search for patterns the variations birds was attempted friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling his student johann baptist von spix and several others believed that there was hidden and innate mathematical order the forms they believed that there was natural classification that was superior artificial ones particularly popular idea was the quinarian system popularised nicholas aylward vigors william sharp macleay william swainson and the idea was that nature followed rule with five groups nested some had attempted rule but johann jakob kaup insisted that the number five was special noting that other natural entities such the senses also came followed this idea and demonstrated his view the order within the crow where failed find genera left blank insisting that new genus would found fill these these ideas were replaced more complex maps affinities works hugh edwin strickland and alfred russel wallace the galapagos finches were especially influential the development charles darwin theory his contemporary alfred russel wallace also noted these variations and the geographical separations between different forms leading the study biogeography wallace was influenced the work philip lutley sclater the distribution patterns quinarian system for the problem was how species arose from common but did not attempt find rules for delineation the species problem was tackled the ornithologist ernst mayr mayr was able demonstrate that geographical isolation and the accumulation genetic differences led the splitting early ornithologists were preoccupied with matters species only systematics counted true science and field studies were considered inferior through much the robert ridgway wrote the introduction the birds north and middle america that there are two essentially different kinds systematic and the former deals with the structure and classification their synonymies and technical the latter treats their songs nesting and other facts pertaining their life this early idea that the study living birds was merely recreation held sway until ecological theories became the predominant focus ornithological the study birds their habitats was particularly advanced germany with bird ringing stations established early the the journal ornithologie included many papers the ecology anatomy and many written erwin stresemann stresemann changed the editorial policy the leading both unification field and laboratory studies and shift research from museums ornithology the united states continued dominated museum studies morphological species identities and geographic until was influenced student ernst some the earliest ornithological works that used the word ecology appeared the ibis however resisted the introduction these new methods study and was not until that any paper ecology the work david lack population ecology was newer quantitative approaches were introduced for the study ecology and behaviour and this was not readily for claud ticehurst wrote sometimes seems that elaborate plans and statistics are made prove what commonplace knowledge the mere such that hunting parties often travel more less david studies population ecology sought find the processes involved the regulation population based the evolution optimal clutch concluded that population was regulated primarily density dependent controls and also suggested that natural selection produces history traits that maximize the fitness others like wynne edwards interpreted population regulation mechanism that aided the species rather than individuals this led widespread and sometimes bitter debate what constituted the unit lack also pioneered the use many new tools for ornithological including the idea using radar study bird birds were also widely used studies the niche hypothesis and georgii gause competitive exclusion principle work resource partitioning and the structuring bird communities through competition were made robert macarthur patterns biodiversity also became topic work the relationship the number species area and its application the study island biogeography was pioneered wilson and robert macarthur these studies led the development the discipline landscape ecology red footed falcon john hurrell crook studied the behaviour weaverbirds and demonstrated the links between ecological behaviour and social principles from economics were introduced the study biology jerram brown his work explaining territorial this led more studies behaviour that made use benefit the rising interest sociobiology also led spurt bird studies this the study imprinting behaviour ducks and geese konrad lorenz and the studies instinct herring gulls nicolaas tinbergen led the establishment the field ethology the study learning became area interest and the study bird song has been model for studies the role hormones and physiology the control behaviour has also been aided bird these have helped the study circadian and seasonal studies migration have attempted answer questions the evolution orientation and the growth genetics and the rise molecular biology led the application the gene centered view evolution explain avian studies kinship and such helpers became particular the idea inclusive fitness was used interpret observations behaviour and history and birds were widely used models for testing hypotheses based theories postulated hamilton and the new tools biology changed the study bird systematics changed from being based phenotype the underlying genotype the use techniques such dna dna hybridization study evolutionary relationships was pioneered charles sibley and jon edward ahlquist resulting what called the sibley ahlquist taxonomy these early techniques have been replaced newer ones based mitochondrial dna sequences and molecular phylogenetics approaches that make use computational procedures for sequence alignment construction phylogenetic trees and calibration molecular clocks infer evolutionary molecular techniques are also widely used studies avian population biology and rise popularity the use field glasses telescopes for bird observation began the and with pioneers like dovaston who also pioneered the use but was not until the that instruction manuals began insist the use optical aids such class field florence augusta merriam bailey the rise field guides for the identification birds was another major the early guides such those thomas bewick volumes and william yarrell volumes were and mainly focused identifying specimens the the earliest the new generation field guides was prepared florence merriam sister clinton hart merriam the this was published series hints audubon fifty birds and how know them audubon magazine these were followed new field guides including classics roger tory peterson the interest birdwatching grew popularity many parts the world and was realized that there was possibility for amateurs contribute biological early julian huxley wrote two part article the auk noting the tensions between amateurs and professionals and suggested the possibility that the vast army lovers and watchers could begin providing the data scientists needed address the fundamental problems organizations were started many countries and these grew rapidly most notable among them being the royal society for the protection birds britain and the audubon society the the audubon society started both these organizations were started with the primary objective the born grew from small group women croydon who met regularly and called themselves the fur fin and feather folk and who took pledge refrain from wearing the feathers any birds not killed for the purpose the ostrich only the organization did not allow men members avenging policy the british union keep out unlike the which was primarily conservation the british trust for ornithology was started with the aim advancing ornithological members were often involved collaborative ornithological these projects have resulted atlases which detail the distribution bird species across the united the breeding bird conducted the geological survey have also produced atlases with information breeding densities and changes the density and distribution over other volunteer collaborative ornithology projects were subsequently established other parts the techniques the tools and techniques ornithology are varied and new inventions and approaches are quickly the techniques may broadly dealt under the categories those that are applicable specimens and those that are used the however the classification rough and many analysis techniques are usable both the laboratory and field may require combination field and laboratory collections bird collections the earliest approaches modern bird study involved the collection practice known oology while collecting became pastime for many the labels associated with these early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study bird order preserve tiny hole was pierced and the contents this technique became standard with the invention the blow drill around egg collection longer however historic museum collections have been value determining the effects pesticides such ddt museum bird collections continue act resource for taxonomic the use bird skins document species has been standard part systematic bird skins are prepared retaining the key bones the leg and skull along with the skin and the they were treated with arsenic prevent fungal and insect mostly dermestid attack arsenic being was replaced borax amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending their skins some them from distant this led the formation huge collections bird skins museums europe and north many private collections were also these became references for comparison species and the ornithologists these museums were able compare species from different often places that they themselves never morphometrics these particularly the lengths the bill tail and wing became important the descriptions bird these skin collections have been utilized more recent times for studies molecular phylogenetics the extraction ancient dna the importance type specimens the description species make skin collections vital resource for systematic however with the rise molecular has now become possible establish the taxonomic status new such the bulo burti boubou laniarius liberatus longer valid and the bugun liocichla liocichla bugunorum using dna and feather samples the holotype material other methods preservation include the storage specimens such specimens have special value physiological and anatomical apart from providing better quality dna for molecular freeze drying specimens another technique that has the advantage preserving stomach contents and although tends shrink making less reliable for the field the study birds the field was helped enormously improvements photography made possible document birds the field with great high power spotting scopes today allow observers detect minute morphological differences that were earlier possible only examination the specimen the hand mist net the capture and marking birds enables detailed studies techniques for capturing birds are varied and include the use bird liming for perching mist nets for woodland cannon netting for open area flocking the bal chatri trap for decoys and funnel traps for water californian condor the bird the hand may examined and measurements can made including standard lengths and feather moult and skull ossification provide indications age and sex can determined examination anatomy some sexually dimorphic blood samples may drawn determine hormonal conditions studies identify dna markers for studying genetics and kinship studies breeding biology and blood may also used pathogens and arthropod borne viruses ectoparasites may collected for studies coevolution and zoonoses many cryptic measurements such the relative lengths wing feathers are vital establishing captured birds are often marked for future rings bands provide lasting identification but require capture for the information them field identifiable marks such coloured wing tags dyes enable term studies where individual identification mark and recapture techniques make demographic studies ringing has traditionally been used the study recent times satellite transmitters provide the ability track migrating birds near techniques for estimating population density include point counts transects and territory observations are made the field using carefully designed protocols and the data may analysed estimate bird relative abundance absolute population these methods may used repeatedly over large time spans monitor changes the camera traps have been found useful tool for the detection and documentation elusive nest predators and the quantitative analysis seed dispersal and the laboratory many aspects bird biology are difficult study the these include the study behavioural and physiological changes that require long duration access the non destructive samples blood feathers taken during field studies may studied the for the variation the ratios stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes possible roughly establish the origins migrant birds using mass spectrometric analysis feather these techniques can used combination with other techniques such the first attenuated vaccine developed louis pasteur was for fowl cholera and was tested poultry poultry continues used model for many studies mammalian studies bird behaviour include the use tamed and trained birds studies bird intelligence and song learning have been largely laboratory field researchers may make use wide range techniques such the use dummy owls elicit mobbing dummy males the use call playback elicit territorial behaviour and thereby establish the boundaries bird studies bird migration including aspects orientation and physiology are often studied using captive birds special cages that record their the emlen funnel for instance makes use cage with inkpad the centre and conical floor where the ink marks can counted identify the direction which the bird attempts the funnel can have transparent top and visible cues such the direction sunlight may controlled using mirrors the positions the stars simulated planetarium the entire genome the domestic fowl gallus gallus was sequenced and was followed the genome the zebra finch taeniopygia guttata such whole genome sequencing projects allow for studies evolutionary processes involved speciation associations between the expression genes and behaviour may studied using candidate variations the exploratory behaviour great tits parus major have been found linked with gene orthologous the human gene drd dopamine receptor which known associated with seeking the role gene expression developmental differences and morphological variations have been studied darwin finches the difference the expression bmp have been shown associated with changes the growth and shape the the chicken has long been model organism for studying vertebrate developmental biology the embryo readily its development can easily followed unlike mice this also allows the use electroporation for studying the effect adding silencing other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken embryonic stem cells and viral vectors collaborative studies canada goose with the widespread interest has been possible use large number people work collaborative ornithological projects that cover large geographic these citizen science projects include wide projects such the christmas bird count backyard bird count the north american breeding bird survey the canadian epoq regional projects such the asian waterfowl census and spring alive these projects help identify distributions their population densities and changes over arrival and departure dates breeding seasonality and even population the results many these projects are published bird atlases studies migration using bird ringing colour marking often involve the cooperation people and organizations different applications bird strike bird conservation wild birds impact many human activities while domesticated birds are important sources meat feathers and other applied and economic ornithology aim reduce the ill effects problem birds and enhance gains from beneficial red billed quelea the role some species birds pests has been well particularly granivorous birds such the queleas africa are among the most numerous birds the world and foraging flocks can cause many insectivorous birds are also noted beneficial many early studies the benefits damages caused birds fields were made analysis stomach contents and observation feeding modern studies aimed manage birds agriculture make use wide range principles from intensive aquaculture has brought humans conflict with eating birds such cormorants large flocks pigeons and starlings cities are often considered nuisance and techniques reduce their populations their impacts are constantly birds are also medical importance and their role carriers human diseases such japanese encephalitis west nile virus and have been widely bird strikes and the damage they cause aviation are particularly great due the fatal consequences and the level economic losses has been estimated that the airline industry incurs worldwide damages billion each many species birds have been driven extinction human being conspicuous elements the they have been considered indicators ecological they have also helped gathering support for habitat conservation bird conservation requires specialized knowledge aspects ecology and may require the use very location specific
