photosynthesis navigation search phytoplankton vegetation photosynthesis process used plants and other organisms convert light energy normally from the sun into chemical energy that can later released fuel the activities this chemical energy stored carbohydrate molecules such sugars which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name from the greek light and synthesis putting most oxygen also released waste most plants most algae and cyanobacteria perform and such organisms are called photoautotrophs photosynthesis maintains atmospheric oxygen levels and supplies all the organic compounds and most the energy necessary for life although photosynthesis performed differently different the process always begins when energy from light absorbed proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts which are most abundant leaf while bacteria they are embedded the plasma membrane these dependent some energy used strip electrons from suitable substances such producing oxygen furthermore two further compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine triphosphate the energy algae and sugars are produced subsequent sequence independent reactions called the calvin cycle but some bacteria use different such the reverse krebs cycle the calvin atmospheric carbon dioxide incorporated into already existing organic carbon such ribulose bisphosphate using the atp and nadph produced the dependent the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed form further carbohydrates such glucose the first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early the evolutionary history life and most likely used reducing agents such hydrogen hydrogen sulfide sources rather than cyanobacteria appeared and the excess oxygen they produced contributed the oxygen catastrophe which rendered the evolution complex life possible today the average rate energy capture photosynthesis globally approximately terawatts which about six times larger than the current power consumption human civilization photosynthetic organisms also convert around thousand

factors light intensity wavelength and temperature carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration see also references further reading books papers external links overview photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs which means that they are able synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from however not all organisms that use light source energy carry out since photoheterotrophs use organic rather than carbon source algae and photosynthesis releases this called oxygenic photosynthesis although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis plants algae and cyanobacteria the overall process quite similar these however there are some types bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis which consumes carbon dioxide but does not release carbon dioxide converted into sugars process called carbon fixation carbon fixation endothermic redox reaction photosynthesis needs supply both source energy drive this and the electrons needed convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrate this addition the electrons reduction reaction general outline and photosynthesis the opposite cellular respiration which glucose and other compounds are oxidized produce carbon dioxide and and release exothermic chemical energy drive the metabolism however the two processes take place through different sequence chemical reactions and different cellular the general equation for photosynthesis photons carbon dioxide electron donor light energy carbohydrate oxidized electron donor oxygenic photosynthesis water the electron donor since its hydrolysis releases the equation for this process photons often water molecules are cancelled both yielding photons other processes substitute other compounds such arsenite for water the supply for example some microbes use sunlight oxidize arsenite arsenate the equation for this reaction photosynthesis occurs two the first light dependent reactions light reactions capture the energy light and use make the storage molecules atp and nadph during the second the light independent reactions use these products capture and reduce carbon most organisms that utilize photosynthesis produce oxygen use visible light although least three use shortwave infrared more far red photosynthetic membranes and organelles chloroplast thylakoid photosynthetic the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded within cell membranes which the simplest configuration these proteins are however this membrane may tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids bunched into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes these structures can fill most the interior giving the membrane very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount light that the bacteria can plants and photosynthesis takes place organelles called chloroplasts typical plant cell contains about chloroplasts the chloroplast enclosed this membrane composed phospholipid inner phospholipid outer and intermembrane space between within the membrane aqueous fluid called the the stroma contains stacks which are the site the thylakoids are flattened bounded membrane with lumen thylakoid space within the site photosynthesis the thylakoid which contains integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes including the pigments that absorb light which form the plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll which the reason that most plants have green besides plants also use pigments such carotenes and xanthophylls algae also use but various other pigments are present phycocyanin carotenes and xanthophylls green algae phycoerythrin red algae and fucoxanthin brown algae and diatoms resulting wide variety these pigments are embedded plants and algae special such proteins all the pigments are ordered work well such protein also called light harvesting complex although all cells the green parts plant have most the energy captured the leaves except certain species adapted conditions strong sunlight and aridity such many euphorbia and cactus species whose main photosynthetic organs are their the cells the interior tissues called the mesophyll can contain between and chloroplasts for every square millimeter the surface the leaf uniformly coated with resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation water and decreases the absorption ultraviolet blue light reduce heating the transparent epidermis layer allows light pass through the palisade mesophyll cells where most the photosynthesis takes light reactions dependent reactions the light reactions one molecule the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron this electron passed modified form chlorophyll called pheophytin which passes the electron quinone molecule allowing the start flow electrons down electron transport chain that leads the ultimate reduction nadp nadph this creates proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane its dissipation used atp synthase for the concomitant synthesis atp the chlorophyll molecule regains the lost electron from water molecule through process called photolysis which releases dioxygen molecule the overall equation for the dependent reactions under the conditions cyclic electron flow green plants not all wavelengths light can support the photosynthetic action spectrum depends the type accessory pigments present for green the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with peaks for blue and red red the action spectrum overlaps with the absorption spectrum phycobilins for red green which allows these algae grow deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths used green the absorbed part the light spectrum what gives photosynthetic organisms their color green red purple and the least effective for photosynthesis the respective scheme light dependent reactions occur the thylakoid membranes the chloroplasts and use light energy synthesize atp and the dependent reaction has two cyclic and the cyclic the photons are captured the harvesting antenna complexes photosystem chlorophyll and other accessory pigments see diagram when chlorophyll molecule the core the photosystem reaction center obtains sufficient excitation energy from the adjacent antenna electron transferred the primary acceptor pheophytin through process called photoinduced charge separation these electrons are shuttled through electron transport chain the called scheme shown the that initially functions generate chemiosmotic potential across the atp synthase enzyme uses the chemiosmotic potential make atp during whereas nadph product the terminal redox reaction the scheme the electron enters chlorophyll molecule photosystem the electron excited due the light absorbed the photosystem second electron carrier accepts the which again passed down lowering energies electron acceptors the energy created the electron acceptors used move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the the electron used reduce the enzyme which has functions the independent the cyclic reaction similar that the but differs the form that generates only and reduced nadp the cyclic reaction takes place only photosystem once the electron displaced from the the electron passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns photosystem from where was hence the name cyclic reaction water photolysis photodissociation oxygen evolution the nadph the main reducing agent providing source energetic electrons other its production leaves chlorophyll with deficit electrons which must obtained from some other reducing the excited electrons lost from chlorophyll photosystem are replaced from the electron transport chain plastocyanin however since photosystem includes the first steps the scheme external source electrons required reduce its oxidized chlorophyll molecules the source electrons plant and cyanobacterial photosynthesis two water molecules are oxidized four successive separation reactions photosystem yield molecule diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions the electron yielded each step transferred active tyrosine residue that then reduces the photoxidized chlorophyll species called that serves the primary electron donor the photosystem reaction the oxidation water catalyzed photosystem active structure that contains four manganese ions and calcium this oxygen evolving complex binds two water molecules and stores the four oxidizing equivalents that are required drive the oxidizing photosystem the only known biological enzyme that carries out this oxidation the hydrogen ions contribute the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads atp oxygen waste product dependent but the majority organisms earth use oxygen for cellular respiration including photosynthetic light independent reactions calvin cycle calvin cycle carbon fixation independent reactions the light independent dark reactions the enzyme rubisco captures from the atmosphere and process that requires the newly formed called the benson releases carbon which are later combined form sucrose and the overall equation for the independent reactions green plants more carbon fixation produces intermediate which then converted the final carbohydrate the carbon skeletons produced photosynthesis are then variously used form other organic such the building material cellulose precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis fuel cellular respiration the latter occurs not only plants but also animals when the energy from plants gets passed through food chain the fixation reduction carbon dioxide process which carbon dioxide combines with carbon ribulose bisphosphate yield two molecules carbon glycerate phosphate also known phosphoglycerate the presence atp and nadph from the dependent reduced glyceraldehyde phosphate this product also referred phosphoglyceraldehyde pgal even triose triose carbon sugar see carbohydrates most out molecules the produced used regenerate rubp the process can continue see calvin benson cycle the out molecules the triose phosphates not recycled often condense form hexose phosphates which ultimately yield sucrose starch and cellulose the sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can used for other metabolic reactions like the production amino acids and lipids carbon concentrating mechanisms land carbon fixation hot and dry plants close their stomata prevent the loss under these will and oxygen produced the light reactions will decrease the not causing increase photorespiration the oxygenase activity ribulose bisphosphate oxygenase and decrease carbon some plants have evolved mechanisms increase the concentration the leaves under these carbon fixation plants chemically fix carbon dioxide the cells the mesophyll adding the carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate reaction catalyzed enzyme called pep carboxylase creating the carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid oxaloacetic acid malate synthesized this process then translocated specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme rubisco and other calvin cycle enzymes are and where released decarboxylation the carbon acids then fixed rubisco activity the carbon sugar phosphoglyceric acids the physical separation rubisco from the generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases fixation thus photosynthetic capacity the plants can produce more sugar than plants conditions high light and many important crop plants are plants including sorghum sugarcane and plants that not use carboxylase carbon fixation are called plants because the primary carboxylation catalyzed produces the carbon sugar phosphoglyceric acids directly the benson over plants use carbon compared that use carbon however the fact that has evolved over plant lineages makes striking example convergent evolution cam photosynthesis xerophytes such cacti and most succulents also use pep carboxylase capture carbon dioxide process called crassulacean acid metabolism contrast metabolism which physically separates the fixation pep from the calvin cam temporally separates these two cam plants have different leaf anatomy from plants and fix the when their stomata are cam plants store the mostly the form malic acid via carboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate which then reduced decarboxylation malate during the day releases inside the thus allowing carbon fixation phosphoglycerate sixteen thousand species plants use water cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes which increase the concentration around rubisco increase the rate carbonic anhydrase located within the carboxysome releases from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions hco before the diffuses out quickly sponged which concentrated within the hco ions are made from outside the cell another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell membrane they cannot cross the membrane they are and within the cytosol they turn back into very slowly without the help carbonic this causes the hco ions accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the pyrenoids algae and hornworts also act concentrate around order and kinetics the overall process photosynthesis takes place four femtosecond picosecond picosecond nanosecond microsecond millisecond millisecond second efficiency photosynthetic efficiency plants usually convert light into chemical energy with photosynthetic efficiency absorbed light that unconverted dissipated primarily with small fraction emitted chlorophyll fluorescence longer wavelengths actual photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency the light being light temperature and proportion carbon dioxide the and can vary from solar panels convert light into electric energy efficiency approximately for produced and above laboratory photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed directly measure the amount light absorbed the nevertheless the light response curves that systems like the allow comparisons photosynthetic efficiency between phenomenon known quantum walk increases the efficiency the energy transport light the photosynthetic cell bacterium there are sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged shaped structure named when photon absorbed converted into quasiparticle referred exciton which jumps from chromophore chromophore towards the reaction center the collection molecules that traps its energy chemical form that makes accessible for the the wave properties enable cover wider area and try out several possible paths allowing instantaneously choose the most efficient where will have the highest probability arriving its destination the minimum possible because takes place temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur quantum walking only possible over very short due obstacles the form destructive interference that will come into these cause the particle lose its wave properties for instant before regains them once again after freed from its locked position through classic hop the distance towards the center therefore covered series conventional hops and quantum evolution plagiomnium affine evolution photosynthesis early photosynthetic such those from green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria are thought have been using various molecules electron donors green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought have used hydrogen and sulfur electron green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids purple nonsulfur bacteria used variety nonspecific organic the use these molecules consistent with the geological evidence that the atmosphere was highly reduced that time citation needed fossils what are thought filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated billion years the main source oxygen the atmosphere oxygenic photosynthesis and its first appearance sometimes referred the oxygen catastrophe geological evidence suggests that oxygenic such that cyanobacteria became important during the paleoproterozoic era around billion years modern photosynthesis plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes oxygenic photosynthesis uses water electron which oxidized molecular oxygen the photosynthetic reaction center symbiosis and the origin chloroplasts several groups animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic these are most common corals sponges and sea anemones presumed that this due the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas these animals compared their few marine mollusks elysia viridis and elysia chlorotica also maintain symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae their diet and then store their this allows the mollusks survive solely photosynthesis for several months some the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred the that the chloroplasts can supplied with proteins that they need even closer form symbiosis may explain the origin chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria including circular chromosome prokaryotic type ribosomes and similar proteins the photosynthetic reaction the endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired endocytosis early eukaryotic cells form the first plant cells therefore chloroplasts may photosynthetic bacteria that adapted life inside plant like mitochondria chloroplasts still possess their own separate from the nuclear dna their plant host cells and the genes this chloroplast dna resemble those cyanobacteria dna chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such photosynthetic reaction the corr hypothesis proposes that this location required for edox cyanobacteria and the evolution photosynthesis the biochemical capacity use water the source for electrons photosynthesis evolved common ancestor extant cyanobacteria the geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early least million years ago and much because the atmosphere contained almost oxygen during the estimated development many scientists believe that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate available evidence from geobiological studies archean sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed but the question when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved still clear paleontological window cyanobacterial evolution opened about revealing diverse biota cyanobacteria remained principal primary producers throughout the proterozoic eon part because the redox structure the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable nitrogen fixation citation needed green algae joined greens major primary producers continental shelves near the end the proterozoic but only with the mesozoic radiations coccolithophorids and diatoms did primary production marine shelf waters take modern cyanobacteria remain critical marine ecosystems primary producers oceanic agents biological nitrogen and modified the plastids marine the oriental hornet vespa orientalis converts sunlight into electric power using pigment called xanthopterin this the first evidence member the animal kingdom engaging discovery although some the steps photosynthesis are still not completely the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the jan van helmont began the research the process the century when carefully measured the mass the soil used plant and the mass the plant after noticing that the soil mass changed very hypothesized that the mass the growing plant must come from the the only substance added the potted his hypothesis was partially accurate much the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide well however this was signaling point the idea that the bulk biomass comes from the inputs not the soil joseph priestley chemist and discovered when isolated volume air under inverted and burned candle the candle would burn out very much before ran out further discovered that mouse could similarly injure air then showed that the air that had been injured the candle and the mouse could restored jan ingenhousz court physician the austrian empress repeated discovered that was the influence sunlight the plant that could cause revive mouse matter jean senebier swiss botanist and demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence soon nicolas odore saussure showed that the increase mass the plant grows could not due only uptake but also the incorporation thus the basic reaction which photosynthesis used produce food such was cornelis van niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria was the first scientist demonstrate that photosynthesis dependent redox reaction which hydrogen reduces carbon robert emerson discovered two light reactions testing plant productivity using different wavelengths with the red the light reactions were when blue and red were the output was much more thus there were two one absorbing the other the former known the latter psi contains only chlorophyll psii contains primarily chlorophyll with most the available chlorophyll among other these include which are the red and blue pigments red and blue algae and fucoxanthol for brown algae and the process most productive when absorption quanta are equal both the psii and assuring that input energy from the antenna complex divided between the psi and psii which turn powers the robert hill thought that complex reactions consisting intermediate cytochrome now another from cytochrome step the generating these are linked which does require energy reduce cytochrome for sufficient further experiments prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis green plants came from were performed hill and showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen the presence unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate ferricyanide benzoquinone after exposure the hill reaction where the electron therefore the electron acceptor reduced and oxygen samuel ruben and martin kamen used radioactive isotopes determine that the oxygen liberated photosynthesis came from the melvin calvin and andrew benson along with james bassham elucidated the path carbon assimilation the photosynthetic carbon reduction the carbon reduction cycle known the calvin cycle which ignores the contribution bassham and many scientists refer the cycle the benson benson and some even call the bassham cycle nobel prize winning scientist rudolph marcus was able discover the function and significance the electron transport otto heinrich warburg and dean burk discovered the quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the activated the louis duysens and jan amesz discovered that chlorophyll will absorb one oxidize cytochrome chlorophyll and other will absorb another but will reduce this same oxidized stating the two light reactions are development the concept charles reid barnes proposed two photosyntax and photosynthesis for the biological process synthesis complex carbon compounds out carbonic the

the factors this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed january leaf there are three main factors affecting photosynthesis and several corollary the three main light irradiance and wavelength carbon dioxide concentration temperature light intensity wavelength and temperature curve the early frederick blackman and gabrielle matthaei investigated the effects light intensity irradiance and temperature the rate carbon constant the rate carbon assimilation varies with initially increasing the irradiance however higher this relationship longer holds and the rate carbon assimilation reaches constant the rate carbon assimilation increases the temperature increased over limited this effect seen only high irradiance low increasing the temperature has little influence the rate carbon these two experiments illustrate several important first from research known photochemical reactions are not affected temperature however these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate carbon there must two sets reactions the full process carbon these the light dependent stage and the light temperature dependent stage second blackman experiments illustrate the concept limiting factors another limiting factor the wavelength cyanobacteria which reside several meters cannot receive the correct wavelengths required cause photoinduced charge separation conventional photosynthetic combat this series proteins with different pigments surround the reaction this unit called phycobilisome carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration carbon dioxide concentrations the rate which sugars are made the light independent reactions increases until limited other rubisco the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide the independent has binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and when the concentration carbon dioxide rubisco will fix carbon dioxide however the carbon dioxide concentration rubisco will bind oxygen instead carbon this called photorespiration uses but does not produce rubisco oxygenase activity disadvantageous plants for several one product oxygenase activity phosphoglycolate carbon instead phosphoglycerate carbon phosphoglycolate cannot metabolized the benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the high oxygenase therefore drains the sugars that are required recycle ribulose bisphosphate and for the continuation the calvin benson cycle phosphoglycolate quickly metabolized glycolate that toxic plant high inhibits salvaging glycolate energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate and only the carbon returned the benson cycle the reactions also produce ammonia which able diffuse out the leading loss the salvaging
