biology	prokaryote navigation search bacterium play media the prokaryotes are group organisms whose cells lack bound nucleus those organisms whose cells have well defined membrane bound nucleus and organelles are called eukaryotes most prokaryotes are unicellular organisms although few such myxobacteria have multicellular stages their life cycles create large colonies like cyanobacteria the word prokaryote comes from the greek pro before and karyon nut kernel prokaryotes not have membrane bound mitochondria any other bound organelles consequently all their intracellular soluble components proteins dna and metabolites are located together the same volume enclosed the cell membrane rather than separate cellular compartments the division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects two distinct levels cellular organization rather than biological classification prokaryotes include two major classification domains the bacteria and the archaea archaea were recognized domain these organisms were originally thought live only inhospitable conditions such extremes temperature and radiation but have since been found all types habitats contents relationship eukaryotes sociality reproduction dna transfer structure morphology prokaryotic cells environment evolution prokaryotes see also references external links relationship eukaryotes the division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes usually considered the most important distinction difference among the distinction that eukaryotic cells have true nucleus containing their dna whereas prokaryotic cells not have one criticism this classification points out that the word prokaryote based what these organisms are not they are not rather than what they are either archaea another difference that ribosomes prokaryotes are smaller than however two organelles found many eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomes similar size and makeup those found this one many pieces evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts are themselves descended from living this theory holds that early eukaryotic cells took primitive prokaryotic cells phagocytosis and adapted themselves incorporate their leading the mitochondria see the genome prokaryote held within dna protein complex the cytosol called the nucleoid which lacks nuclear envelope the complex contains cyclic double stranded molecule stable chromosomal contrast the multiple compact highly organized chromosomes found eukaryotic many important genes prokaryotes are stored separate circular dna structures called plasmids prokaryotes lack mitochondria and chloroplasts instead processes such oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis take place across the prokaryotic cell membrane however prokaryotes possess some internal such prokaryotic cytoskeletons and the bacterial order planctomycetes have membrane around their nucleoid and contain other bound cellular both eukaryotes and prokaryotes contain large rna protein structures called ribosomes which produce protein prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic therefore prokaryotes have larger surface volume ratio giving them higher metabolic rate higher growth and shorter generation time than carl woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the bacteria and archaea originally eubacteria and because the major differences the structure and genetics between the two groups this arrangement eukaryota also called eukarya bacteria and archaea called the three domain system replacing the traditional two empire system sociality while prokaryotes are considered strictly most are capable forming stable aggregate when such communities are encased stabilizing polymer matrix slime they may called biofilms cells biofilms often show distinct patterns gene expression phenotypic time and also with multicellular these changes expression appear often result from cell cell signaling phenomenon known quorum sensing biofilms may highly heterogeneous and structurally complex and may attach solid exist air potentially even liquid bacterial biofilms are often made microcolonies approximately shaped masses bacteria and separated voids through which the medium water may flow relatively the microcolonies may join together above the substratum form continuous closing the network channels separating this structural combined with observations that oxygen limitation ubiquitous challenge for anything growing size beyond the scale least partially eased movement medium throughout the has led some speculate that this may constitute circulatory system and many researchers have started calling prokaryotic communities multicellular for example differential cell collective signaling programmed cell death and some discrete biological dispersal events all seem point this however these colonies are seldom ever founded single founder the way that animals and plants are founded single which presents number theoretical most explanations operation and the evolution multicellularity have focused high relatedness between members group whole copy gene present all members behaviors that promote cooperation between members may permit those members have greater fitness than similar group selfish individuals see inclusive fitness and hamilton rule should these instances prokaryotic sociality prove the rule rather than the would have serious implications for the way view prokaryotes general and the way deal with them bacterial biofilms may times more resistant antibiotics than living unicells and may nearly impossible remove from surfaces once they have colonized other aspects bacterial such bacterial conjugation and mediated present additional challenges researchers and medical professionals seeking treat the associated reproduction bacteria and archaea reproduce through asexual reproduction usually binary fission genetic exchange and recombination still but this form horizontal gene transfer and not replicative simply involving the transference dna between two bacterial conjugation dna transfer dna transfer between prokaryotic cells occurs both bacteria and although has been mainly studied gene transfer occurs three these are bacterial virus bacteriophage mediated transduction plasmid mediated conjugation and natural transformation transduction bacterial genes bacteriophage appears reflect occasional error during intracellular assembly virus rather than adaptation the host the transfer bacterial dna under the control the genes rather than bacterial conjugation the studied coli system controlled plasmid and adaptation for distributing copies plasmid from one bacterial host infrequently during this plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial and subsequently transfer part the host bacterial dna another plasmid mediated transfer host bacterial dna also appears accidental process rather than bacterial adaptation natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer dna from one bacterium another through the intervening unlike transduction and transformation clearly bacterial adaptation for dna because depends numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact perform this complex for bacterium take and recombine donor dna into its own must first enter special physiological state called competence about genes are required bacillus subtilis for the development the length dna transferred during subtilis transformation can much third the whole transformation common mode dna and prokaryotic species are thus far known naturally competent for the development competence nature usually associated with stressful environmental and appears adaptation for promoting repair dna damage recipient among halobacterium volcanii forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear used for transfer dna from one cell another sulfolobus solfataricus transfers dna between cells direct frols found that exposure solfataricus dna damaging agents induces cellular and suggested that cellular aggregation may enhance dna transfer among cells provide increased repair damaged dna via homologous structure recent research indicates that all prokaryotes actually have cytoskeletons albeit more primitive than those besides homologues actin and tubulin mreb and ftsz the helically arranged block the flagellum flagellin one the most significant cytoskeletal proteins provides structural backgrounds chemotaxis the basic cell physiological response least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can seen primitive membranous organelles intracellular are known some groups such vacuoles membrane systems devoted special metabolic photosynthesis chemolithotrophy some species also contain enclosed microcompartments which have distinct physiological roles carboxysomes gas most prokaryotes are between and but they can vary size from thiomargarita namibiensis prokaryotic cell structure flagellum cell membrane cell wall mycoplasma cytoplasm ribosome

environment prokaryotes live nearly all environments some archaea and bacteria thrive harsh such high temperatures thermophiles high salinity halophiles organisms such these are referred extremophiles many archaea grow plankton the symbiotic prokaryotes live the bodies other including evolution prokaryotes the current model the evolution the first living organisms that these were some form which may have evolved out protocells the eukaryotes are thought have evolved later the history however some authors have questioned this arguing that the current set prokaryotic species may have evolved from more complex eukaryotic ancestors through process others have argued that the three domains life arose from set varied cells that formed single gene this controversy was summarized there consensus among biologists concerning the position the eukaryotes the overall scheme cell current opinions the origin and position eukaryotes span broad spectrum including the views that eukaryotes arose first evolution and that prokaryotes descend from that eukaryotes arose contemporaneously with eubacteria and archeabacteria and hence represent primary line descent equal age and rank the that eukaryotes arose through symbiotic event entailing endosymbiotic origin the that eukaryotes arose without and that eukaryotes arose through symbiotic event entailing simultaneous endosymbiotic origin the flagellum and the addition many other which have been reviewed and summarized the oldest known fossilized prokaryotes were laid down approximately billion years only about billion years after the formation the eukaryotes only appear the fossil record and may have formed from endosymbiosis multiple prokaryote the oldest known fossil eukaryotes are about billion years however some genetic evidence suggests eukaryotes appeared early billion years while earth the only place the universe where life known some have suggested that there evidence mars fossil living but this possibility remains the subject considerable debate and prokaryotes have diversified greatly throughout their long the metabolism prokaryotes far more varied than that leading many highly distinct prokaryotic for
