biology	radiobiology navigation search radiobiology also known radiation biology field clinical and basic medical sciences originated from leopold freund demonstration the therapeutic treatment hairy mole using new type electromagnetic radiation called rays which was discovered year previously the german wilhelm ntgen the same pierre and marie curie discovered the radioactive polonium and radium later used treat cancer simplest radiobiology the study the action ionizing radiation living contents health effects exposure pathways external internal history areas interest radiation sources for radiobiology see also references and further reading health effects ionizing radiation generally harmful and potentially lethal living things but can have health benefits radiation therapy for the treatment cancer and thyrotoxicosis its most common impact the induction cancer with latent period years decades after high doses can cause visually dramatic radiation burns and rapid fatality through acute radiation syndrome controlled doses are used for medical imaging and radiotherapy some scientists suspect that low doses may have mild hormetic effect that can improve some effects ionizing radiation human health are stochastic meaning that their probability occurrence increases with while the severity independent radiation induced cancer teratogenesis cognitive decline and heart disease are all examples stochastic other conditions such radiation burns acute radiation syndrome chronic radiation syndrome and radiation induced thyroiditis are deterministic meaning they reliably occur above threshold and their severity increases with deterministic effects are not necessarily more less serious than stochastic either can ultimately lead temporary nuisance other effects include radiation induced lung injury cataracts and quantitative data the effects ionizing radiation human health relatively limited compared other medical conditions because the low number cases and because the stochastic nature some the stochastic effects can only measured through large epidemiological studies where enough data has been collected remove confounding factors such smoking habits and other lifestyle the richest source quality data comes from the study japanese atomic bomb survivors vitro and animal experiments are but radioresistance varies greatly across the consensus the nuclear regulators and governments regarding radiation health effects expressed the international commission radiological protection other important organizations studying the topic include international commission radiation units and measurements united nations scientific committee the effects atomic radiation national council radiation protection and measurements public health england national academy sciences nas through the beir french institut radioprotection nucl aire european committee radiation risk exposure pathways external external exposure exposure which occurs when the radioactive source other radiation outside and remains the organism which examples external exposure person who places sealed radioactive source his pocket space traveller who irradiated cosmic rays person who treated for cancer either teletherapy brachytherapy while brachytherapy the source inside the person still considered external exposure because does not result committed dose nuclear worker whose hands have been dirtied with radioactive assuming that his hands are cleaned before any radioactive material can inhaled skin contamination considered external external exposure relatively easy and the irradiated organism does not become except for case where the radiation intense neutron beam which causes activation internal internal exposure occurs when the radioactive material enters the and the radioactive atoms become incorporated into the this can occur through ingestion below are series examples internal the exposure caused potassium present within normal person the exposure the ingestion soluble radioactive such cows milk person who being treated for cancer means radiopharmaceutical where radioisotope used drug usually liquid review this topic was published because the radioactive material becomes intimately mixed with the affected object often difficult decontaminate the object person case where internal exposure while some very insoluble materials such fission products within uranium dioxide matrix might never able truly become part normal consider such particles the lungs and digestive tract form internal contamination which results internal boron neutron capture therapy involves injecting boron tagged chemical that preferentially binds tumor neutrons from nuclear reactor are shaped neutron moderator the neutron energy spectrum suitable for bnct the tumor selectively bombarded with these the neutrons quickly slow down the body become low energy thermal neutrons these thermal neutrons are captured the injected forming excited which breaks down into lithium and helium alpha particle both these produce closely spaced ionizing this concept described binary system using two separate components for the therapy each component itself relatively harmless the but when combined together for treatment they produce highly cytocidal cytotoxic effect which lethal within limited range micrometers approximately one cell clinical with promising are currently carried out finland and when radioactive compounds enter the human the effects are different from those resulting from exposure external radiation especially the case alpha which normally does not penetrate the the exposure can much more damaging after ingestion the radiation exposure normally expressed committed dose history although radiation was discovered late the dangers radioactivity and radiation were not immediately acute effects radiation were first observed the use rays when wilhelm ntgen intentionally subjected his fingers rays published his observations concerning the burns that though misattributed them free radical produced air other free radicals produced within the body are now understood more his injuries healed the genetic effects including the effects cancer were recognized much hermann joseph muller published research showing genetic and was awarded the nobel prize for his before the biological effects radiation were many physicians and corporations had begun marketing radioactive substances patent medicine and radioactive quackery examples were radium enema treatments and containing waters drunk marie curie spoke out against this sort warning that the effects radiation the human body were not well curie later died aplastic anemia caused radiation eben byers famous american died multiple cancers but not acute radiation after consuming large quantities radium over several his death drew public attention dangers the after number cases bone necrosis and death radium containing medical products had nearly vanished from the the united the experience the called radium girls where thousands dial painters contracted oral cancers but cases acute radiation syndrome popularized the warnings occupational health associated with radiation robley evans developed the first standard for permissible body burden key step the establishment nuclear medicine field with the development nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons the heightened scientific attention was given the study all manner radiation the atomic bombings hiroshima and nagasaki resulted large number incidents radiation allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and red cross hospital terufumi sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome the weeks and months following the hiroshima sasaki and his team were able monitor the effects radiation
