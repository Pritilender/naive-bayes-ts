typically strains that are selectively bred are domesticated and the breeding normally done professional breeder bred animals are known breeds while bred plants are known varieties cultigens cultivars the offspring two purebreed animals but different breeds called crossbreed and crossbred plants are called hybrids there are two approaches types artificial selective first the traditional which the breeder experimenter applies known amount selection single phenotypic examining the chosen trait and choosing breed only those that exhibit higher extreme that the second called controlled natural which essentially natural selection controlled the breeder does not choose which individuals being tested survive she could the traditional there are also selection which third approach and these are conducted order determine the strength natural selection the however this more often observational approach opposed experimental animal breeding techniques such inbreeding linebreeding and outcrossing

history selective breeding both plants and animals has been practiced since early prehistory key species such wheat rice and dogs have been significantly different from their wild ancestors for and maize which required especially large changes from teosinte its wild was selectively bred mesoamerica selective breeding was practiced the romans treatises much years old give advice selecting animals for different and these ancient works cite still older such mago the carthaginian the notion selective breeding was later expressed the persian muslim polymath abu rayhan biruni the noted the idea his book titled india and gave various the agriculturist selects his letting grow much and tearing out the the forester leaves those branches which perceives whilst cuts away all the bees kill those their kind who only but not work their selective breeding was established scientific practice robert bakewell during the british agricultural revolution the arguably his most important breeding program was with using native was able quickly select for yet boned with lustrous the lincoln longwool was improved and turn the lincoln was used develop the subsequent named the new leicester was hornless and had meaty body with straight top these sheep were exported including australia and north america and have contributed numerous modern despite that fact that they fell quickly out favor market preferences meat and textiles bloodlines these original new leicesters survive today the english leicester leicester which primarily kept for wool bakewell was also the first breed cattle used

more farmers followed his farm animals increased dramatically size and the average weight bull sold for slaughter was pounds that weight had more than doubled pounds however after his the dishley longhorn was replaced with horn also bred the improved black cart which later became the shire horse charles darwin coined the term selective was interested the process illustration his proposed wider process natural selection darwin noted that many domesticated animals and plants had special properties that were developed intentional animal and plant breeding from individuals that showed desirable and discouraging the breeding individuals with less desirable darwin used the term artificial twice the first edition his work the origin species chapter natural and chapter difficulties theory slow though the process selection may feeble man can much his powers artificial can see limit the amount the beauty and infinite complexity the adaptations between all organic one with another and with their physical conditions which may effected the long course time power are profoundly ignorant the causes producing slight and unimportant and are immediately made conscious this reflecting the differences the breeds our domesticated animals different more especially the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial animal breeding animal breeding fife animals with homogeneous behavior and other characteristics are known particular and they are bred through culling animals with particular traits and selecting for further breeding those with other purebred animals have recognizable and purebreds with recorded lineage are called pedigreed crossbreeds are mix two whereas mixed breeds are mix several often animal breeding begins with breeding group animals used for the purpose planned when individuals are looking breed they look for certain valuable traits purebred stock for certain may intend use some type crossbreeding produce new type stock with and superior abilities given area for breed typical breeder intends receive meat and young birds for further thus the breeder has study different breeds and types chickens and analyze what can expected from certain set characteristics before she starts breeding therefore when purchasing initial breeding the breeder seeks group birds that will most closely fit the purpose purebred breeding aims establish and maintain stable that animals will pass the next breeding the best the employing certain degree inbreeding considerable and selection for superior qualities one could develop bloodline superior certain respects the original base such animals can recorded with breed registry the organization that maintains pedigrees and stud books however single trait breeding for only one trait over all can one case mentioned animal behaviorist temple grandin roosters bred for fast growth heavy muscles did not know how perform typical rooster courtship which alienated the roosters from hens and led the roosters kill the hens after reproducing with the observable phenomenon hybrid vigor stands contrast the notion breed however the other indiscriminate breeding crossbred hybrid animals may also result degradation studies evolutionary physiology behavioral genetics and other areas organismal biology have also made use deliberate selective though longer generation times and greater difficulty breeding can make such projects challenging plant breeding plant breeding usda plant breeding has been used for thousands and began with the domestication wild plants into uniform and predictable agricultural cultigens high yielding varieties have been particularly important selective plant breeding also used research produce transgenic animals that breed true are homozygous for artificially inserted deleted genes citation needed selective breeding aquaculture selective breeding aquaculture holds high potential for the genetic improvement fish and unlike terrestrial the potential benefits selective breeding aquaculture were not realized until this because high mortality led the selection only few causing inbreeding which then forced the use wild this was evident selective breeding programs for growth which resulted slow growth and high control the reproduction cycle was one the main reasons requisite for selective breeding artificial reproduction was not achieved because the difficulties hatching feeding some farmed species such eel and yellowtail suspected reason associated with the late realisation success selective breeding programs aquaculture was the education the concerned people researchers advisory personnel and fish the education fish biologists paid less attention quantitative genetics and breeding another was the failure documentation the genetic gains successive this turn led failure quantifying economic benefits that successful selective breeding programs documentation the genetic changes was considered important they help fine tuning further selection quality traits aquaculture aquaculture species are reared for particular traits such growth survival meat resistance age sexual fecundity shell traits like shell shell etc growth rate growth rate normally measured either body weight body gjedrem this trait great economic importance for all aquaculture species faster growth rate speeds the turnover production gjedrem improved growth rates show that farmed animals utilize their feed more efficiently through correlated response gjedrem survival rate survival rate may take into account the degrees resistance diseases gjedrem this may also see the stress response fish under stress are highly vulnerable diseases gjedrem the stress fish experience could chemical environmental meat quality the quality fish great economic importance the fish quality usually takes into account meatiness and percentage colour taste shape the ideal oil and content gjedrem age sexual maturation the age maturity aquaculture species another very important attribute for farmers during early maturation the species divert all their energy gonad production affecting growth and meat production and are more susceptible health problems gjerde fecundity the fecundity fish and shellfish usually high not considered major trait for however selective breeding practices may consider the size the egg and correlate with survival and early growth rate gjedrem finfish response selection salmonids gjedrem showed that selection atlantic salmon salmo salar led increase body weight per comparative study the performance select atlantic salmon with wild fish was conducted akvaforsk genetics centre the for which the selection was done included growth feed protein energy and feed conversion selected fish had twice better growth higher feed and increased protein and energy this led overall better fed conversion efficiency compared the wild stock thodeson atlantic salmon have also been selected for resistance bacterial and viral selection was done check resistance infectious pancreatic necrosis virus the results showed mortality for resistant species whereas the resistant species showed mortality compared wild species storset rainbow trout gairdneri was reported show large improvements growth rate after generations selection donaldson and olson kincaid showed that growth gains could achieved selectively breeding rainbow trout for three increase growth was recorded per generation for rainbow trout kause high resistance ipnv rainbow trout has been achieved selectively breeding the resistant strains were found have average mortality whereas mortality was observed highly sensitive strain okamoto coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch increase weight was found more than after four generations selective breeding hershberger neira conducted experiments early spawning dates coho after selectively breeding the fish for four spawning dates were days cyprinids selective breeding programs for the common carp cyprinus carpio include improvement shape and resistance experiments carried out the ussr used crossings broodstocks increase genetic diversity and then selected the species for traits like growth exterior traits and and adaptation environmental conditions like variations kirpichnikov and babouchkine selected carp for fast growth and tolerance the ropsha the results showed improvement cold tolerance but did not provide any data for growth increase growth rate was observed the second generation vietnam tran and nguyen moav and wohlfarth showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared selecting for faster schaperclaus showed resistance the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality compared unselected channel catfish growth was seen increase selectively bred iictalurus punctatus more the overall response channel catfish response selection for improved growth rate was found approximately average per generation dunham shellfish response selection oysters selection for live weight pacific oysters showed improvements ranging from compared the wild stock langdon sydney rock oysters saccostrea commercialis showed increase after one generation and increase after two generations nell chilean oysters ostrea chilensis selected for improvement live weight and shell length showed gain one bonamia ostrea protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses nearly european flat oyster ostrea edulis this protistan parasite endemic three regions selective breeding programs show that edulis susceptibility the infection differs across oyster strains study carried out culloty showed that oysters cork ireland had better resistance compared other irish selective breeding program cork harbour uses broodstock from old survivors and further controlled until viable percentage reaches market size culloty over the years oysters have shown develop lower prevalence ostreae infection and percentage ragone calvo selectively bred the eastern crassostrea virginica for resistance against occurring parasites haplosporidium nelson and perkinsus marinus they achieved dual resistance the disease four generations selective the oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility the the end the artificially selected virginica showed higher survival penaeid shrimps selection for growth penaeid shrimps yielded successful selective breeding program for litopenaeus stylirostris saw increase growth after the fourth generation and growth after the fifth generation goyard marsupenaeus japonicas showed increase growth after the first generation hetzel argue conducted selective breeding program the pacific white litopenaeus vannamei the oceanic waimanalo usa from they reported significant responses selection compared the unselected control after one increase was observed growth and increase survival the taura syndrome virus causes mortalities more oceanos colombia selected the survivors the disease form infected ponds and used them parents for the next they achieved satisfying results two three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak the disease cock the resulting heavy losses caused infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus caused number shrimp farming industries started selectively breed shrimps resistant this successful outcomes led development super selected line stylirostris that resistant ihhnv infection tang tang confirmed this showing mortalities challenged super shrimp post larvae and aquatic species versus terrestrial livestock selective breeding programs for aquatic species provide better outcomes compared terrestrial this higher response selection aquatic farmed species can attributed the high fecundity both sexes fish and shellfish enabling higher selection large phenotypic and genetic variation the selected selective breeding aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits the the primary one being that reduces production costs due faster turnover this because faster growth decreased maintenance increased energy and protein and better feed efficiency gjedrem and baranski applying such genetic improvement program aquaculture species will increase productivity meet the increasing demands growing advantages and disadvantages selective breeding direct way determine specific trait can evolve response generation method breeding not accurate the process also more practical and easier understand than sibling the former tests differences between line while the latter dependent upon variance and covariance essentially selective breeding better for traits such physiology and behavior that are hard measure because requires fewer individuals test than generation however there are disadvantages this because single experiment done selective breeding cannot used assess entire group genetic variances and individual experiments must done for every individual also because the necessity selective breeding experiments require maintaining the organisms tested lab greenhouse impractical use this breeding method many controlled mating instances are difficult carry out this case and this necessary
