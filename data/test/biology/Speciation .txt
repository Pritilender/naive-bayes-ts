seen between different genera fish including variations changes the number size their bony variable jaw and color speciation rate there debate the rate which speciation events occur over geologic while some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant over some palaeontologists such niles eldredge and stephen jay gould have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief view known punctuated equilibrium allopatric allopatric speciation during allopatric from the ancient greek allos other greek patr fatherland speciation population splits into two geographically isolated populations for habitat fragmentation due geographical change such mountain building the isolated populations then undergo genotypic phenotypic divergence they become subjected dissimilar selective pressures they independently undergo genetic drift different mutations arise the two when the populations come back into they have evolved such that they are reproductively isolated and are longer capable exchanging island genetics the tendency isolated genetic pools produce unusual has been observed many including insular dwarfism and the radical changes among certain famous island for example komodo the gal pagos islands are particularly famous for their influence charles darwin during his five weeks there heard that gal pagos tortoises could identified and noticed that finches differed from one island but was only nine months later that reflected that such facts could show that species were when returned his speculation evolution deepened after experts informed him that these were separate not just and famously that other differing pagos birds were all species though the finches were less important for more recent research has shown the birds now known darwin finches classic case adaptive evolutionary peripatric peripatric speciation peripatric subform allopatric new

parapatric parapatric speciation parapatric there only partial separation the zones two diverging populations afforded individuals each species may come contact cross habitats from time but reduced

natural selection rather than the effects isolation habitats produced peripatric and allopatric parapatric speciation may associated with differential dependent selection even there gene flow between two populations strong differential selection may impede assimilation and different species may eventually habitat differences may more important the development reproductive isolation than the isolation caucasian rock lizards darevskia rudis valentini and portschinskii all hybridize with each other their hybrid zone however hybridization stronger between portschinskii and rudis which separated earlier but live similar habitats than between valentini and two other which separated later but live climatically different ecologists refer parapatric and peripatric speciation terms

sympatric speciation refers the formation two more descendant species from single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic often cited examples sympatric speciation are found insects that become dependent different host plants the same however the existence sympatric speciation mechanism speciation still hotly scientists have argued that the evidences sympatric speciation are fact examples heteropatric speciation citation needed the best illustrated example sympatric speciation that the cichlids east africa inhabiting the rift valley lakes particularly lake victoria lake malawi and lake tanganyika there are over described and according there could well over species the all the species have diversified from common ancestral fish oryzias latipes about million years their evolution cited example both natural and sexual selection until when there has been dearth strong evidence that supports this form with general feeling that interbreeding would soon eliminate any genetic differences that might but there has been least one that suggests that sympatric speciation has occurred tennessee cave salamanders sympatric speciation driven ecological factors may also account for the extraordinary diversity crustaceans living the depths lake baikal example spined sticklebacks this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed january three spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus freshwater spined which have been studied dolph were once thought provide intriguing example best explained sympatric schluter and colleagues found two different species spined sticklebacks each five different each lake contained large benthic species with large mouth that feeds large prey the littoral well smaller limnetic species with smaller mouth that feeds the small plankton open dna analysis indicated that each lake was colonized presumably marine after the last ice age also showed that the two species each lake are more closely related each other than they are any the species the other the two species each lake are reproductively neither mates with the however aquarium tests showed that the benthic species from one lake able mate with the benthic species from the other likewise the limnetic species from the different lakes are able mate with each these benthic and limnetic species even display their mating preferences when presented with sticklebacks from japanese canadian benthic prefers japanese benthic over its close limnetic relative from its own the researchers concluded that each lake there had been great competition within single original species for limited this led disruptive selection competition favoring fishes either extreme body size and mouth size over those nearer the well assortative mating each size preferred mates like the result was divergence into two subpopulations exploiting different food different parts the the fact that this pattern speciation occurred the same way three separate occasions suggests strongly that ecological factors sympatric population can cause however the dna evidence cited above from mitochondrial dna which can often move easily between closely related species introgression when they hybridize engage despeciation more recent using genetic markers from the nuclear shows that limnetic forms different lakes are more closely related each other and marine than benthic forms the same the spine stickleback now usually considered example double form allopatric which repeated invasions marine forms have subsequently differentiated into benthic and limnetic the spine stickleback provides example how molecular biogeographic studies that rely solely mtdna can and that consideration the genealogical history alleles from multiple unlinked markers nuclear necessary infer speciation speciation via polyploidization polyploidy mechanism that has caused many rapid speciation events sympatry because offspring for tetraploid diploid matings often result triploid sterile however not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental and gene flow may still occur for example through triploid hybrid diploid matings that produce matings between meiotically unreduced gametes from diploids and gametes from tetraploids see also hybrid speciation has been suggested that many the existing plant and most animal species have undergone event polyploidization their evolutionary reproduction successful polyploid species sometimes parthenogenesis apomixis for unknown reasons many asexual organisms are rare instances polyploid mammals are but most often result prenatal hawthorn fly one example evolution work the case the hawthorn rhagoletis pomonella also known the apple maggot which appears undergoing sympatric speciation different populations hawthorn fly feed different distinct population emerged north america the century some time after apples native were this feeding population normally feeds only apples and not the historically preferred fruit hawthorns the current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed some such the fact that six out thirteen allozyme loci are that hawthorn flies mature later the season and take longer mature than apple and that there little evidence interbreeding researchers have documented hybridization suggests that sympatric speciation the emergence the new hawthorn fly example evolution speciation via hybrid formation hybrid speciation reinforcement reinforcement also called the wallace effect the process which natural selection increases reproductive isolation may occur after two populations the same species are separated and then come back into their reproductive isolation was then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible their reproductive isolation then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids which may may not the hybrids are fertile but less fit than their then there will further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred horses and donkeys the reasoning behind this that the parents the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain the hybrid offspring will bear traits from therefore would not fit either ecological niche well either the low fitness the hybrids would cause selection favor assortative mating which would control this sometimes called the wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist alfred russel wallace who suggested the late century that might important factor the hybrid offspring are more fit than their then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are reinforcement favoring reproductive isolation required for both parapatric and sympatric without the geographic area contact between different forms the same called their hybrid will not develop into boundary between the different hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and hybrid offspring are very common these which are usually created diverged species coming into secondary without the two species would have uncontrollable reinforcement may induced artificial selection experiments described artificial speciation new species have been created domesticated animal husbandry but the initial dates and methods the initiation such species are not for domestic sheep were created and longer produce viable offspring with ovis orientalis one species from which they are domestic cattle the other can considered the same species several varieties wild gaur yak etc they readily produce fertile offspring with the documented creations new species the laboratory were performed the late william rice and salt bred fruit drosophila melanogaster using maze with three different choices habitat such dark and each generation was placed into the and the groups flies that came out two the eight exits were set apart breed with each other their respective after five the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because their strong habitat they mated only within the areas they and did not mate with flies that preferred the other the history such attempts described rice and hostert diane dodd used laboratory experiment show how reproductive isolation can evolve drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after several generations placing them different starch and based dodd experiment has been easy for many others including with other kinds fruit flies and research has shown that this rapid evolution reproductive isolation may fact relic infection wolbachia bacteria genetics few speciation genes have been they usually involve the reinforcement process late stages speciation gene causing reproductive isolation was causes hybrid sterility between related hybrid speciation hybrid speciation hybridization between two different species sometimes leads distinct phenotype this phenotype can also fitter than the parental lineage and such natural selection may then favor these eventually reproductive isolation may lead separate however reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents particularly difficult achieve and thus hybrid speciation considered extremely rare the mariana mallard thought have arisen from hybrid hybridisation important means speciation since polyploidy having more than two copies each tolerated plants more readily than polyploidy important hybrids allows with the two different sets chromosomes each being able pair with identical partner during polyploids also have more genetic which allows them avoid inbreeding depression small hybridization without change chromosome number called homoploid hybrid considered very rare but has been shown heliconius butterflies and sunflowers polyploid speciation which involves changes chromosome more common especially plant gene transposition cause theodosius dobzhansky who studied fruit flies the early days genetic research speculated that parts chromosomes that switch from one location another might cause species split into two different mapped out how might possible for sections chromosomes relocate themselves genome those mobile sections can cause sterility species hybrids which can act speciation his idea was but scientists long debated whether actually happened eventually competing theory involving the gradual accumulation mutations was shown occur nature often that geneticists largely dismissed the moving gene however research shows that jumping gene from one chromosome another can contribute the birth new this validates the reproductive isolation key component human speciation humans have genetic similarities with chimpanzees and bonobos their closest suggesting common the central idea biological evolution that all life earth shares common evolution means that are all distant humans and oak hummingbirds and human beings are all descendants luca the last universal common the luca splits into branches different this split called speciation over large number evolution produces diversity forms life due evolutionary such gene mutations migration

though there are similarities article demonstrates that the human genome mosaic with respect evolutionary the variants shared ancestral species said due multiple genetic darwin dilemma addressing the question what the origin there are two key what are the evolutionary mechanisms and what accounts for the separateness and individuality species the since efforts understand the nature species have primarily focused the first and now widely agreed that the critical concept needed understand the origin new species reproductive next focus the second aspect the origin darwin why species the origin species charles darwin interpreted biological evolution terms natural but was perplexed the clustering organisms into chapter book entitled difficulties the discussing these difficulties noted why species have descended from other species fine not everywhere see innumerable transitional why not all nature instead the species see well this dilemma can referred the absence rarity transitional varieties habitat another related the first the absence rarity transitional varieties darwin pointed out that the theory natural selection innumerable transitional forms must have and wondered why not find them embedded countless numbers the crust the that clearly defined species actually exist nature both space and time implies that some fundamental feature natural selection operates generate and maintain the effect sexual reproduction species formation has been argued that the resolution dilemmas lies the fact that crossing sexual reproduction has intrinsic cost the cost rarity arises from the simple requirement crossing sex that takes two individuals benefit analysis sexual species splitting form more species each with fewer individual organisms was the benefit splitting the finer adaptation the smaller species resulting from the this was found that when cost rarity point diminishing returns reached with increasing when this point sexual species are stable and will not continue split into smaller the analysis also indicated that new more finely adapted species cannot compete with larger even moderately better because the cost the cost rarity not only involves the costs failure find but also indirect costs such the cost communication seeking out partner low population see references for numerous examples rarity brings with other rare unusual feature very seldom most instances will indicative mutation which almost certain therefore behooves sexual creatures avoid mates sporting rare unusual the contrasting case organisms that reproduce there cost consequently there are only benefits fine scale thus asexual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation form often many different that darwin expected evolution making their classification into species more correctly morphospecies very punctuated evolution moderately adapted species that are already established are intrinsically stable because the cost such species can only replaced substantially better adapted potential emerging new that are only marginally better adapted than their established would have high cost rarity when they first thus the few individuals the adapted new species would unable compete unless their new adaptive features could compensate for the high initial cost displacement one species another would have quantum this view species evolution consistent with that eldridge and that evolution characterized long periods stasis punctuated relatively rapid changes species thus the fossil record evolutionary progression typically consists species that
