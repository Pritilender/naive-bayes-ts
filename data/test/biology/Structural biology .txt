biology	structural biology navigation search structural biology branch molecular biology biochemistry and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure biological macromolecules especially proteins and nucleic acids how they acquire the structures they and how alterations their structures affect their this subject great interest biologists because macromolecules carry out most the functions cells and because only coiling into specific dimensional shapes that they are able perform these this the tertiary structure depends complicated way the basic primary structures hemoglobin biomolecules are too small see detail even with the most advanced light microscopes the methods that structural biologists use determine their structures generally involve measurements vast numbers identical molecules the same these methods mass spectrometry macromolecular crystallography proteolysis nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy proteins electron paramagnetic resonance cryo electron microscopy multiangle light scattering small angle scattering ultra fast laser spectroscopy dual polarisation interferometry and circular dichroism most often researchers use them study the native states but variations these methods are also used watch nascent denatured molecules assume reassume their native see protein folding third approach that structural biologists take understanding structure bioinformatics look for patterns among the diverse sequences that give rise particular researchers often can deduce aspects the structure integral membrane proteins based the membrane topology predicted hydrophobicity analysis see protein structure prediction the past few years has become possible for highly accurate physical molecular models complement the silico study biological see also primary structure secondary structure tertiary structure quaternary structure structural domain structural motif protein subunit molecular model cooperativity chaperonin structural genomics stereochemistry resolution electron proteopedia the encyclopedia proteins and other protein structure prediction external links wikiversity structural biology department structural biology structural molecular biology magazine website journal structural biology structural biology the virtual library biochemistry and cell biology structural biology europe biology anatomy astrobiology biochemistry biogeography biohistory biomechanics biophysics bioinformatics biostatistics botany cell biology cellular microbiology chemical biology chronobiology computational biology conservation biology cytogenetics developmental biology ecology embryology epidemiology epigenetics evolutionary biology freshwater biology geobiology genetics genomics histology human biology immunology marine biology mathematical biology microbiology molecular biology mycology neuroscience nutrition origin life paleontology parasitology pathology pharmacology phylogenetics physiology quantum biology sociobiology systematics systems biology taxonomy teratology toxicology virology zoology categories molecular biology protein structure biophysics structural biology
