tissue navigation search tissue ground tissue lung hematoxylin eosin biology tissue cellular organizational level intermediate between cells and complete organism tissue ensemble similar cells from the same origin that together carry out specific organs are then formed the functional grouping together multiple the study tissue known histology connection with histopathology the classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block which tissue embedded and then the histological stain and the optical microscope the last couple developments electron microscopy immunofluorescence and the use frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can observed with these the classical appearances tissues can examined health and enabling considerable refinement clinical diagnosis and prognosis contents animal tissues connective tissue muscle tissue nervous tissue epithelial tissue plant tissues meristematic tissues permanent tissues simple permanent tissues parenchyma collenchyma sclerenchyma epidermis complex permanent tissue xylem phloem see also references external links animal tissues pas diastase histoplasma animal tissues can grouped into four basic connective muscle nervous and epithelial multiple tissue types compose organs and body while all animals can generally considered contain the four tissue the manifestation these tissues can differ depending the type for the origin the cells comprising particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications the epithelium all animals derived from the ectoderm and endoderm with small contribution from the mesoderm forming the endothelium specialized type epithelium that composes the vasculature true epithelial tissue present only single layer cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions create selectively permeable this tissue covers all organismal surfaces that come contact with the external environment such the skin the and the digestive serves functions secretion and and separated from other tissues below basal lamina connective tissue connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous they are made cells separated living which called extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape organs and holds them both blood and bone are examples connective the name these support and bind other unlike epithelial connective tissue typically has cells scattered throughout extracellular muscle tissue muscle tissue muscle cells form the active contractile tissue the body known muscle tissue muscular muscle tissue functions produce force and cause motion either locomotion movement within internal muscle tissue separated into three distinct visceral smooth muscle which found the inner linings organs skeletal muscle which found attached bone providing for gross and cardiac muscle which found the heart allowing contract and pump blood throughout they are the longest group cells the human body nervous tissue nervous tissue cells comprising the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system are classified neural the central nervous neural tissue forms the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system forms the cranial nerves and spinal nerves inclusive the motor neurons epithelial tissue epithelium the epithelial tissues are formed cells that cover the organ surfaces such the surface the skin the airways the reproductive tract and the inner lining the digestive tract the cells comprising epithelial layer are linked via tight junctions hence this tissue provides barrier between the external environment and the organ addition this protective epithelial tissue may also specialized function secretion and absorption epithelial tissue helps protect organisms from injury and fluid functions the cell the body surface form the outer layer inside the epithelial cells forms lining mouth alimentary canal protect these epithelial tissues help absorption water nutrient epithelial tissues help elimination waste the different types epithelial tissues are squamous cuboidal columnar glandular ciliated plant tissues flax pith protoxylem xylem phloem sclerenchyma bast fibre cortex epidermis plant tissues are categorized broadly into three tissue the epidermis the ground tissue and the vascular tissue epidermis cells forming the outer surface the leaves and the young plant vascular tissue the primary components vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem these transport fluid and nutrients ground tissue ground tissue less differentiated than other ground tissue manufactures nutrients photosynthesis and stores reserve plant tissues can also divided differently into two meristematic tissues permanent meristematic tissues meristematic tissue consists actively dividing and leads increase length and thickness the the primary growth plant occurs only specific such the tips stems these regions that meristematic tissue cells these tissues are roughly spherical rectangular and have thin cell new cells produced meristem are initially those meristem but the new cells grow and their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated components the region occurrence meristimatic they are classified apical meristem meristem lateral meristem meristem vascular cambium intercalary meristem meristem the cells meristematic tissues are similar structure and have thin and elastic primary cell wall made cellulose they are compactly arranged without cellular spaces between each cell contains dense cytoplasm and prominent nucleus dense protoplasm meristematic cells contains very few normally the meristematic cells are polygonal rectangular meristemetic tissue cells have large nucleus with small they have inter cellular permanent tissues the meristematic tissues that take specific role lose the ability this process taking permanent size and function called cellular differentiation cells meristematic tissue differentiate form different types permanent there are types permanent simple permanent tissues these tissues are called simple because they are composed similar types cells which have common origin and they are further classified parenchyma collenchyma sclerenchyma epidermis parenchyma parenchyma para chyma loose unpacked the bulk consists relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls that are usually loosely packed that large spaces between cells intercellular are found this this tissue provides support plants and also stores some parenchyma contains chlorophyll and performs which case called aquatic large air cavities are present parenchyma give support them float such parenchyma type called collenchyma collenchyma greek word where collen means gum and enchyma means living tissue primary body like parenchyma cells are walled but possess thickening cellulose and pectin substances the corners where number cells join this tissue gives tensile strength the plant and the cells are compactly arranged and have very little cellular occurs chiefly hypodermis stems and absent monocots and collenchymatous tissue acts supporting tissue stems young provides mechanical elasticity and tensile strength the plant helps manufacturing sugar and storing present the margin leaves and resist tearing effect the sclerenchyma sclerenchyma greek word where sclrenes means hard and enchyma means this tissue consists dead these cells have hard and extremely thick secondary walls due uniform distribution lignin lignin deposition thick that the cell walls become rigid and impermeable sclerenchymatous cells are closely packed without cellular spaces between thus they appear hexagonal net transverse section the cells are cemented with the help lamella the middle lamella wall that lies between adjacent sclerenchymatous cells mainly occur hypodermis pericycle secondary xylem and they also occur endocorp almond and made pectin lignin protein the cells sclerenchymatous cells can classified fibres fibres are elongated sclerenchymatous cells with pointed sclerides sclerenchymatous cells which are short and possess extremely lamellated lignified walls with long singular piths they are called the main function sclerenchymatous tissues give support the epidermis the entire surface the plant consists single layer cells called epidermis surface the entire surface the plant has this outer layer hence also called surface most the epidermal cells are relatively the outer and lateral walls the cell are often thicker than the inner the cells forms continuous sheet without inter cellular protects all parts the complex permanent tissue the complex tissue consists more than one type cells which work together complex tissues help the transportation organic water and mineral and down the that why also known conducting and vascular the common types complex permanent tissue xylem wood phloem xylem and phloem together form vascular xylem xylem consists tracheid vessel members xylem fibers xylem xylem conducting tissue vascular plants responsible for conduction water and mineral xylem very important plant tissue part the think bundles pipes running along the main axis stems and carries water and dissolved substances throughout and consists combination parenchyma fibers vessels tracheids and ray long tubes made individual cells are the while vessel members are open each internally there may bars wall material extending across the open these cells are joined end end form long vessel members and tracheids are dead tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered the they not have end openings such the the tracheids ends overlap with each with pairs pits the pit pairs allow water pass from cell while most conduction the xylem and there some side lateral conduction via rays are horizontal rows living parenchyma cells that arise out the vascular and other woody ray will radiate out from the center stems and roots and section will look like the spokes phloem phloem consists sieve tube sieve cell companion cell phloem fiber phloem phloem equally important plant tissue also part the primarily phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the this conduction system composed tube member and companion that are without secondary the parent cells the vascular cambium produce both xylem and this usually also includes parenchyma and ray sieve tubes are formed from tube members laid end the end unlike vessel members not have the end however are full small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell these porous connections are called sieve spite the fact that their cytoplasm actively involved the conduction food sieve tube members not have nuclei the companion cells that are nestled between tube members that function some manner bringing about the conduction sieve tube members that are alive contain polymer called callose stays solution long the cell contents are under repair insect injures cell and the pressure the callose will however the callose and phloem protein will moved through the nearest sieve plate where they will form this prevents further leakage sieve tube contents and the injury not necessarily fatal overall plant turgor phloem transports food and materials plants upwards and downwards see also underwater diving portal cellular differentiation laser capture microdissection plant stem cell tissue microarray tissue stress
