dissociation constant also known acidity constant acid ionization constant quantitative measure the strength acid the equilibrium constant for chemical reaction known dissociation the context acid base reactions the larger the value the more dissociation the molecules solution and thus the stronger the the equilibrium acid dissociation can written symbolically where generic acid that dissociates splitting into known the conjugate base the and the hydrogen ion proton which the case aqueous exists the hydronium ion other solvated the example shown the represents acetic acid and represents the acetate ion the conjugate the chemical species and are said equilibrium when their concentrations not change with the passing the dissociation constant usually written quotient the equilibrium concentrations denoted and due the many orders magnitude spanned values logarithmic measure the acid dissociation constant more commonly used the logarithmic which equal log sometimes also but referred acid dissociation the larger the value the smaller the extent dissociation any given see henderson hasselbalch equation that the weaker the weak acid has value the approximate range acids with value less than about are said strong acids strong acid almost completely dissociated aqueous the extent that the concentration the undissociated acid becomes values for strong acids however estimated theoretical means extrapolating from measurements aqueous solvents which the dissociation constant such acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide contents theoretical background definitions

factors that affect values thermodynamics experimental determination micro constants applications and significance values for common substances see also references further reading external links theoretical background the acid dissociation constant for acid direct consequence the underlying thermodynamics the dissociation the value directly proportional the standard gibbs energy change for the the value the changes with temperature and can understood qualitatively based principle when the reaction endothermic the decreases with increasing the opposite true for exothermic reactions the value also depends molecular structure many for pauling proposed two one for successive polyprotic acids see polyprotic acids below and one estimate the oxyacids based the number and groups see factors that affect values below other structural factors that influence the magnitude the acid dissociation constant include inductive effects mesomeric effects and hydrogen bonding the quantitative behaviour acids and bases solution can understood only their values are the solution can predicted when the analytical concentration and values all acids and bases are conversely possible calculate the equilibrium concentration the acids and bases solution when the these calculations find application many different areas biology medicine and for many compounds used for medication are weak acids and knowledge the values together with the water octanol partition coefficient can used for estimating the extent which the compound enters the blood acid dissociation constants are also essential aquatic chemistry and chemical oceanography where the acidity water plays fundamental living acid base homeostasis and enzyme kinetics are dependent the values the many acids and bases present the cell and the knowledge values necessary for the preparation buffer solutions and also prerequisite for quantitative understanding the interaction between acids bases and metal ions form complexes experimentally values can determined potentiometric titration but for values less than about more than about spectrophotometric nmr measurements may required due practical difficulties with definitions according arrhenius original acid substance that dissociates aqueous releasing the hydrogen ion the equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction known dissociation constant the liberated proton combines with water molecule give hydronium ion naked protons not exist and arrhenius later proposed that the dissociation should written acid base reaction nsted and lowry generalised this further proton exchange the acid loses leaving conjugate the proton transferred the creating conjugate for aqueous solutions acid the base the conjugate base and the conjugate acid the hydronium the lowry definition applies other such dimethyl sulfoxide the solvent acts accepting proton and forming the conjugate acid solution common use abbreviation for the solvated hydrogen regardless the aqueous solution denotes solvated hydronium ion rather than the designation acid base conjugate depends the the conjugate acid base dissociates according which the reverse the equilibrium the hydroxide ion well known here acting the conjugate base the acid acids and bases are thus regarded simply donors and acceptors protons broader definition acid dissociation includes hydrolysis which protons are produced the splitting water for boric acid produces were proton but has been confirmed raman spectroscopy that this due the hydrolysis similarly metal ion hydrolysis causes ions such behave weak equilibrium constant acid dissociation constant particular example equilibrium constant for the specific equilibrium between monoprotic acid and its conjugate base the thermodynamic equilibrium can defined where the activity the chemical species dimensionless since activity activities the products dissociation are placed the activities the reactants are placed the see activity coefficient for derivation this since activity the product concentration and activity coefficient the definition could also written where represents the concentration and quotient activity avoid the complications involved using dissociation constants are determined where medium high ionic strength that under conditions which can assumed always for the medium might solution sodium nitrate potassium perchlorate unit molar concentration furthermore all but the most concentrated solutions can assumed that the concentration approximately dividing the constant terms and writing for the concentration the hydronium ion the expression this the definition common defined log note however that all published dissociation constant values refer the specific ionic medium used their determination and that different values are obtained with different shown for acetic acid the illustration when published constants refer ionic strength other than the one required for particular they may adjusted means specific ion theory and other although appears have the dimension concentration must fact dimensionless would not possible take its logarithm the illusion the result omitting the constant term from the defining nevertheless not particularly texts relating biochemical see value quoted with dimension for monoprotic acids acid monoprotic acids after rearranging the expression defining and putting log one obtains this form the henderson hasselbalch equation from which the following conclusions can neutralization since the neutralization numerically equal conversely when the concentration equal the concentration the buffer region extends over the approximate range though buffering weak outside the range the the ratio may this ratio independent the analytical concentration the measurable values range from about for strong acid about for very weak acid strong all acids with value less than are more than dissociated this known solvent leveling since all such acids are brought the same level being strong acids regardless their values likewise all bases with value larger than the upper limit are more than protonated all attainable values and are classified strong bases example strong acid hydrochloric acid hcl which has value estimated from thermodynamic the concentration undissociated acid solution will less than the concentrations the products hydrochloric acid said fully aqueous solution because the amount undissociated acid when the and analytical concentration the acid are the extent dissociation and solution monoprotic acid can easily calculated using ice table buffer solution desired can prepared mixture weak acid and its conjugate practice the mixture can created dissolving the acid and adding the requisite amount strong acid the the acid must less than two units different from the target polyprotic acids polyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one the constant for dissociation the first proton may denoted and the constants for dissociation successive protons etc phosphoric acid example polyprotic acid can lose three when the difference between successive values about four this each species may considered acid its own fact salts may crystallised from solution adjustment about and salts hpo may crystallised from solution adjustment about the species distribution diagram shows that the concentrations the two ions are maximum and when the difference between successive values less than about four there overlap between the range existence the species the smaller the the more the the case citric acid shown the solutions citric acid are buffered over the whole range according first successive values given acid increase for oxyacids with more than one ionizable hydrogen the same the values often increase about units for each proton the example phosphoric acid the case diprotic the two equilibria are can seen that the second proton removed from negatively charged since the proton carries positive charge extra work needed remove that the cause the trend noted phosphoric acid values illustrate this the values for vanadic acid when exception the rule found indicates that major change structure the case the vanadium octahedral whereas vanadic acid tetrahedral this the basis for explanation why for oxoacids isoelectric point isoelectric point for substances solution the isoelectric point defined the which the weighted charge concentrations positively charged species equal the weighted sum concentrations negatively charged the case that there one species each the isoelectric point can obtained directly from the take the example glycine defined there are two dissociation equilibria substitute the expression for into the first equation the isoelectric point the concentration the positively charged equal the concentration the negatively charged taking cologarithms the given values for amino acids are listed proteinogenic amino chemical properties when more than two charged species are equilibrium with each other full speciation calculation may water ionization self ionization water water possesses both acidic and basic amphoteric the equilibrium constant for the equilibrium given usually the the concentration water can assumed this expression may replaced the self ionization constant thus just special case acid dissociation from these data can deduced that that temperature both hydrogen and hydroxide ions have concentration mol amphoteric substances amphoteric substance one that can act acid depending water another example amphoteric molecule the bicarbonate ion hco that the conjugate base the carbonic acid molecule the equilibrium but also the conjugate acid the carbonate ion the reverse the equilibrium carbonic acid equilibria are important for acid base homeostasis the human amino acid also amphoteric with the added complication that the neutral molecule subject internal base equilibrium which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl forming zwitterion less than about both the carboxylate group and the amino group are increases the acid dissociates according high second dissociation may take thus the zwitter chrco amphoteric because may either protonated bases and basicity historically the equilibrium constant for base has been defined the association constant for protonation the form the conjugate using similar reasoning that used before related for the conjugate the concentration the hydroxide ion related the concentration the hydrogen ion therefore substitution the expression for into the expression for gives when and are determined under the same conditions temperature and ionic taking cologarithms that basicity aqueous solutions with sufficient accuracy for most practical effect there need define separately from but done here often only values can found the older temperature dependence all equilibrium constants vary with temperature according the van hoff equation the gas constant and the absolute temperature thus for exothermic reactions the standard enthalpy change decreases with but for endothermic reactions increases with acidity nonaqueous solutions solvent will more likely promote ionization dissolved acidic molecule the following protic solvent capable forming hydrogen has high donor number making strong lewis base has high dielectric constant relative making good solvent for ionic values organic compounds are often obtained using the aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide and acetonitrile dmso widely used alternative water because has lower dielectric constant than and less polar and dissolves hydrophobic substances more has measurable range about acetonitrile less basic than and acids are weaker and bases are stronger this some values for acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide are shown the following values for water are included for toluenesulfonic acid dinitrophenol benzoic acid acetic acid phenol pyrrolidine triethylamine proton sponge pyridine aniline ionization acids less acidic solvent than for hydrogen chloride weak acid when dissolved acetic acid this because acetic acid much weaker base than compare this reaction with what happens when acetic acid dissolved the more acidic solvent pure sulfuric acid the unlikely geminal diol species stable these for aqueous solutions the scale the most convenient acidity function other acidity functions have been proposed for aqueous the most notable being the hammett acidity function for superacid media and its modified version for superbasic media aprotic oligomers such the known acetic acid dimer may formed hydrogen acid may also form hydrogen bonds its conjugate this known homoconjugation has the effect enhancing the acidity lowering their effective values stabilizing the conjugate homoconjugation enhances the donating power toluenesulfonic acid acetonitrile solution factor nearly aqueous homoconjugation does not because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds the conjugate base than does the mixed solvents when compound has limited solubility water common practice the pharmaceutical for determine values solvent mixture such dioxane methanol which the compound more the example shown the the value rises steeply with increasing percentage dioxane the dielectric constant the mixture value obtained mixed solvent cannot used directly for aqueous the reason for this that when the solvent its standard state its activity defined for the standard state dioxane precisely that solvent with added obtain the value for use with aqueous solutions has extrapolated zero solvent concentration from values obtained from various solvent these facts are obscured the omission the solvent from the expression that normally used define but values obtained given mixed solvent can compared each giving relative acid the same true values obtained particular aqueous solvent such solvent scale for acid dissociation constants has not been since there known way compare the standard states two different factors that affect values pauling second rule that the value the first for acids the formula depends primarily the number oxo groups and approximately independent the number hydroxy groups and also the central atom approximate values are for for for and for alternatively various numerical formulas have been proposed including the dependence correlates with the oxidation state the central the higher the oxidation state the stronger the for for hclo for hclo for hclo and hclo strong acid this rule can help assign molecular for example phosphorous acid has near suggested that the structure later confirmed nmr spectroscopy and not which would expected have near with organic acids inductive effects and mesomeric effects affect the values simple example provided the effect replacing the hydrogen atoms acetic acid the more electronegative chlorine the withdrawing effect the substituent makes ionisation successive values decrease the series and when chlorine atoms are the hammett equation provides general expression for the effect the dissociation constant substituted the dissociation constant when the substituent property the unsubstituted compound and has particular value for each plot log against straight line with intercept log and slope this example linear free energy relationship log proportional the standard fee energy hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents the ortho and para positions some numerical values are hammett equation this and other studies allowed substituents ordered according their electron withdrawing electron releasing power and distinguish between inductive and mesomeric alcohols not normally behave acids but the presence double bond adjacent the group can substantially decrease the the mechanism keto enol tautomerism ascorbic acid example this the diketone pentanedione acetylacetone also weak acid because the enol aromatic such phenol which have conjugation with the aromatic ring whole greatly increases the stability the deprotonated structural effects can also the difference between fumaric acid and maleic acid classic fumaric acid enedioic trans isomer whereas maleic acid the corresponding cis isomer enedioic acid see cis trans isomerism fumaric acid has values approximately and maleic acid has values approximately and the reason for this large difference that when one proton removed from the isomer maleic strong intramolecular hydrogen bond formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl this favors the formation the maleate and opposes the removal the second proton from that the trans isomer the two carboxyl groups are always far hydrogen bonding not proton sponge has value one the strongest amine bases the high basicity attributed the relief strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen effects the solvent and solvation should mentioned also this turns these influences are more subtle than that dielectric medium mentioned for the expected electronic effects methyl and observed gas phase order basicity menh changed water menh neutral methylamine molecules are bonded water molecules mailnly through one interaction and only occasionally just one more donor hence methylamines are stabilized about the same extent regardless the number methyl stark corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor bonding relative stabilization methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number methyl groups explaining the order water basicity thermodynamics equilibrium constant related the standard gibbs energy change for the for acid dissociation constant the gas constant and the absolute temperature note that log and mol mol joules per mole free energy made enthalpy term and entropy term the standard enthalpy change can determined calorimetry using the van hoff equation though the calorimetric method when both the standard enthalpy change and acid dissociation constant have been the standard entropy change easily calculated from the equation the following the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values and the data were critically selected and refer and zero ionic acetic acid glycineh maleic acid citric acid boric acid phosphoric acid hydrogen sulfate oxalic acid ammonia methylamine triethylamine the first point note when the standard free energy change for the dissociation reaction also second some reactions are exothermic and some are endothermic but when negative the dominant which determines that last the entropy contribution always unfavourable these ions aqueous solution tend orient the surrounding water which orders the solution and decreases the the contribution ion the entropy the partial molar entropy which often especially for small highly charged the ionization neutral acid involves formation two ions that the entropy decreases the second ionization the same there are now three ions and the anion has the entropy again note that the standard free energy change for the reaction for the changes from the reactants their standard states the products their standard the free energy change equilibrium zero since the chemical potentials reactants and products are equal experimental determination titration curve oxalic acid sodium hydroxide determination equilibrium constants the experimental determination values commonly performed means titrations medium high ionic strength and constant typical procedure would solution the compound the medium acidified with strong acid the point where the compound fully the solution then titrated with strong base until all the protons have been each point the titration measured using glass electrode and meter the equilibrium constants are found fitting calculated values the observed using the method least squares the total volume added strong base should small compared the initial volume titrand solution order keep the ionic strength nearly this will ensure that remains invariant during the calculated titration curve for oxalic acid shown the oxalic acid has values and therefore the buffer regions will centered about and the buffer regions carry the information necessary get the values the concentrations acid and conjugate base change along buffer between the two buffer regions there equivalence point where the rises about two this point not sharp and typical diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap small about three this the difference values were about two the point would not the second point begins about and this indicates that all the protons have been when this the solution not buffered and the rises steeply addition small amount strong however the does not continue rise new buffer region begins about which where self ionization water becomes very difficult measure values less than two aqueous solution with glass electrode because the nernst equation breaks down such low determine values less than about more than about spectrophotometric nmr measurements may used instead combined when the glass electrode cannot with aqueous spectrophotometric methods are frequently these may involve absorbance fluorescence measurements both cases the measured quantity assumed proportional the sum contributions from each active with absorbance measurements the beer lambert law assumed aqueous solutions with normal water cannot used for nmr measurements but heavy water must used nmr however can used with normal water and nmr spectra can used with aqueous the quantities measured with nmr are averaged chemical shifts proton exchange fast the nmr other chemical such those can micro constants base such spermine has few different sites where protonation can this example the first proton can the terminal group either the internal groups the values for dissociation spermine protonated one other the sites are examples micro constants they cannot determined
