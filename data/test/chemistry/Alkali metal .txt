chemistry has been observed only for the first five members the the chemistry francium not well established due its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation its properties here play media all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found elemental forms because they are usually stored mineral oil kerosene paraffin they react aggressively with the halogens form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble water except lithium fluoride the alkali metals also react with water form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should handled with great the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter for when dropped into caesium produces larger explosion than the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies their respective periods the periodic table because their low effective nuclear charge and the ability attain noble gas configuration losing just one electron the second ionisation energy all the alkali metals very high full shell that also closer the thus they almost always lose single forming the alkalides are they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals oxidation which very unusual before the discovery the the alkali metals were not expected able form anions and were thought able appear salts only the alkalide anions have filled subshells which gives them more stability and allows them all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known able form and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials alkalides are chemically similar the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting particularly striking example alkalide inverse sodium hydride opposed the usual sodium unstable due its high energy resulting from the displacement two electrons from hydrogen although several derivatives are predicted metastable the chemistry lithium shows several differences from that the rest the group the small cation polarises anions and gives its compounds more covalent character lithium and magnesium have diagonal relationship because lithium has some similarities for lithium forms stable nitride property common among all the alkaline earth metals but unique among the alkali among their respective only lithium and magnesium form covalent organometallic compounds and mgme lithium fluoride the only alkali metal halide that not soluble and lithium hydroxide the only alkali metal hydroxide that not deliquescent francium also predicted show some differences due its high atomic weight causing its electrons travel considerable fractions the speed light and thus making relativistic effects more contrast the trend decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies the alkali francium electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted higher than due the relativistic stabilisation the also its atomic radius expected abnormally nuclear properties stable decays italics lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium primordial isotopes trace radioisotope all the alkali metals have odd atomic hence their isotopes must either odd odd both proton and neutron number are odd even proton number but neutron number odd odd nuclei have even mass numbers while even nuclei have odd mass odd odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect beta decay because the decay products are and are therefore more strongly due nuclear pairing effects due the great rarity odd almost all the primordial isotopes the alkali metals are even the exceptions being the light stable isotope and the lived radioisotope potassium for given odd mass there can only single beta stable nuclide since there not difference binding energy between odd and even comparable that between even and leaving other nuclides the same mass number isobars free beta decay toward the mass effect the instability odd number either type nucleons that numbered such the alkali tend have fewer stable isotopes than numbered the monoisotopic elements that have only single stable all but one have odd atomic number and all but one also have even number beryllium the single exception both due its low atomic all the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium and sodium are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically potassium and rubidium have very long half lives and thus occur and all isotopes francium are radioactive caesium was also thought radioactive the early although has naturally occurring francium had not been discovered yet that the natural radioisotope potassium makes about natural and thus natural potassium weakly this natural radioactivity became basis for mistaken claim the discovery for element the next alkali metal after caesium with life one the two principal medium lived fission products along with strontium which are responsible for most the radioactivity spent nuclear fuel after several years several hundred years after constitutes most the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident undergoes energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium strong emitter gamma has very low rate neutron capture and cannot feasibly disposed this but must allowed has been used tracer hydrologic analogous the use tritium small amounts caesium and were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the goi nia accident and the chernobyl disaster caesium the principal source radiation the zone alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant periodic trends periodic trends the alkali metals are more similar each other than the elements any other group are each for when moving down the all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points well heats fusion and their densities increase when moving down the with the exception that potassium less dense than one the very few properties the alkali metals that does not display very smooth trend their reduction potentials lithium value being more negative than the this because the ion has very high hydration energy the gas though the lithium ion disrupts the structure water causing higher change this high hydration energy enough make the reduction potentials indicate being the most electropositive alkali despite the difficulty ionizing the gas atomic and ionic radii atomic radius effective nuclear charge atomic ionic radii note lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium the atomic radii the alkali metals increase going down the because the shielding effect when atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons well electric attraction from the the alkali the outermost electron only feels net charge some the nuclear charge which equal the atomic number cancelled the inner the number inner electrons alkali metal always one less than the nuclear therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius the alkali metals the number electron since this number increases down the the atomic radius must also increase down the the ionic radii the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic this because the outermost electron the alkali metals different electron shell than the inner and thus when removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and additionally the effective nuclear charge has and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius first ionisation energy ionisation energy noble gases note mol lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium note the first ionisation energy element molecule the energy required move the most loosely held electron from one mole gaseous atoms the element molecules form one mole gaseous ions with electric charge the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount shielding the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the which always outer electron main group elements the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron since the outermost electron alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy the distance from the outermost electron the since this distance increases down the the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy this trend broken francium due the relativistic stabilization and contraction the bringing valence electron closer the nucleus than would expected from relativistic this makes outermost electron feel more attraction from the increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that the second ionisation energy the alkali metals much higher than the first the most loosely held electron part fully filled electron shell and thus difficult reactivity reactivity the reactivities the alkali metals increase going down the this the result combination two the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies the alkali because the first ionisation energy the alkali metals decreases down the easier for the outermost electron removed from the atom and participate chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity down the the atomisation energy measures the strength the metallic bond which falls down the group the atoms increase radius and thus the metallic bond must increase making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction the nuclei the heavier alkali adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives quantity closely related but not equal the activation energy the reaction alkali metal with another this quantity decreases going down the and does the activation thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the electronegativity electronegativity main groups second sixth period electronegativities note lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium note electronegativity chemical property that describes the tendency atom functional group attract electrons electron density towards the bond between sodium and chlorine sodium chloride were covalent the pair shared electrons would attracted the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge the outer electrons chlorine but only the electron pair attracted close the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred the chlorine atom ionic bond however the sodium atom was replaced lithium the electrons will not attracted close the chlorine atom before because the lithium atom making the electron pair more strongly attracted the closer effective nuclear charge from hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the will less electronegative the bonding pair less strongly attracted towards because the higher electronegativity some its compounds have more covalent for lithium iodide will dissolve organic solvents property most covalent lithium fluoride the only alkali halide that not soluble and lithium hydroxide the only alkali metal hydroxide that not deliquescent melting and boiling points melting point boiling point note lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium note note the melting point substance the point where changes state from solid liquid while the boiling point substance liquid the point where the vapor pressure the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state gas metal heated its melting the metallic bonds keeping the atoms place weaken that the atoms can move and the metallic bonds eventually break completely the boiling therefore the falling melting and boiling points the alkali metals indicate that the strength the metallic bonds the alkali metals decreases down the this because metal atoms are held together the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions the delocalised the atoms increase size going down the group because their atomic radius the nuclei the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker that the metal can more easily melt and thus lowering the melting and boiling the increased nuclear charge not relevant factor due the shielding density density densities note lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium francium the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure body centred cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number atoms that can fit into certain volume and the mass one the since density defined mass per unit the first factor depends the volume the atom and thus the atomic which increases going down the thus the volume alkali metal atom increases going down the the mass alkali metal atom also increases going down the thus the trend for the densities the alkali metals depends their atomic weights and atomic figures for these two factors are the ratios between the densities the alkali metals can then the resultant trend that the densities the alkali metals increase down the with exception due having the lowest atomic weight all the elements their period and having the largest atomic radius for their the alkali metals are the least dense metals the periodic lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals the periodic table that are less dense than compounds hydroxides reactions the alkali metals with water open university pounds all the alkali metals react vigorously explosively with cold producing aqueous solution the strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink water and generate hydrogen gas rapidly that shock waves form the water that may shatter glass when alkali metal dropped into produces which there are two separate the metal reacts with the water breaking the hydrogen bonds the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali second the heat generated the first part the reaction often ignites the hydrogen causing burn explosively into the surrounding this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl lake other body not the initial reaction the metal with water which tends happen mostly under the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known compounds with the group elements graphite intercalation compound lithium and sodium react with carbon form acetylides and which can also obtained reaction the metal with acetylene potassium rubidium and caesium react with graphite their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite forming graphite intercalation compounds formulae dark almost dark almost steel and these compounds are over times more electrically conductive than pure suggesting that the valence electron the alkali metal transferred the graphite layers upon heating the elimination potassium atoms results the conversion sequence and finally very strong reducing agent and pyrophoric and explodes contact with while the large alkali metals and initially form the smaller ones initially form when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements the carbon group ionic substances with like structures are such the silicide which contains and tetrahedral ions the chemistry alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion and other cluster zintl ions such and largely analogous that the corresponding alkali metal stannides are mostly sometimes with the stannide ion and sometimes with more complex zintl ions such which appears tetrapotassium nonastannide the monatomic plumbide ion and indeed its formation predicted energetically alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl such pnictides unit cell stick model lithium nitride tetrahedral lithium the lightest the alkali the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen standard conditions and its nitride the only stable alkali metal nitrogen unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond the dinitrogen molecule requires lot the formation alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy the alkali metal forming ions the energy required break the triple bond and the formation ions and all the energy released from the formation alkali metal nitride from the lattice energy the alkali metal the lattice energy maximised with highly charged the alkali metals not form highly charged only forming ions with charge only the smallest alkali can release enough lattice energy make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride the reactions the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus endothermic they not form nitrides standard sodium nitride and potassium nitride while are extremely being prone decomposing back into their constituent and cannot produced reacting the elements with each other standard all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic form phosphides and arsenides with the formula where represents alkali metal and represents pnictogen this due the greater size the and ions that less lattice energy needs released for the salts these are not the only phosphides and arsenides the alkali for potassium has nine different known with formulae and while most metals form only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic the structure complex with unusually short distances which are shorter than sodium and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot straightforwardly other alkali metal arsenides not conforming the formula are such which has metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence some metallic bonding the antimonides are unstable and reactive the ion strong reducing reaction them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine sbh bismuthides are not even wholly they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic chalcogenides alkali metal oxide octahedra all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen standard they form various types such simple oxides containing the ion peroxides containing the ion where there single bond between the two oxygen superoxides containing the ion and many lithium burns air form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen form mixture sodium oxide and sodium peroxide potassium forms mixture potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide their reactivity increases going down the while sodium and potassium merely burn rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire the smaller alkali metals tend polarise the more complex anions the peroxide and due their small this attracts the electrons the more complex anions towards one its constituent oxygen forming oxide ion and oxygen this causes lithium form the oxide exclusively reaction with oxygen room this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and allowing them form the less stable rubidium and the bottom the are large that even the least stable superoxides can because the superoxide releases the most energy when the superoxide preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals but not form upon direct reaction the metal with oxygen standard the small size the and ions contributes their forming stable ionic lattice under controlled however all the alkali with the exception are known form their peroxides and the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidizing agents sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen which allows them used submarine air the presence water vapour naturally present makes the removal carbon dioxide potassium superoxide even more all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides through temperature reaction the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may then extracted using liquid ammonia rubidium and caesium can form even more complicated oxides than the rubidium can form and upon oxidation while caesium forms immense variety such the ozonide cso and several brightly coloured suboxides such green cso well the latter may heated under vacuum generate the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception reaction with excess the chalcogen can similarly result lower with chalcogen ions containing chains the chalcogen atoms for sodium can react with sulfur form the sulfide and various polysulfides with the formula from containing the ions due the basicity the and ions the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline when reacted directly with selenium and alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions the alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the ion they are very chemically stable and can produced direct reaction the elements around hydrides and halides alkali metal halide the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements the periodic table and thus tend bond ionically the most electronegative elements the periodic the halogens forming salts known the alkali metal the reaction very vigorous and can sometimes result this includes sodium chloride otherwise known common the reactivity becomes higher from lithium caesium and drops from fluorine iodine all the alkali metal halides have the formula where alkali metal and they are all white ionic crystalline all the alkali metal halides are soluble water except for lithium fluoride which insoluble water due its very high lattice enthalpy the high lattice enthalpy lithium fluoride due the small sizes the and ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride which lithium has diagonal relationship the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen form ionic alkali metal coordination complexes cryptand alkali metal cations not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due their low charge just and their relatively large thus the ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist octahedral hexahydrate complexes with the exception the lithium which due its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted electrostatic forces attraction the polar water because anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used desiccants alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers for for and for and cryptands due electrostatic ammonia solutions unlike most the alkali metals dissolve slowly liquid ammonia forming hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide mnh where represents alkali the process may speeded catalyst the amide salt quite insoluble and readily precipitates out leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions the alkali the colour due the presence solvated electrons which contribute the high electrical conductivity these low concentrations below the solution dark blue and has ten times the conductivity aqueous sodium chloride higher concentrations above the solution coloured and has approximately the conductivity liquid metals like mercury addition the alkali metal amide salt and solvated such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation the neutral alkali metal atom diatomic alkali metal molecules and alkali metal anions these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used chemical organometallic being the smallest alkali lithium forms the widest variety and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded organolithium compounds are electrically conducting volatile solids liquids that melt low and tend form oligomers with the structure where the organic the electropositive nature lithium puts most the charge density the bond the carbon effectively creating carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles for use butyllithiums are often used and are commercially example organolithium compound methyllithium which exists tetrameric and hexameric forms the application organosodium compounds chemistry limited part due competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient the principal organosodium compound commercial importance sodium cyclopentadienide sodium tetraphenylborate can also classified organosodium compound since the solid state sodium bound the aryl organometallic compounds the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and limited notable reagent schlosser base mixture butyllithium and potassium tert butoxide this reagent reacts with propene form the compound allylpotassium kch chch cis butene and trans butene equilibrate when contact with alkali whereas isomerization fast with lithium and slow with the higher alkali the higher alkali metals also favor the sterically congested several crystal structures organopotassium compounds have been establishing that like the sodium are organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble nearly nonpolar extensions ununennium empirical third ninth period angstroms although francium the heaviest alkali metal that has been there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics the hypothetical heavier alkali being the first period element the undiscovered element ununennium element predicted the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners however also predicted differ from the lighter alkali metals some its chemistry predicted closer that potassium rubidium instead caesium this unusual periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium even more reactive than caesium and this lowered reactivity due the relativistic stabilisation valence increasing first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect already seen for this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically alkali which although may not true due relativistic the relativistic stabilisation the orbital also increases electron affinity far beyond that caesium and indeed ununennium expected have electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than relativistic effects also cause very large drop the polarisability the other ununennium predicted continue the trend melting points decreasing going down the being expected have melting point between and eighth period electron volts the stabilisation valence electron and thus the contraction the orbital cause its atomic radius lowered very close that rubidium that the chemistry ununennium the oxidation state should more similar the chemistry rubidium than that the other the ionic radius the uue ion predicted larger than that because the orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the orbitals the lower ununennium may also show the oxidation state which not seen any other alkali addition the oxidation state that characteristic the other alkali metals and also the main oxidation state all the known alkali this because the destabilisation and expansion the spinor causing its outermost electrons have lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise indeed many ununennium compounds are expected have large covalent character due the involvement the electrons the not much work has been done predicting the properties the alkali metals beyond although simple extrapolation the periodic table would put element unhexennium under dirac fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually element unhexpentium which predicted have the electron configuration further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend increasing ionisation energy beyond having ionisation energy comparable that and that should also continue the trend decreasing atomic radii beyond having atomic radius comparable that however the electrons unhexpentium may also able participate chemical reactions along with the possibly allowing oxidation states beyond and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like boron group element than alkali the probable properties the alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet periods and above the periodic relativistic and structure effects become strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely the relativistic and structure effects which stabilise the orbitals and destabilise and expand the and orbitals higher have opposite causing even larger difference between relativistic and relativistic calculations the properties elements with such high atomic due the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being block elements these predictions for the trends and properties ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium and unhexhexium other similar substances hydrogen hydrogen discharge tube the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral usually placed the top group the periodic table for but hydrogen not normally considered alkali when considered alkali because its atomic properties and not its chemical under typical pure hydrogen exists diatomic gas consisting two atoms per molecule however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such dilithium high when they are the gaseous state hydrogen like the alkali has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities end its placement above lithium primarily due its electron configuration and not its chemical sometimes placed above carbon due their similar electronegativities fluorine due their similar chemical the first ionisation energy hydrogen mol much higher than that the alkali only one additional electron required fill the outermost shell the hydrogen hydrogen often behaves like forming the negative hydride ion and sometimes considered the alkali metals can also form negative known alkalides but these are little more than laboratory being under extremely high pressures such those found the cores jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like alkali this known metallic hydrogen ammonium ammonium the ammonium ion has very similar properties the heavier alkali acting alkali metal intermediate between potassium and and often considered close for most alkali metal salts are soluble property which ammonium salts ammonium expected behave stably metal ions sea very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating metallic behaviour occur gpa and could possibly occur inside the ice giants uranus and neptune which may have significant impacts their interior magnetic has been estimated that the transition from mixture ammonia and dihydrogen molecules metallic ammonium may occur pressures just below thallium thallium ampoule argon thallium displays the oxidation state that all the known alkali metals and thallium compounds with thallium its oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium silver compounds due the similar ionic radii the and ions was sometimes considered alkali metal continental europe but not the years immediately following its and was placed just after caesium the sixth alkali metal dmitri mendeleev periodic table and julius lothar meyer periodic periodic table and periodic table put thallium its current position the boron group and leave the space below caesium however thallium also displays the oxidation state which known alkali metal displays although the undiscovered seventh alkali predicted possibly display the oxidation the sixth alkali metal now considered copper silver and gold the group metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete physically they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post transition metals the filled subshell and free electron and contribute their high electrical and thermal transition metals the left group experience interactions between electrons and the partially filled subshell that lower electron chemically the group metals behave like group metals their valence and are hence somewhat related the alkali they are occasionally classified transition their spectra are however analogous those the alkali periodic copper silver and gold are listed once under group viii with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group group was nonetheless parenthesized note that was mendeleev main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state that the group elements could not classified group due the existence and compounds being known that however eliminating group would make group the only main group group viii was labelled transition lack soon majority chemists chose classify these elements group and remove them from group viii for the resulting this was the predominant classification until the rise the modern long column periodic which separated the alkali metals and group metals history three the alkali metals sodium and were part the discovery periodicity they are among series triads elements the same group that were noted johann wolfgang bereiner having similar around john newlands produced series papers where listed the elements order increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred intervals likened such periodicity the octaves his version put all the alkali metals then known lithium well silver and thallium which show the oxidation state characteristic the alkali together into his table placed hydrogen with the after dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing hydrogen the top group above sodium potassium rubidium caesium and copper silver and gold were placed once part group and once part group encompassing groups after the introduction the column the group elements were moved their current position the block while alkali metals were left group later the name was changed group the trivial name alkali comes from the fact that the hydroxides the group elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved discovery sodium compounds have been known since ancient salt sodium chloride has been important commodity human testified the english word salary referring salarium the wafers salt sometimes given roman soldiers along with their other citation needed medieval europe compound sodium clarification needed with the latin name sodanum was used headache citation needed while potash has been used since ancient was not understood for most its history fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him suggest the fundamental difference sodium and potassium salts and henri louis duhamel monceau was able prove this difference the exact chemical composition potassium and sodium and the status chemical element potassium and was not known and thus antoine lavoisier did include the alkali his list chemical elements pure potassium was first isolated england sir humphry davy who derived from caustic potash potassium the use electrolysis the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts electrolysis the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due extreme potassium was the first metal that was isolated later that same davy reported extraction sodium from the similar substance caustic soda lye similar demonstrating the and thus the later that the first pieces pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared humphry davy through the electrolysis molten caustic soda now called sodium petalite was discovered the brazilian chemist jos bonif cio andrada mine the island sweden however was not until that johan august arfwedson then working the laboratory the chemist jacob berzelius detected the presence new element while analyzing petalite this new element was noted him form compounds similar those sodium and though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble water and more alkaline than the other alkali berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion lithina from the greek word transliterated lithos meaning stone reflect its discovery solid opposed which had been discovered plant and which was known partly for its high abundance animal named the metal inside the material lithium rubidium and caesium were the first elements discovered using the spectroscope invented robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next they discovered caesium the mineral water from bad rkheim germany their discovery rubidium came the following year germany finding the mineral lepidolite the names rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines their emission spectra bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red bright and blue line for caesium derived from the latin word caesius meaning note there were least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey the curie institute france discovered francium purifying sample actinium which had been reported have decay energy kev however perey noticed decay particles with energy level below perey thought this decay activity might have been caused previously unidentified decay one that was separated during but emerged again out the pure actinium various tests eliminated the possibility the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties alkali metal such coprecipitating with caesium which led perey believe that was element caused the alpha decay perey then attempted determine the proportion beta decay alpha decay her first test put the alpha branching figure that she later revised was the last element discovered nature rather than note the next element below francium eka very likely ununennium

contain only rubidium and other alkali caesium more abundant than some commonly known such antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but much less abundant than francium the only naturally occurring isotope the product the alpha decay and can found trace amounts uranium and thorium minerals given sample there estimated only one francium atom for every uranium has been calculated that there most francium the earth crust any due its extremely short half life minutes production and isolation salt flats uyuni solar evaporation ponds the production pure alkali metals difficult due their extreme reactivity with commonly used such the alkali metals are reactive that they cannot displaced other elements and must isolated through energy methods such lithium salts have extracted from the water mineral springs brine pools and brine the metal produced electrolytically from mixture fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride potassium occurs many such sylvite potassium chloride occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine potassium but more often produced through electrolysis potassium hydroxide found extensively places such canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan method similar how sodium was produced the late and early can also produced from seawater sodium occurs mostly seawater and dried seabed but now produced through electrolysis sodium chloride lowering the melting point the substance below through the use downs cell extremely pure sodium can produced through the thermal decomposition sodium azide uraninite for several years the and product the potassium production called alkarb was main source for alkarb contained rubidium while the rest was potassium and small fraction today the largest producers for example the tanco mine manitoba canada produce rubidium product from pollucite today common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium the fractional crystallization rubidium and caesium alum which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately different the limited applications and the lack mineral rich rubidium limits the production rubidium compounds tonnes per caesium however not produced from the above instead the mining pollucite ore the main method obtaining pure extracted from the ore mainly three acid alkaline and direct both metals are produced byproducts lithium after when interest thermonuclear properties increased the production rubidium and caesium also increased francium the only naturally occurring isotope produced naturally the product the alpha decay actinium francium can found trace amounts uranium and thorium minerals has been calculated that most there are francium the earth crust any given result its extreme rarity most francium synthesized the nuclear reaction yielding francium francium and francium the greatest quantity francium ever assembled date about neutral which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given from their silicate ores all the alkali metals may obtained the same sulfuric acid first used dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium ions from the ore whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture precipitating the hydroxide the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate then precipitated the salt then dissolved hydrochloric acid the result then left evaporate and the alkali metal can then isolated through electrolysis lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid with calcium chloride typically added lower the melting point the the heavier alkali however more typically isolated different where reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium calcium for the heaviest alkali used reduce the alkali metal the liquid gaseous product the alkali then undergoes fractional distillation for applications all the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many lithium often used batteries and lithium oxide can help process lithium can also used make lubricating air and aluminium pure sodium has many including use sodium vapour lamps which produce very efficient light compared other types and can help smooth the surface other being strong reducing often used reduce many other such titanium and zirconium from their sodium compounds have many applications the most known compound being table salt citation needed sodium also used soap salts fatty acids citation needed potassium compounds are often used fertilisers potassium important element for plant other potassium ions are often used hold anions citation needed clarification needed potassium hydroxide very strong and used control the various rubidium and caesium are often used atomic clocks caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily clock had been made the time the would off less than four seconds after million for that caesium atoms are used the definition the rubidium ions are often used purple fireworks and caesium often used drilling fluids the petroleum francium has commercial but because relatively simple atomic structure among other has been used spectroscopy experiments leading more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies the light emitted trapped ions have provided accurate data transitions between atomic energy similar those predicted quantum theory biological role and precautions lithium carbonate lithium naturally only occurs traces biological systems and has known biological but does have effects the body when lithium carbonate used mood stabiliser psychiatry treat bipolar disorder manic depression daily doses about although there are excessive ingestion lithium causes slurred speech and among other and poisons the central nervous system which dangerous the required dosage lithium treat bipolar disorder only slightly lower than the toxic its the way handled the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that essential trace element although the natural biological function lithium humans has yet sodium and potassium occur all known biological generally functioning electrolytes inside and outside cells sodium essential nutrient that regulates blood blood osmotic equilibrium and the minimum physiological requirement for sodium milligrams per sodium chloride also known common the principal source sodium the and used seasoning and such for pickling and jerky most comes from processed the dri for sodium grams per but most people the united states consume more than grams per the minimum amount that promotes this turn causes million premature deaths potassium the major cation positive inside animal cells while sodium the major cation outside animal the concentration differences these charged particles causes difference electric potential between the inside and outside known the membrane potential the balance between potassium and sodium maintained ion pumps the cell membrane the cell membrane potential created potassium and sodium ions allows the cell generate action potential spike electrical the ability cells produce electrical discharge critical for body functions such neurotransmission muscle and heart collimator rubidium has known biological but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly replace potassium the body causing potassium deficiency caesium compounds are rarely encountered most but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because chemical similarity caesium allowing the caesium replace the potassium the causing potassium exposure large amounts caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasms but such amounts would not ordinarily encountered natural caesium not major chemical environmental the median lethal dose value for caesium chloride mice per which comparable the values potassium chloride and sodium chloride caesium chloride has been promoted alternative cancer but has been linked the deaths over patients whom was used part scientifically unvalidated cancer radioisotopes caesium require special the improper handling gamma ray sources can lead release this radioisotope and radiation perhaps the known case the nia accident which radiation therapy system from abandoned clinic the city goi nia brazil was scavenged from and the glowing caesium salt sold uneducated this led four deaths and serious injuries from radiation together with caesium iodine and strontium caesium was among the isotopes distributed the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk francium has biological role and most likely toxic due its extreme causing radiation poisoning but since the greatest quantity francium ever assembled date about neutral unlikely that most people will ever encounter
