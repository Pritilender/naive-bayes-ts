chemistry	amount substance navigation search amount substance defined quantity that measures the size ensemble elementary such molecules electrons and other macroscopic property and sometimes referred chemical amount the international system units defines the amount substance proportional the number elementary entities present the unit for amount substance the mole has the unit symbol the mole defined the amount substance that contains equal number elementary entities there are atoms the isotope carbon this number called number and has the value the numerical value the avogadro constant which has the unit and relates the molar mass amount substance its amount substance appears thermodynamic relations such the ideal gas law and stoichiometric relations between reacting molecules the law multiple proportions the only other unit amount substance current use the pound mole with the symbol which sometimes used chemical engineering the united one mole exactly mol notes the amount substance sample can calculated where the mass grams and the molar mass mol contents terminology derived quantities history notes see also references terminology amount when quoting amount necessary specify the entity unless there risk one mole chlorine could refer either chlorine sodium chloride chlorine liters chlorine gas stp the simplest way avoid ambiguity replace the term substance the name the entity quote the empirical formula for amount chloroform chcl amount sodium amount hydrogen this can considered technical definition the word amount usage which also found the names certain derived quantities see derived quantities when amount substance enters into derived usually the such quantities are known molar for the quantity which describes the volume occupied given amount substance called the molar volume while the quantity which describes the mass given amount substance the molar mass molar quantities are sometimes denoted subscript latin the molar heat capacity constant the subscript may omitted there risk often the case pure chemistry the main derived quantity which amount substance enters into the numerator amount substance concentration this name often abbreviated amount except clinical chemistry where substance the preferred term avoid any possible ambiguity with mass concentration the name molar commonly history the alchemists and especially the early metallurgists probably had some notion amount but there are surviving records any generalization the idea beyond set mikhail lomonosov questioned the idea that mass was the only measure the quantity but did only relation his theories gravitation the development the concept amount substance was coincidental and vital the birth modern wenzel publishes lessons affinity which demonstrates that the proportions the base and the acid cation and anion modern remain the same during reactions between two neutral salts lavoisier publishes treatise elementary chemistry introducing the concept chemical element and clarifying the law conservation mass for chemical richter publishes the first volume stoichiometry the art measuring the chemical elements publication subsequent volumes continues until the term stoichiometry used for the first the first tables equivalent weights are published for acid base reactions richter also notes for given the equivalent mass the acid proportional the mass oxygen the proust law definite proportions generalizes the concept equivalent weights all types chemical not simply base dalton publishes his first paper modern atomic theory including table the relative weights the ultimate particles gaseous and other publication new system chemical philosophy containing the first table atomic weights based gay law combining volumes stating integer relationship between the volumes reactants and products the chemical reactions avogadro hypothesizes that equal volumes different gases contain equal numbers now known avogadro law berzelius publishes the first several tables atomic weights based the scale prout publishes his hypothesis that all atomic weights are integer multiple the atomic weight the hypothesis later abandoned given the observed atomic weight chlorine relative dulong petit law relating the atomic weight solid element its specific heat capacity mitscherlich work crystal isomorphism allows many chemical formulae resolving several ambiguities the calculation atomic clapeyron states the ideal gas ideal gas law faraday states his laws electrolysis particular that the chemical decomposing action current constant for constant quantity electricity nig derives the ideal gas law from kinetic theory clausius publishes independent derivation the following the karlsruhe congress debates the relation between physical chemical and without reaching loschmidt makes the first estimate the size gas molecules and hence number molecules given volume now known the loschmidt constant van hoff demonstrates the similarities behaviour between dilute solutions and ideal eugen goldstein observed discrete particle rays gas discharges that laid the foundation mass spectrometry tool later used establish the masses atoms and arrhenius describes the dissociation electrolyte resolving one the problems the study colligative first recorded use the term mole describe unit amount substance ostwald university first recorded use the term mole the turn the twentieth century the concept atomic and molecular entities was generally but many questions not least the size atoms and their number given the concurrent development mass spectrometry starting supported the concept atomic and molecular mass and provided tool direct relative einstein paper brownian motion dispels any last doubts the physical reality and opens the way for accurate determination their perrin coins the name avogadro constant and estimates its discovery isotopes radioactive elements soddy and thomson richards receives the nobel prize chemistry for his determinations the atomic weight large number aston proposes the whole number rule updated version prout hypothesis soddy receives the nobel prize chemistry for his work the chemistry radioactive substances and investigations into aston receives the nobel prize chemistry for his discovery isotopes large number radioactive and for his number perrin receives the nobel prize physics part for his
