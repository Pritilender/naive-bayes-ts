using pressurized carbon sometimes mixed with wine making carbon dioxide the form dry ice often used the wine making process cool down bunches grapes quickly after picking help prevent spontaneous fermentation wild yeast the main advantage using dry ice over regular water ice that cools the grapes without adding any additional water that may decrease the sugar concentration the grape must and therefore also decrease the alcohol concentration the finished dry ice also used during the cold soak phase the wine making process keep grapes the carbon dioxide gas that results from the sublimation the dry ice tends settle the bottom tanks because denser than the settled carbon dioxide gas creates hypoxic environment which helps prevent bacteria from growing the grapes until time start the
