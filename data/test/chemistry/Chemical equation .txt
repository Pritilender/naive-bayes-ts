chemistry	chemical equation navigation search this article relies largely entirely upon single source relevant discussion may found the talk page please help improve this article introducing citations additional september chemical equation the symbolic representation chemical reaction wherein the reactant entities are given the hand side and the product entities the hand the coefficients next the symbols and formulae entities are the absolute values the stoichiometric numbers the first chemical equation was diagrammed jean beguin contents form common symbols balancing chemical equations ionic equations references form chemical equation consists the chemical formulas the reactants the starting and the chemical formula the products substances formed the chemical the two are separated arrow symbol usually read yields and each individual chemical formula separated from others plus sign the equation for the reaction hydrochloric acid with sodium can hcl nacl this equation would read two hcl plus two yields two nacl and but for equations involving complex rather than reading the letter and its the chemical formulas are read using iupac nomenclature using iupac this equation would read hydrochloric acid plus sodium yields sodium chloride and hydrogen gas this equation indicates that sodium and hcl react form nacl and also indicates that two sodium molecules are required for every two hydrochloric acid molecules and the reaction will form two sodium chloride molecules and one diatomic molecule hydrogen gas molecule for every two hydrochloric acid and two sodium molecules that the stoichiometric coefficients the numbers front the chemical result from the law conservation mass and the law conservation charge see balancing chemical section below for more common symbols symbols are used differentiate between different types denote the type symbol used denote stoichiometric relation symbol used denote net forward symbol used denote reaction both symbol used denote equilibrium physical state chemicals also very commonly stated parentheses after the chemical especially for ionic when stating physical denotes denotes denotes gas and denotes aqueous solution the reaction requires indicated above the capital greek letter delta put the reaction arrow show that energy the form heat added the used the energy added the form balancing chemical equations oxygen water the law conservation mass dictates that the quantity each element does not change chemical thus each side the chemical equation must represent the same quantity any particular likewise the charge conserved chemical therefore the same charge must present both sides the balanced one balances chemical equation changing the scalar number for each chemical simple chemical equations can balanced that trial and another technique involves solving system linear equations balanced equations are written with smallest number there coefficient before chemical the coefficient the method inspection can outlined putting coefficient front the most complex chemical formula and putting the other coefficients before everything else such that both sides the arrows have the same number each any fractional coefficient multiply every coefficient with the smallest number required make them typically the denominator the fractional coefficient for reaction with single fractional seen the above the burning methane would balanced putting coefficient before the since there one carbon each side the the first atom looking the next atom the hand side has two while the hand side has balance the goes front the which inspection the last atom balanced shows that the hand side has four while the hand side has can balanced putting before giving the balanced this equation does not have any coefficients front and since coefficient ionic equations ionic equation chemical equation which electrolytes are written dissociated ions ionic equations are used for single and double displacement reactions that occur aqueous solutions for example the following precipitation the full ionic equation this the and the ions remain solution and are not part the that these ions are identical both the reactant and product side the chemical because such ions not participate the they are called spectator ions net ionic equation the full ionic equation from which the spectator ions have been the net ionic equation the proceeding reactions reduced balanced neutralization acid base reaction the net ionic equation will usually there are few base reactions that produce precipitate addition the water molecule shown example the reaction barium hydroxide with phosphoric acid which produces not only water but also the insoluble salt barium this there are spectator the net ionic equation the same the full ionic double displacement reactions that feature carbonate reacting with acid have the net ionic every ion spectator then there was and the net ionic equation
