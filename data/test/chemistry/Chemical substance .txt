chemical substance navigation search chemical chemistry chemical substance form matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic cannot separated into components physical separation without breaking chemical can liquid gas chemical substances are often called set them apart from common example chemical substance pure water has the same properties and the same ratio hydrogen oxygen whether isolated from river made laboratory other chemical substances commonly encountered pure form are diamond gold table salt sodium chloride and refined sugar sucrose however simple seemingly pure substances found nature can fact mixtures chemical for tap water may contain small amounts dissolved sodium chloride and compounds containing calcium and many other chemical chemical substances exist solids liquids gases plasma and may change between these phases matter with changes temperature pressure chemical reactions convert one chemical substance into forms energy such light and heat are not considered and thus they are not substances this contents definition history chemical elements chemical compounds substances versus mixtures chemicals versus chemical substances naming and indexing isolation purification characterization and identification see also notes and references external links definition nile red chemical substances also called pure may well defined any material with definite chemical introductory general chemistry according this definition chemical substance can either pure chemical element pure chemical but there are exceptions this pure substance can also defined form matter that has both definite composition and distinct the chemical substance index published cas also includes several alloys uncertain non stoichiometric compounds are special case inorganic that violates the law constant and for sometimes difficult draw the line between mixture and the case palladium hydride broader definitions chemicals chemical substances can for the term chemical means any organic inorganic substance particular molecular including any combination such substances occurring whole part result chemical reaction occurring geology substances uniformion are called minerals while physical mixtures several minerals different are defined rocks many however mutually dissolve into solid solutions such that single rock uniform substance despite feldspars are common anorthoclase alkali aluminium where the alkali metal interchangeably either sodium history the concept chemical became firmly established the late eighteenth century after work the chemist joseph proust the composition some pure chemical compounds such basic copper carbonate deduced all samples compound have the same that all samples have the same the elements present the this now known the law constant composition later with the advancement methods for chemical synthesis particularly the realm organic chemistry the discovery many more chemical elements and new techniques the realm analytical chemistry used for isolation and purification elements and compounds from chemicals that led the establishment modern chemistry the concept was defined found most chemistry however there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number chemical substances reported chemistry literature need isomerism caused much consternation early since isomers have exactly the same but differ configuration the for there was much speculation for the chemical identity benzene until the correct structure was described friedrich august likewise the idea stereoisomerism that atoms have rigid dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only their dimensional arrangement was another crucial step understanding the concept distinct chemical for tartaric acid has three distinct pair diastereomers with one diastereomer forming two enantiomers chemical elements sulfide sulfate hydrogen sulfide chemical element list elements element chemical substance that made particular kind atoms and hence cannot broken down transformed chemical reaction into different though can transmutated into another element through nuclear reaction this because all the atoms sample element have the same number though they may different isotopes with differing numbers there are known about which are stable that they not change radioactive decay into other some elements can occur more than single chemical substance allotropes for oxygen exists both diatomic oxygen and ozone the majority elements are classified metals these are elements with characteristic lustre such iron copper and gold metals typically conduct electricity and heat and they are malleable and ductile around dozen such carbon nitrogen and oxygen are classified non metals non metals lack the metallic properties described they also have high electronegativity and tendency form negative ions certain elements such silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble and are known metalloids chemical compounds potassium ferricyanide chemical compound list organic compounds list inorganic compounds pure chemical compound chemical substance that composed particular set molecules ions two more elements combined into one substance through chemical reaction form chemical compound all compounds are but not all substances are chemical compound can either atoms bonded together molecules crystals which molecules ions form crystalline lattice compounds based primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic compounds and all others are called inorganic compounds compounds containing bonds between carbon and metal are called organometallic compounds compounds which components share electrons are known covalent compounds compounds consisting oppositely charged ions are known ionic compounds salts organic there can more than one chemical compound with the same composition and molecular generally these are called isomers isomers usually have substantially different chemical may isolated and not spontaneously convert each common example glucose fructose the former aldehyde the latter ketone their interconversion requires either enzymatic acid base catalysis however there are also tautomers where isomerization occurs such that pure substance cannot isolated into its common example glucose which has chain and ring one cannot manufacture pure chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes the hemiacetal form substances versus mixtures gold mixture all matter consists various elements and chemical but these are often intimately mixed mixtures contain more than one chemical and they not have fixed they can separated into the component substances purely mechanical processes butter soil and wood are common examples grey iron metal and yellow sulfur are both chemical and they can mixed together any ratio form grey chemical process and the material can identified mixture the fact that the sulfur and the iron can separated mechanical such using magnet attract the iron away from the iron and sulfur are heated together certain ratio atom iron for each atom grams mol iron grams chemical reaction takes place and new substance the compound iron sulfide with chemical formula the resulting compound has all the properties chemical substance and not iron sulfide has its own distinct properties such melting point and solubility and the two elements cannot separated using normal mechanical magnet will unable recover the since there metallic iron present the chemicals versus chemical substances while the term chemical substance precise technical term that synonymous with chemical for professional the meaning the word chemical varies for chemists within the english speaking world those using for government and society general some the word chemical includes wider class substances that contain many mixtures such chemical often finding application many countries that require list ingredients the chemicals listed would equated with chemical within the chemical manufactured chemicals are chemical which can classified production volume into bulk fine chemicals and chemicals found research bulk chemicals are produced very large usually with highly optimized continuous processes and relatively low fine chemicals are produced high cost small quantities for special volume applications such pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for technical research chemicals are produced individually for such when searching for synthetic routes screening substances for pharmaceutical their price per gram very although they are not the cause the difference production volume the complexity the molecular structure the bulk chemicals are usually much less while fine chemicals may more many them are simple enough sold building the synthesis more complex molecules targeted for single named the production chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification eliminate products and impurities involved the the last step production should the analysis batch lots chemicals order identify and quantify the percentages impurities for the buyer the the required purity and analysis depends the but higher tolerance impurities usually expected the production bulk thus the user the chemical the might choose between the bulk technical with higher amounts impurities much purer pharmaceutical labeled usp united states pharmacopeia naming and indexing every chemical substance has one more systematic names usually named according the iupac rules for naming alternative system used the chemical abstracts service many compounds are also known their more simpler many which predate the systematic for the known sugar glucose now systematically named natural products and pharmaceuticals are also given simpler for example the mild killer naproxen the more common name for the chemical compound naphthaleneacetic chemists frequently refer chemical compounds using chemical formulae molecular structure the there has been phenomenal growth the number chemical compounds being synthesized and then reported the scientific literature professional chemists around the enormous number chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination the known chemical may about sixty million chemical compounds are the names many these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy remember cite also difficult keep the track them the several international organizations like iupac and cas have initiated steps make such tasks cas provides the abstracting services the chemical and provides numerical known cas registry number each chemical substance that has been reported the chemical literature such chemistry journals and patents this information compiled database and popularly known the chemical substances other friendly systems that have been developed for substance are smiles and the international chemical identifier systematic name chemical formula chemical structure cas registry number inchi purification characterization and identification often pure substance needs isolated from mixture for example from natural source where sample often contains numerous chemical after chemical reaction which often give mixtures chemical see also chemistry portal chemical safety signs iupac nomenclature prices
