thus event marker water soil and groundwater also useful for dating waters less than years before the has seen use other areas the geological including dating ice and history the most common compound sodium has been known since ancient archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used early and brine early around chlorine was recognized gas the belgian chemist and physician jan baptist van helmont elemental chlorine was first prepared and studied swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele and therefore credited for its called dephlogisticated muriatic acid air since gas then called airs and came from hydrochloric acid then known muriatic however failed establish chlorine mistakenly thinking that was the oxide obtained from the hydrochloric acid see phlogiston theory named the new element within this oxide muriaticum regardless what scheele did isolate chlorine reacting mno the mineral pyrolusite with scheele observed several the properties the bleaching effect litmus the deadly effect the yellow green and the smell similar aqua regia the common chemical theory any acid compound that contains oxygen still sounding the german and dutch names oxygen sauerstoff zuurstof both translating into english acid stuff number including claude berthollet suggested that dephlogisticated muriatic acid air must combination oxygen and the yet undiscovered muriaticum joseph louis lussac and louis jacques nard tried decompose dephlogisticated muriatic acid air reacting with charcoal release the free element muriaticum and carbon they did not succeed and published report which they considered the possibility that dephlogisticated muriatic acid air but were not sir humphry davy tried the same experiment and concluded that and not named this new element from the greek word chl ros meaning the name halogen meaning salt was originally used for chlorine johann salomo christoph schweigger however this term was later used generic term describe all the elements the chlorine family bromine iodine after suggestion jakob berzelius michael faraday liquefied chlorine for the first and demonstrated that what was then known solid had structure chlorine hydrate chlorine gas was first used french chemist claude berthollet bleach textiles modern bleaches resulted from further work who first produced sodium hypochlorite his laboratory the town javel now part paris france passing chlorine gas through solution sodium the resulting known eau javel javel water was weak solution sodium hypochlorite however this process was not very and alternative production methods were scottish chemist and industrialist charles tennant first produced solution calcium hypochlorite chlorinated then solid calcium hypochlorite bleaching these compounds produced low levels elemental and could more efficiently transported than sodium which remained dilute solutions because when purified eliminate became dangerously powerful and unstable near the end the nineteenth smith patented method sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis brine produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine which then mixed form sodium this known the chloralkali process first introduced industrial scale and now the source essentially all modern elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide production related temperature electrolysis the hooker process now responsible for bleach and sodium hypochlorite production elemental chlorine solutions dissolved chemically basic water sodium and calcium hypochlorite were first used putrification agents and disinfectants the long before the establishment the germ theory disease this work mainly due antoine germain labarraque who adapted javel bleach and other chlorine preparations for the purpose for more complete see elemental chlorine has since served continuous function topical antisepsis wound irrigation solutions and the well public sanitation especially swimming and drinking silver chloride was used produce photographic images for the first chloroform was first used anesthetic polyvinyl chloride was invented initially without chlorine gas was first introduced weapon april ypres the german army and the results this weapon were disastrous because gas masks had not been mass distributed and were tricky get production chlorine production chloralkali process elemental chlorine usually produced the electrolysis sodium chloride dissolved this the chloralkali process industrialized now provides essentially all industrial chlorine along with the method yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide actually being the most crucial the three industrial products produced the the process proceeds according the following chemical equation the electrolysis chloride solutions all proceed according the following overall nacl naoh diaphragm cell asbestos diaphragm separates cathode and anode preventing the chlorine forming the anode from mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed the the salt solution continuously fed the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm the cathode where the caustic alkali produced and the brine partially diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they are more energy membrane cell electrolysis employ permeable membrane ion exchanger saturated sodium chloride solution passed through the anode leaving lower concentration this method more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium hydroxide about concentration but requires very pure laboratory methods small amounts chlorine gas can made the laboratory combining hydrochloric acid and manganese alternatively strong acid such sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hypochlorite solution release chlorine gas but reacts with sodium chlorate produce chlorine gas and chlorine dioxide gas the accidents occur when hypochlorite bleach solutions are combined with certain acidic applications production industrial and consumer products principal applications chlorine are the production wide range industrial and consumer for used making solvents for dry cleaning and metal textiles agrochemicals and insecticides dyestuffs household cleaning etc many important industrial products are produced via organochlorine examples include polycarbonates polyurethanes silicones polytetrafluoroethylene carboxymethyl cellulose and propylene oxide like the other chlorine participates free radical substitution reactions with containing organic when applied organic reaction but not and hence may result mixture isomeric often difficult control the degree substitution multiple substitutions are the different reaction products are easily substitutive radical chlorination some cases accompanied concurrent thermal may useful synthetic industrial examples this are the production methyl chloride methylene chloride chloroform and carbon tetrachloride from allyl chloride from and trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene from dichloroethane quantitatively about and all elemental chlorine produced used the manufacture organic and inorganic chlorine respectively about chlorine compounds are being used the remaining used for bleaches and disinfection the most significant organic compounds terms production volume are dichloroethane and vinyl chloride intermediates the production pvc other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride methylene chloride chloroform vinylidene chloride

need process animal guts order make musical instrument goldbeater skin and other this was carried out gut boyauderies odiferous and unhealthy about the soci encouragement pour industrie nationale offered prize for the discovery chemical that could used separate the peritoneal membrane animal intestines without causing was won antoine germain labarraque year old french chemist and pharmacist who had discovered that chlorinated bleaching solutions eau javel not only destroyed the smell putrefaction animal tissue but also retarded the decomposition process labarraque research resulted chlorides and hypochlorites lime calcium hypochlorite and sodium sodium hypochlorite being employed not only the boyauderies but also for the routine disinfection and deodorisation latrines sewers markets abattoirs anatomical theatres and they were also with lazarets prisons infirmaries both land and magnaneries stables cattle etc and for exhumations embalming during outbreaks epidemic fever blackleg etc against infection and contagion labarraque chlorinated lime and soda solutions have been advocated since prevent infection called contagious and presumed transmitted miasmas and also treat putrefaction existing including septic this work labarraque recommended for the doctor breathe wash his hands with chlorinated and even sprinkle chlorinated lime about the cases contagious was well known that some infections were even though the agency the microbe was not realized discovered for more than half during the paris cholera outbreak large quantities called chloride lime were used disinfect the this was not simply modern calcium chloride but contained chlorine gas dissolved water dilute calcium hydroxide form calcium hypochlorite chlorinated labarraque discovery helped remove the terrible stench decay from hospitals and dissecting and doing effectively deodorised the latin quarter these putrid were thought many responsible for the spread contagion and infection both words used before the germ theory the use chloride lime was based destruction odors and putrid one source has claimed that chloride lime was used john snow disinfect water from the contaminated well feeding the broad street pump london three reputable sources that described the famous broad street pump cholera epidemic not mention snow performing any disinfection water from that instead one reference makes clear that chloride lime was used disinfect the offal and filth the streets surrounding the broad street common practice nineteenth century semmelweis and experiments with antisepsis perhaps the most famous application chlorine and chemical base solutions was when ignaz semmelweis used chlorine water simply chlorine dissolved pure then cheaper chlorinated lime deodorize the hands austrian which semmelweis noticed still carried the stench decomposition from the dissection rooms the patient examination semmelweis still long before the germ theory had theorized that cadaveric were somehow transmitting decay from fresh medical cadavers living and used the known the only known method remove the smell decay and tissue decomposition which found that soap did the solutions proved far more effective germicide antiseptics than soap semmelweis was also aware their greater but not the and this resulted celebrated success stopping the transmission childbed fever puerperal the maternity wards vienna general hospital austria much during world war standardized and diluted modification containing hypochlorite and boric acid acidic was developed henry drysdale dakin who gave full credit prior work this called dakin solution the method wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment wide variety open long before the modern antibiotic modified version this solution continues employed wound irrigation the modern where remains effective against multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria see century pharmaceuticals public sanitation the department treasury called for all drinking water disinfected with chlorine presently important chemical for water purification such water treatment disinfectants and bleach chlorine water more than three times effective disinfectant against escherichia coli than equivalent concentration bromine and more than six times more effective than equivalent concentration iodine chlorine usually used the form hypochlorous acid kill bacteria and other microbes drinking water supplies and public swimming most private swimming chlorine itself not but rather sodium hypochlorite formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide solid tablets chlorinated the drawback using chlorine swimming pools that the chlorine reacts with the proteins human hair and skin see hypochlorous acid once the chlorine reacts with the hair and becomes chemically even small water supplies are now routinely often impractical store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water alternative methods adding chlorine are these include hypochlorite solutions which gradually release chlorine into the and compounds like sodium triazinetrione dihydrate sometimes referred dichlor and trichloro triazinetrione sometimes referred trichlor these compounds are stable while solid and may used granular tablet when added small amounts pool water industrial water the chlorine atoms hydrolyze from the rest the molecule forming hypochlorous acid which acts

damage done chlorine gas can prevented the activated charcoal commonly found gas masks other filtration which makes the overall chance death chlorine gas much lower than those other chemical was pioneered german scientist later nobel fritz haber the kaiser wilhelm institute collaboration with the german chemical conglomerate farben who developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against entrenched enemy alleged that role the use chlorine deadly weapon drove his clara immerwahr after its first chlorine was utilized both sides chemical but was soon replaced the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas iraq war chlorine bombings iraq chlorine gas has also been used insurgents against the local population and coalition forces the iraq war the form chlorine bombs march for three filled trucks were detonated the anbar province killing two and sickening over other chlorine bomb attacks resulted higher death with more than deaths two separate most the deaths were caused the force the explosions rather than the effects since the toxic gas readily dispersed and diluted the atmosphere the the iraqi authorities have tightened security for elemental which essential for providing safe
