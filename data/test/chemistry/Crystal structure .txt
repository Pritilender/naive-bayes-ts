its unit the unit cell small box containing one more atoms arranged the unit cells stacked dimensional space describe the bulk arrangement atoms the the unit cell represented terms its lattice parameters which are the lengths the cell edges and and the angles between them beta and while the positions the atoms inside the unit cell are described the set atomic positions measured from lattice commonly atomic positions are represented terms fractional relative the unit cell simple cubic body centered cubic face centered cubic the atom positions within the unit cell can calculated through application symmetry operations the asymmetric the asymmetric unit refers the smallest possible occupation space within the unit this does however imply that the entirety the asymmetric unit must lie within the boundaries the unit symmetric transformations atom positions are calculated from the space group the crystal and this usually black box operation performed computer however manual calculation the atomic positions within the unit cell can performed from the asymmetric through the application the symmetry operators described within the international tables for volume miller indices miller index vectors and atomic planes crystal lattice can described value miller index notation the and directional indices are separated and are thus denotes plane that intercepts the three points and some multiple that the miller indices are proportional the inverses the intercepts the plane with the unit cell the basis the lattice one more the indices means that the planes not intersect that axis the intercept plane containing ordinate axis translated that longer contains that axis before its miller indices are the miller indices for plane are integers with common negative indices are indicated with horizontal orthogonal ordinate system for cubic the miller indices plane are the cartesian components vector normal the considering only planes intersecting one more lattice points the lattice planes the perpendicular distance between adjacent lattice planes related the reciprocal lattice vector orthogonal the planes the planes and directions the crystallographic directions are geometric lines linking nodes atoms ions molecules likewise the crystallographic planes are geometric planes linking some directions and planes have higher density these high density planes have influence the behavior the crystal optical properties refractive index directly related density periodic density adsorption and reactivity physical adsorption and chemical reactions occur near surface atoms these phenomena are thus sensitive the density surface tension the condensation material means that the ions molecules are more stable they are surrounded other similar the surface tension interface thus varies according the density the microstructural defects pores and crystallites tend have straight grain boundaries following higher density cleavage this typically occurs preferentially parallel higher density plastic deformation dislocation glide occurs preferentially parallel higher density the perturbation carried the dislocation burgers vector along dense the shift one node more dense direction requires lesser distortion the crystal some directions and planes are defined symmetry the crystal rombohedral tetragonal and hexagonal systems there one unique axis sometimes called the principal axis which has higher rotational symmetry than the other two the basal plane the plane perpendicular the principal axis these crystal for orthorhombic and cubic crystal systems the axis designation arbitrary and there principal cubic structures for the special case simple cubic the lattice vectors are orthogonal and equal length usually denoted similarly for the reciprocal this common the miller indices and both simply denote directions cartesian coordinates for cubic crystals with lattice constant the spacing between adjacent lattice planes from because the symmetry cubic possible change the place and sign the integers and have equivalent directions and coordinates angle brackets such denote family directions that are equivalent due symmetry such the negative any those coordinates curly brackets braces such denote family plane normals that are equivalent due symmetry much the way angle brackets denote family for face centered cubic and body centered cubic lattices the primitive lattice vectors are not however these cases the miller indices are conventionally defined relative the lattice vectors the cubic supercell and hence are again simply the cartesian directions classification the defining property crystal its inherent which mean that under certain the crystal remains all crystals have translational symmetry three but some have other symmetry elements for rotating the crystal about certain axis may result atomic configuration that identical the original the crystal then said have twofold rotational symmetry about this addition rotational symmetries like crystal may have symmetries the form mirror planes and translational symmetries and also the called compound which are combination translation and mirror full classification crystal achieved when all these inherent symmetries the crystal are lattice systems these lattice systems are grouping crystal structures according the axial system used describe their each lattice system consists set three axes particular geometric there are seven lattice they are similar but not quite the same the seven crystal systems and the six crystal families the lattice systems from least most the bravais lattices triclinic monoclinic orthorhombic rhombohedral tetragonal hexagonal cubic centered centered the simplest and most the cubic system has the symmetry cube that exhibits four threefold rotational axes oriented the tetrahedral angle with respect each these threefold axes lie along the body diagonals the the other six lattice are hexagonal tetragonal rhombohedral often confused with the trigonal crystal system orthorhombic monoclinic and triclinic atomic coordination considering the arrangement atoms relative each their coordination numbers number nearest interatomic types etc possible form general view the structures and alternative ways visualizing close packing the principles involved can understood considering the most efficient way packing together sized spheres and stacking close packed atomic planes three for plane lies beneath plane there are two possible ways placing additional atom top layer additional layer was placed directly over plane this would give rise the following abababab this arrangement atoms crystal structure known hexagonal close packing however all three planes are staggered relative each other and not until the fourth layer positioned directly over plane that the sequence then the following sequence abcabcabc this type structural arrangement known cubic close packing the unit cell ccp arrangement atoms the centered cubic unit this not immediately obvious the closely packed layers are parallel the planes the fcc unit there are four different orientations the packed the packing efficiency can worked out calculating the total volume the spheres and dividing the volume the cell the packing efficiency the maximum density possible unit cells constructed spheres only one most crystalline forms metallic elements are fcc bcc centered the coordination number atoms hcp and fcc structures and its atomic packing factor the number mentioned this can compared the apf bcc which bravais lattices bravais lattice when the crystal systems are combined with the various possible lattice arrive the bravais lattices they describe the geometric arrangement the lattice and thereby the translational symmetry the three there are unique bravais lattices that are distinct from one another the translational symmetry they all crystalline materials recognized until now not including quasicrystals fit one these the fourteen dimensional classified crystal are shown the bravais lattices are sometimes referred space lattices the crystal structure consists the same group the basis positioned around each and every lattice this group atoms therefore repeats indefinitely three dimensions according the arrangement one the bravais the characteristic rotation and mirror symmetries the group unit cell described its crystallographic point group point groups the crystallographic point group crystal class the mathematical group comprising the symmetry operations that leave least one point unmoved and that leave the appearance the crystal structure these symmetry operations include reflection which reflects the structure across reflection plane rotation which rotates the structure specified portion circle about rotation axis inversion which changes the sign the coordinate each point with respect center symmetry inversion point improper rotation which consists rotation about axis followed rotation axes proper and reflection and centers symmetry are collectively called symmetry elements there are possible crystal each one can classified into one the seven crystal space groups addition the operations the point the space group the crystal structure contains translational symmetry these pure translations which move point along vector screw axes which rotate point around axis while translating parallel the glide planes which reflect point through plane while translating parallel the there are distinct space grain boundaries grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals different orientations grain boundary phase with crystals each side the boundary being identical except the term crystallite though used grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice dislocations and impurities that have migrated the lower energy grain treating grain boundary geometrically interface single crystal cut into two one which see that there are five variables required define grain the first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies rotation the third number designates the angle rotation the the final two numbers specify the plane the grain boundary unit vector that normal this grain boundaries disrupt the motion dislocations through reducing crystallite size common way improve described the hall petch relationship since grain boundaries are defects the crystal structure they tend decrease the electrical and thermal conductivity the the high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset corrosion and for the precipitation new phases from the they are also important many the mechanisms creep grain boundaries are general only few nanometers common crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for small fraction the however very small grain sizes are nanocrystalline grain boundaries become significant volume fraction the with profound effects such properties diffusion and plasticity the limit small the volume fraction grain boundaries approaches the material ceases have any crystalline and thus becomes amorphous solid defects and impurities real crystals feature defects irregularities the ideal arrangements described above and these defects that critically determine many the electrical and mechanical properties real when one atom substitutes for one the principal atomic components within the crystal alteration the electrical and thermal properties the material may impurities may also manifest spin impurities certain research magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration certain properties such specific heat may affected small concentrations for example impurities semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys may lead different properties first predicted the late dislocations the crystal lattice allow shear lower stress than that needed for perfect crystal prediction structure crystal structure prediction the difficulty predicting stable crystal structures based the knowledge only the chemical composition has long been stumbling block the way fully computational materials now with more powerful algorithms and performance structures medium complexity can predicted using such approaches evolutionary algorithms random the crystal structures simple ionic solids nacl table have long been rationalized terms pauling rules first set out linus pauling referred many since the father the chemical pauling also considered the nature the interatomic forces and concluded that about half the five orbitals the transition metals are involved with the remaining nonbonding orbitals being responsible for the magnetic therefore was able correlate the number orbitals bond formation with the bond length well many the physical properties the subsequently introduced the metallic extra orbital necessary permit uninhibited resonance valence bonds among various electronic the resonating valence bond theory the factors that determine the choice one from among alternative crystal structures metal intermetallic compound revolve around the energy resonance bonds among interatomic clear that some modes resonance would make larger contributions more mechanically stable than and that particular simple ratio number bonds number positions would the resulting principle that special stability associated with the simplest ratios bond etc the choice structure and the value the axial ratio which determines the relative bond are thus result the effort atom use its valency the formation stable bonds with simple fractional bond after postulating direct correlation between electron concentration and crystal structure phase hume rothery analyzed the trends melting compressibilities and bond lengths function group number the periodic table order establish system valencies the transition elements the metallic this treatment thus emphasized the increasing bond strength function group the operation directional forces were emphasized one article the relation between bond hybrids and the metallic the resulting correlation between electronic and crystalline structures summarized single the weight the electrons per hybridized metallic the calculates out and for the hcp and bcc structures the relationship between electrons and crystal structure thus becomes polymorphism quartz crystalline silica quartz quartz tridymite cristobalite coesite stishovite polymorphism refers the ability solid exist more than one crystalline form according rules phase these unique crystalline phases will dependent intensive variables such pressure and polymorphism can potentially found many crystalline materials including polymers minerals and metals and related allotropy which refers elemental solids the complete morphology material described polymorphism and other variables such crystal habit amorphous fraction crystallographic defects polymorphs have different stabilities and may spontaneously convert from metastable form thermodynamically unstable the stable form particular they also exhibit different melting points solubilities and ray diffraction patterns one good example this the quartz form silicon dioxide sio the vast majority silicates the atom shows tetrahedral coordination oxygens all but one the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral sio units linked together shared vertices different different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees networking and for they occur joined together larger finite clusters including double sheets and dimensional the minerals are classified into groups based these each its thermodynamically stable crystalline forms polymorphs crystalline only out each the edges the sio tetrahedra are shared with yielding the net chemical formula for sio another example elemental tin which malleable near ambient temperatures but brittle when this change mechanical properties due existence its two major allotropes and the two allotropes that are encountered normal pressure and tin and are more commonly known gray tin and white tin respectively two more and exist temperatures above and pressures above several white tin and the stable crystalline form above room below tin exists the gray which has diamond cubic crystal similar diamond silicon germanium gray tin has metallic properties gray powdery and has few other than few specialized semiconductor applications although the transformation temperature tin nominally impurities etc lower the transition temperature well below and upon addition the transformation may not occur physical properties twenty the crystal classes are piezoelectric and crystals belonging one these classes point display piezoelectricity all piezoelectric classes lack centre any material develops dielectric polarization when electric field but substance that has such natural charge separation even the absence field called polar whether not material polar determined solely its crystal only the point groups are polar all polar crystals are pyroelectric the polar crystal classes are sometimes referred the pyroelectric there are few crystal notably the perovskite structure which exhibit ferroelectric behavior this analogous ferromagnetism the absence electric field during the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit upon the
