chemistry	endothermic endothermic reaction navigation search endotherm thermodynamics the term endothermic describes process reaction which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings the form heat the term was coined marcellin berthelot from the greek roots endo derived from the word endon meaning within and the root therm meaning the intended sense that reaction that depends taking heat the opposite endothermic process exothermic process one that gives energy the form thus each term endothermic exothermic the prefix refers where heat goes the reaction the concept frequently applied physical sciences for chemical reactions where thermal energy converted chemical bond energy endothermic and analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change the full energy analysis reaction the gibbs free energy which includes entropy and temperature term addition the reaction could spontaneous process certain temperature the products have lower total free energy exergonic reaction even the enthalpy the products entropy and enthalpy are different the change entropic energy could overcome opposite change enthalpic contents contrast between thermodynamic and biological terminology examples see also references external links contrast between thermodynamic and biological terminology because historical students encounter possible source confusion between the terminology physics and whereas the thermodynamic terms exothermic and endothermic respectively refer processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat biology the sense effectively the metabolic terms ectothermic and endothermic respectively refer organisms that rely largely external heat achieve full working and organisms that produce heat from within major factor controlling their bodily examples photosynthesis cracking alkanes melting ice vaporising rubbing alcohol thermal decomposition reactions forming cation from atom the gas phase dissolving ammonium chloride water energy neutrons can also produce tritium from lithium endothermic consuming mev this was discovered when the castle bravo nuclear test produced unexpectedly high see also endergonic exothermic exergonic exergonic reaction
