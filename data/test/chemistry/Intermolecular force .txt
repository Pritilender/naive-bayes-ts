chemistry	intermolecular force navigation search intermolecular forces are forces attraction repulsion which act between neighboring particles molecules they are weak compared the intramolecular forces the forces which keep molecule for the covalent bond present within hcl molecules much stronger than the forces present between the neighboring which exist when the molecules are sufficiently close each bond has atom directly bonded either then then then dispersion force the investigation intermolecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which point out the existence and action forces molecular these observations include ideal gas thermodynamic behavior reflected virial coefficients vapor pressure viscosity superficial tension and adsorption the first reference the nature microscopic forces found alexis clairaut work theorie figure other scientists who have contributed the investigation microscopic forces laplace gauss maxwell and boltzmann attractive intermolecular forces are considered the following dipole dipole forces dipole forces van der waals forces keesom force debye force and london dispersion force information intermolecular force obtained macroscopic measurements properties like pvt the link microscopic aspects given virial coefficients and lennard jones potentials contents dipole dipole interactions ion dipole and induced dipole forces hydrogen bonding van der waals forces keesom permanent force debye induced force london dispersion force relative strength forces quantum mechanical theories see also references external links dipole interactions dipole dipole interactions are electrostatic interactions between permanent dipoles these interactions tend align the molecules increase attraction reducing potential energy example dipole interaction can seen hydrogen chloride the positive end polar molecule will attract the negative end the other molecule and influence its polar molecules have net attraction between examples polar molecules include hydrogen chloride and chloroform chcl often molecules contain dipolar but have overall dipole moment this occurs there symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles cancel each other this occurs molecules such tetrachloromethane note that the dipole interaction between two individual atoms usually since atoms rarely carry permanent see atomic dipoles ion dipole and induced dipole forces ion dipole and induced dipole forces are similar dipole and dipole interactions but involve instead only polar and polar ion dipole and induced dipole forces are stronger than dipole interactions because the charge any ion much greater than the charge dipole ion dipole bonding stronger than hydrogen citation needed dipole force consists ion and polar molecule they align that the positive and negative groups are next one allowing for maximum induced dipole force consists ion and polar molecule like induced dipole the charge the ion causes distortion the electron cloud the polar hydrogen bonding hydrogen bond hydrogen bond the attraction between the lone pair electronegative atom and hydrogen atom that bonded either nitrogen oxygen fluorine the hydrogen bond often described strong electrostatic dipole however also has some features covalent stronger than van der waals interaction produces interatomic distances shorter than the sum van der waals radius and usually involves limited number interaction which can interpreted kind valence intermolecular hydrogen bonding responsible for the high boiling point water compared the other group hydrides which have hydrogen intramolecular hydrogen bonding partly responsible for the secondary tertiary and quaternary structures proteins and nucleic acids also plays important role the structure polymers both synthetic and citation needed van der waals forces van der waals force keesom permanent force keesom interactions named after willem hendrik keesom are attractive interactions dipoles that are ensemble averaged over different rotational orientations the assumed that the molecules are constantly rotating and never get locked into this good but some point molecules get locked into the energy keesom interaction depends the inverse sixth power the unlike the interaction energy two spatially fixed which depends the inverse third power the the keesom interaction can only occur among molecules that possess permanent dipole moments aka two polar also keesom interactions are very weak van der waals interactions and not occur aqueous solutions that contain the angle averaged interaction given the following where charge per permitivity free dielectric constant surrounding temperature boltzmann and distance between debye induced force the induced dipole forces appear from the induction also known polarization which the attractive interaction between permanent multipole one molecule with induced the former multipole this interaction called the debye force named after peter debye one example interaction between permanent dipole and induced dipole the interaction between hcl and this experiences dipole its electrons are attracted the side repelled from the the angle averaged interaction given the following where polarizability this kind interaction can expected between any polar molecule and symmetrical the interaction force far weaker than dipole but stronger than the london dispersion force london dispersion force london dispersion force otherwise known induced instantaneous polarization instantaneous induced dipole the london dispersion force caused correlated movements the electrons interacting electrons that belong different molecules start fleeing and avoiding each other the short intermolecular which frequently described formation instantaneous that attract each relative strength forces hydrogen bonds citation needed note this comparison only approximate the actual relative strengths will vary depending the molecules ionic and covalent bonding will always stronger than intermolecular forces any given quantum mechanical theories quantum mechanical explanation intermolecular interactions this section requires expansion september intermolecular forces observed between atoms and molecules can described phenomenologically occurring between permanent and instantaneous outlined alternatively one may seek unifying theory that able explain the various types interactions such hydrogen van der waals forces and dipole typically this done applying the ideas quantum mechanics and dinger perturbation theory has been especially effective this when applied existing quantum chemistry methods such quantum mechanical explanation intermolecular interactions this provides array approximate methods that can used analyze
