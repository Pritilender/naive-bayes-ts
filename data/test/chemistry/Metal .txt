opaque shiny and features good electrical and thermal conductivity metals are generally malleable that they can hammered pressed permanently out shape without breaking cracking well fusible able fused and ductile able drawn out into thin about the elements the periodic table are metals some elements appear both metallic and metallic the meaning metal differs for various for astronomers use the blanket term metal for convenience collectively describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium the main components stars which turn comprise most the visible matter the thus astronomy and physical cosmology the metallicity object the proportion its matter made chemical elements other than hydrogen and many elements and compounds that are not normally classified metals become metallic

metal extraction recycling metals metallurgy applications trade history see also references external links structure and bonding the atoms metallic substances are closely positioned neighboring atoms one two common the first arrangement known body centered cubic this each atom positioned the center eight the other known face centered cubic this each atom positioned the center six the ongoing arrangement atoms these structures forms crystal some metals adopt both structures depending the atoms metals readily lose their outer shell resulting free flowing cloud electrons within their otherwise solid this provides the ability metallic substances easily transmit heat and while this flow electrons the solid characteristic the metal produced electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron this type bond called metallic bond properties chemical metals are usually inclined form cations through electron reacting with oxygen the air form oxides over various timescales iron rusts over while potassium burns examples the transition metals such iron copper zinc and nickel are slower oxidize because they form passivating layer oxide that protects the others like palladium platinum and gold not react with the atmosphere some metals form barrier layer oxide their surface which cannot penetrated further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades like aluminium magnesium some steels and titanium the oxides metals are generally basic opposed those nonmetals which are acidic blatant exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such cro and oso which have strictly acidic painting anodizing plating metals are good ways prevent their corrosion however more reactive metal the electrochemical series must chosen for especially when chipping the coating water and the two metals form electrochemical cell and the coating less reactive than the the coating actually promotes corrosion physical gallium metals general have high electrical conductivity high thermal conductivity and high density typically they are malleable and deforming under stress without cleaving terms optical metals are shiny and lustrous sheets metal beyond few micrometres thickness appear but gold leaf transmits green although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals there wide variation their lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the the alkali and alkaline earth metals groups and are referred the light metals because they have low low and low melting the high density most metals due the tightly packed crystal lattice the metallic the strength metallic bonds for different metals reaches maximum around the center the transition metal series those elements have large amounts delocalized electrons tight binding type metallic however other factors such atomic radius nuclear charge number bonds orbitals overlap orbital energies and crystal form are involved electrical density states equilibrium semimetals fermi level insulators semiconductors band gap thermally populated holes the electrical and thermal conductivities metals originate from the fact that their outer electrons are delocalized this situation can visualized seeing the atomic structure metal collection atoms embedded sea highly mobile the electrical well the contribution the heat capacity and heat conductivity metals can calculated from the free electron model which does not take into account the detailed structure the ion when considering the electronic band structure

properties metals include ductility their capacity for plastic deformation reversible elastic deformation metals can described hooke law for restoring where the stress linearly proportional the strain forces larger than the elastic limit may cause permanent deformation the known plastic deformation plasticity this irreversible change atomic arrangement may occur result the action applied force work applied force may tensile force compressive force shear bending torsion forces change temperature temperature change may affect the mobility the structural defects such grain boundaries point line and screw dislocations stacking faults and twins both crystalline and non crystalline solids the movement displacement such mobile defects thermally activated and thus limited the rate atomic diffusion blacksmith viscous flow near grain for can give rise internal slip creep and fatigue can also contribute significant changes the microstructure like grain growth and localized densification due the elimination intergranular porosity screw dislocations may slip the direction any lattice plane containing the while the principal driving force for dislocation the movement diffusion vacancies through crystal lattice the nondirectional nature metallic bonding also thought contribute significantly the ductility most metallic when the planes ionic bond slide past one the resultant change location shifts ions the same charge into close resulting the cleavage the such shift not observed covalently bonded crystals where fracture and crystal fragmentation alloys alloy alloy mixture two more elements which the main component most pure metals are either too brittle chemically reactive for practical combining different ratios metals alloys modifies the properties pure metals produce desirable the aim making alloys generally make them less harder resistant have more desirable color and all the metallic alloys use the alloys iron steel stainless steel cast iron tool steel alloy steel make the largest proportion both quantity and commercial iron alloyed with various proportions carbon gives mid and high carbon with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and the addition silicon will produce cast while the addition chromium nickel and molybdenum carbon steels more than results stainless other significant metallic alloys are those aluminium titanium copper and magnesium copper alloys have been known since bronze gave the bronze age its and have many applications most importantly electrical the alloys the other three metals have been developed relatively due their chemical reactivity they require electrolytic extraction the alloys titanium and magnesium are valued for their high weight magnesium can also provide electromagnetic shielding citation needed these materials are ideal for situations where high weight ratio more important than material such aerospace and some automotive alloys specially designed for highly demanding such jet engines may contain more than ten categories base metal base metal chemistry the term base metal used informally refer metal that oxidizes corrodes relatively and reacts variably with dilute hydrochloric acid form hydrogen examples include nickel lead and copper considered base metal oxidizes relatively although does not react with commonly used opposition noble metal alchemy base metal was common and inexpensive opposed precious metals mainly gold and longtime goal the alchemists was the transmutation base metals into precious numismatics coins the past derived their value primarily from the precious metal content most modern currencies are fiat currency allowing the coins made base metal ferrous metal ferrous and ferrous metals the term ferrous derived from the latin word meaning containing this can include pure such wrought iron alloy such steel ferrous metals are often magnetic but not noble metal noble metal noble metals are metals that are resistant corrosion oxidation unlike most base metals they tend precious often due perceived examples include platinum silver and rhodium precious metal precious metal precious metal rare metallic chemical element high economic chemically the precious metals are less reactive than most have high luster and high electrical historically precious metals were important currency but are now regarded mainly investment and industrial commodities gold silver platinum and palladium each have iso currency the known precious metals are gold and while both have industrial they are better known for their uses art jewelry and coinage other precious metals include the platinum group metals ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium iridium and which platinum the most widely the demand for precious metals driven not only their practical but also their role investments and store value palladium summer valued little under half the price and platinum around twice that silver substantially less expensive than these but often traditionally considered precious metal for its role coinage and extraction ore mining extractive metallurgy metals are often extracted from the earth means resulting ores that are relatively rich sources the requisite ore located prospecting techniques followed the exploration and examination mineral sources are generally divided into surface mines which are mined excavation using heavy and subsurface mines once the ore the metals must extracted usually chemical electrolytic pyrometallurgy uses high temperatures convert ore into raw while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry for the same the methods used depend the metal and their when metal ore ionic compound that metal and the ore must usually smelted heated with reducing agent extract the pure many common such are smelted using carbon reducing some such aluminium and sodium have commercially practical reducing and are extracted using electrolysis instead sulfide ores are not reduced directly the metal but are roasted air convert them recycling metals demand for metals closely linked economic during the the variety metals uses society grew today the development major such china and and advances are fuelling ever more the result that mining activities are and more and more the metal stocks are above ground rather than below ground unused example the use stock between and copper use the usa rose from per metals are inherently can used over and over minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy the same for the energy used make aluminium from bauxite ore saved using recycled however levels metals recycling are generally the international resource panel hosted the united nations environment programme published reports metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling the report authors observed that the metal stocks society can serve huge mines above however they warned that the recycling rates some rare metals used applications such mobile battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are low that unless future life recycling rates are dramatically stepped these critical metals will become unavailable for use modern metallurgy metallurgy metallurgy domain materials science that studies the physical and chemical behavior metallic their intermetallic and their which are called applications some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit making them useful materials for carrying large loads resisting impact metal alloys can engineered have high resistance torque and however the same metal can also vulnerable fatigue damage through repeated use from sudden stress failure when load capacity the strength and resilience metals has led their frequent use rise building and bridge well most many tools pipes non illuminated signs and railroad the two most commonly used structural iron and are also the most abundant metals the earth crust metals are good making them valuable electrical appliances and for carrying electric current over distance with little energy electrical power grids rely metal cables distribute home electrical for the most are wired with copper wire for its good conducting the thermal conductivity metal useful for containers heat materials over metal also used for heat sinks protect sensitive equipment from the high reflectivity some metals important the construction including precision astronomical this last property can also make metallic jewelry aesthetically some metals have specialized radioactive metals such uranium and plutonium are used nuclear power plants produce energy via nuclear fission mercury liquid room temperature and used switches complete circuit when flows over the switch shape memory alloy used for applications such fasteners and vascular stents trade ore the world bank reports that china was the top importer ores and metals followed the united states and history the nature metals has fascinated mankind for many because these materials provided people with tools unsurpassed properties both war and their preparation and sterling gold and silver were known man since the stone age lead and silver were fused from their ores early the fourth ancient latin and greek writers such theophrastus pliny the elder his natural history pedanius dioscorides did not try classify the ancients never attained the concept metal distinct elementary substance characteristic chemical and physical following empedocles all substances within the sublunary sphere were assumed vary their constituent classical elements water air and following the pythagoreans plato assumed that these elements could further reduced plane geometrical shapes triangles and bounding space and relating the regular polyhedra the sequence water air fire however this philosophical extension did not become popular the simple four after was rejected aristotle aristotle also rejected the atomic theory democritus since classified the implied existence vacuum necessary for motion contradiction vacuum implies therefore cannot aristotle however introduce underlying antagonistic qualities dry wet and cold heat into the composition each the four the word metal originally meant mines and only later gained the general meaning products from materials obtained the first centuries relation between the planets and the existing metals was assumed silver electrum iron copper tin lead saturn after electrum was determined combination silver and the relations jupiter and mercury were substituted into the previous arabic and medieval alchemists believed that all and all sublunar were composed the principle carrying the combustible and the principle the mother all metals and carrier the liquidity and the volatility these principles were not necessarily the common substances sulfur and mercury found most this theory reinforced the belief that the all metals were destined become gold the bowels the earth through the proper combinations digestion time and elimination all which could developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods paracelsus added the third principle carrying the nonvolatile and incombustible his tria prima doctrine these theories retained the four classical elements underlying the composition mercury and the first systematic text the arts mining and metallurgy was pirotechnia vannoccio biringuccio which treats the fusion and working sixteen years georgius agricola published metallica clear and complete account the profession metallurgy and the accessory arts and well qualifying the greatest treatise the chemical industry through the sixteenth gave the following description metal his natura fossilium metal mineral nature either liquid somewhat the latter may melted the heat the but when has cooled down again and lost all becomes hard again and resumes its proper this respect differs from the stone which melts the for although the latter regain its yet loses its pristine form and traditionally there are six different kinds namely silver copper iron tin and there are really for quicksilver although the alchemists disagree with this and bismuth the ancient greek writers seem have been ignorant wherefore ammonius rightly states that there are many species animals and plants which are unknown stibium when smelted the crucible and refined has much right regarded proper metal accorded lead when certain portion added alloy produced from which the type made that used those who print books each metal has its own form which preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with therefore neither electrum nor stannum not meaning our itself real but rather alloy two electrum alloy gold and stannum lead and and yet silver parted from the then gold remains and not silver taken away from then lead remains and not whether
