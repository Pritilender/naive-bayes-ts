chemistry	molar concentration navigation search molality the molar concentration defined the amount constituent usually measured moles hence the divided the volume the mixture also called molarity amount substance concentration amount concentration substance concentration simply concentration the volume the definition refers the volume the not the volume the one litre solution usually contains either slightly more slightly less than liter solvent because the process dissolution causes volume liquid increase the reciprocal quantity represents the dilution which can appear law dilution contents notation units related quantities number concentration mass concentration mole fraction mass fraction molality properties sum molar concentrations normalizing relation sum products molar partial molar volumes dependence volume spatial variation and diffusion examples references external links notation addition the notation there notation using brackets and the formula compound like this notation encountered especially equilibrium constants and reaction quotients units the unit however more commonly the unit solution concentration also denoted prefix often used denote commonly used units are listed the table related quantities number concentration number concentration the conversion number concentration given where the avogadro constant approximately mol mass concentration mass concentration the conversion mass concentration given where the molar mass constituent mole fraction mole fraction the conversion mole fraction given where the average molar mass the the density the solution and the index other simpler relation can obtained considering the total molar concentration namely the sum molar concentrations all the components the mass fraction mass fraction the conversion mass fraction given molality molality the conversion molality for binary where the solute assigned the subscript for solutions with more than one the conversion properties sum molar concentrations normalizing relation the sum molar concentrations gives the total molar namely the density the mixture divided the molar mass the mixture another name the reciprocal the molar volume the ionic solution ionic strength proportional the sum molar concentration sum products molar partial molar volumes the sum products between these quantities equals dependence volume molar concentration depends the variation the volume the solution due mainly thermal small intervals temperature the dependence where the molar concentration reference the thermal expansion coefficient the spatial variation and diffusion molar and mass concentration have different values space where diffusion examples example consider nacl dissolved the final mass concentration will the density such solution thus its volume will the molar concentration nacl the solution here mol the molar mass example another typical task chemistry the preparation solution nacl the mass salt needed create the nacl are placed volumetric flask dissolved some then followed the addition more water until the total volume reaches example the density water approximately and its molar mass mol therefore the molar concentration water likewise the concentration solid hydrogen molar mass the concentration pure osmium tetroxide molar mass example typical protein bacteria such coli may have about copies and the volume bacterium about thus the number concentration the molar concentration reference ranges for blood tests the concentration refers original chemical formula the molar concentration sometimes called formal concentration for sodium carbonate solution has formal concentration the molar concentrations are and because the salt dissociates into these
