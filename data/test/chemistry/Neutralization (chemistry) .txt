chemistry	neutralization navigation search sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid neutralization neutralisation see spelling differences chemical reaction which acid and base react form salt water but not produced neutralizations with arrhenius acids and bases always produce water where alkali reactions produce water and metal salt often neutralization reactions are exothermic the enthalpy neutralization for the reaction sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid however forms endothermic neutralization such the reaction between sodium bicarbonate baking and acetic acid neutralization reactions not necessarily imply resultant the resultant will vary based the respective strengths the acid and base contents arrhenius acids and bases background net ionic equation general neutralization equation acid alkali non aqueous reactions resultant calculations applications references further reading arrhenius acids and bases background svante arrhenius defined acid substances that produces hydrogen ions protons aqueous solutions hydrochloric acid hcl and sulfuric acid are common examples arrhenius acids when they dissociate into their they increase the amount the hcl hso arrhenius defined base substance that produces hydroxide aqueous arrhenius definition base was limited because along with produced hydroxide ions the base must contain the hydroxide group its potassium hydroxide and caesium hydroxide are common examples arrhenius bases when they dissociate into their they increase the amount the koh csoh net ionic equation when acid reacts with equal amount the word neutralization used describe the result because the acid and base properties and are destroyed the and combine form hoh more commonly written the water molecule thus acid base neutralization reactions can simplified the net ionic important realize that this representation somewhat known that the hydrogen ion does not actually occur but instead the hydronium ion seen the following the cause molecules water undergo protonation form the hydronium considering the hydronium the actual net ionic reaction occurring general neutralization equation neutralization reaction type double replacement reaction typically the resulting solution produced the reaction consists salt and the general formula for base neutralization reactions can written where represents the arrhenius boh represents the arrhenius and the salt notice typical double replacement the cations and anions the substances merely switch example reaction this form the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide water and sodium chloride common table salt are the following are other examples base neutralization reactions sulfuric acid reacting with ammonium hydroxide produce ammonium sulfate and water carbonic acid reacting with sodium hydroxide produce sodium carbonate and water hydrochloric acid reacting with aluminium hydroxide produce aluminium chloride and water alkali alkali reaction neutralization reaction which considered special case base where the base used also alkali alkali base that contains metal from group the alkali metals lithium sodium potassium rubidium caesium from group the alkaline earth metals beryllium magnesium calcium strontium barium when acid reacts with alkali forms metal salt and alkalis may defined soluble bases which means they must able dissolve therefore one may also speak hydroxide bases that dissolve and thus these would also some then alkalis would sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide note that only hydroxides with alkali metal column are very soluble hydroxides with alkaline earth metal column are not some sources will even say the alkaline earth metal hydroxides are however alkalis may also have broader definition that includes carbonates bonded group metal ammonium ion amine radical the positive examples alkalis would then also include and non aqueous reactions aqueous water less likely however there always donation protons see lowry base theory since variety definitions acids and bases variety reactions may considered neutralization all the following may considered neutralization reactions under different resultant neutralization reactions not necessarily imply resultant the case that strong acid and strong base participate neutralization the resultant will for the strong hcl and the strong naoh react give water and nacl since there net change the concentrations either the end weak acid and strong base participate neutralization the resultant will greater than for the weak and the strong naoh react give and coo behaves spectator however acetate weak base that hydrolyzes water give ions thus the resultant solution weak base and strong acid participate neutralization the resultant will less than for the weak and the strong hcl react give and hydrocyanic hcn behaves spectator however hydrocyanic acid weak acid that hydrolyzes water give ions thus the resultant solution finally weak acid and weak base participate neutralization the resultant will depend the relative strength the acid and base for the weak and the weak react give hcn and coo because cooh stronger acid than hcn the equilibrium driven the assuming equimolar initial concentrations the weak acid and weak the acetate ions further react with water give acetic acid and this particular the resultant solution however this not general rule for all neutralization reactions between weak acid and weak calculations equal numbers moles acid and base are needed for neutralization hence the formula becomes where the number acidic hydrogens and the constant that shows how many ions the base can denotes the concentration acid and the concentration the volume acid and the volume applications chemical titration methods are used for analyzing acids bases determine the unknown concentration either meter indicator which shows the point neutralization distinct color change can simple stoichiometric calculations with the known volume the unknown and the known volume and molarity the added chemical gives the molarity the wastewater treatment chemical neutralization methods are often applied reduce the damage that effluent may cause upon release the for popular chemicals include calcium carbonate calcium oxide magnesium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate the selection appropriate neutralization chemical depends the particular there are many uses neutralization reactions that are alkali very common use antacid these are designed neutralize excess gastric acid the stomach hcl that may causing discomfort the stomach lower this can also remedied the ingestion sodium bicarbonate nahco also the digestive neutralization reactions are used when food moved from the stomach the order for the nutrients absorbed through the intestinal alkaline environment the pancreas produce antacid bicarbonate cause this transformation another common though perhaps not widely fertilizers and control soil slaked lime calcium limestone calcium may worked into soil that too acidic for plant fertilizers that improve plant growth are made neutralizing sulfuric acid nitric acid hno with ammonia gas making ammonium sulfate ammonium nitrate these are salts utilized the industrially product the burning sulfur dioxide gas may combine with water vapor the air eventually produce sulfuric which falls acid prevent the sulfur dioxide from being device known scrubber gleans the gas from smoke this device first blows calcium carbonate into the combustion chamber where decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon this lime then reacts with the sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium suspension lime then injected into the mixture produce which removes the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur
