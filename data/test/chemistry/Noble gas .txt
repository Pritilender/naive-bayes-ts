possible that due relativistic effects the group element flerovium exhibits some like instead the group element ununoctium noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme the inertness noble gases makes them very suitable applications where reactions are not for argon used lightbulbs prevent the hot tungsten filament from also helium breathed sea divers prevent oxygen and nitrogen the properties the noble gases can well explained modern theories atomic structure their outer shell valence electrons considered full giving them little tendency participate chemical and has been possible prepare only few hundred noble gas compounds the melting and boiling points for given noble gas are close differing less than that they are liquids over only small temperature neon argon krypton and xenon are obtained from air air separation unit using the methods liquefaction gases and fractional distillation helium sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations helium the natural gas using cryogenic gas separation techniques and radon usually isolated from the radioactive decay dissolved radium compounds noble gases have several important

physical and atomic properties chemical properties noble gas notation compounds occurrence and production applications discharge color see also notes references history noble gas translated from the german noun edelgas first used hugo erdmann indicate their extremely low level the name makes analogy the term noble metals which also have low the noble gases have also been referred inert gases but this label deprecated many noble gas compounds are now rare gases another term that was but this also inaccurate because argon forms fairly considerable part the earth atmosphere spectral lines pierre janssen and joseph norman lockyer discovered new element august while looking the chromosphere the sun and named helium after the greek word for the lios helios chemical analysis was possible the but helium was later found noble before the english chemist and physicist henry cavendish had discovered that air contains small proportion substance less reactive than nitrogen century lord rayleigh discovered that samples nitrogen from the air were different density than nitrogen resulting from chemical reactions along with scottish scientist william ramsay university london lord rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another leading experiment that successfully isolated new argon from the greek word arg inactive with this they realized entire class gases was missing from the periodic during his search for ramsay also managed isolate helium for the first time while heating cleveite having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and dmitri mendeleev included these noble gases his arrangement the which would later become the periodic ramsay continued search for these gases using the method fractional distillation separate liquid air into several discovered the elements krypton neon and xenon and named them after the greek words krypt hidden new and nos stranger respectively radon was first identified friedrich ernst dorn and was named radium emanation but was not considered noble gas until when its characteristics were found similar those other noble rayleigh and ramsay received the nobel prizes physics and respectively for their discovery the noble the words cederblom then president the royal swedish academy sciences the discovery entirely new group which single representative had been known with any something utterly unique the history being intrinsically advance science peculiar the discovery the noble gases aided the development general understanding atomic structure french chemist henri moissan attempted form reaction between fluorine the most electronegative element and one the noble but scientists were unable prepare compounds argon until the end the but these attempts helped develop new theories atomic learning from these danish physicist niels bohr proposed that the electrons atoms are arranged shells surrounding the nucleus and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight gilbert lewis formulated the octet rule which concluded octet electrons the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any this arrangement caused them unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons complete their outer neil bartlett discovered the first chemical compound noble xenon hexafluoroplatinate compounds other noble gases were discovered soon for radon difluoride and for krypton difluoride krf the first stable compound argon was reported when argon fluorohydride was formed temperature december scientists the joint institute for nuclear research working dubna russia bombarded plutonium with calcium produce single atom flerovium preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element may the first superheavy element show abnormal like even though member group the periodic october scientists from the joint institute for nuclear research and lawrence livermore national laboratory successfully created synthetically ununoctium the seventh element bombarding californium with calcium physical and atomic properties helium neon argon krypton xenon radon density boiling point melting point enthalpy vaporization solubility atomic number atomic radius ionization energy allen electronegativity for more see noble gas data the noble gases have weak interatomic force and consequently have very low melting and boiling points they are all monatomic gases under standard conditions including the elements with larger atomic masses than many normally solid helium has several unique qualities when compared with other its boiling and melting points are lower than those any other known the only element known exhibit superfluidity the only element that cannot solidified cooling under standard pressure standard atmospheres kpa psi must applied temperature convert the noble gases xenon have multiple stable isotopes radon has stable isotopes its lived has half life days and decays form helium and polonium which ultimately decays lead ionization potential the noble gas like atoms most increase steadily atomic radius from one period the next due the increasing number the size the atom related several for the ionization potential decreases with increasing radius because the valence electrons the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held tightly together the noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements each which reflects the stability their electron configuration and related their relative lack chemical some the heavier noble however have ionization potentials small enough comparable those other elements and molecules was the insight that xenon has ionization potential similar that the oxygen molecule that led bartlett attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride oxidizing agent known strong enough react with noble gases cannot accept electron form stable anions that they have negative electron affinity the macroscopic physical properties the noble gases are dominated the weak van der waals forces between the the attractive force increases with the size the atom result the increase polarizability and the decrease ionization this results systematic group one goes down the atomic and with the interatomic increases resulting increasing melting boiling enthalpy vaporization and solubility the increase density due the increase atomic mass the noble gases are nearly ideal gases under standard but their deviations from the ideal gas law provided important clues for the study intermolecular interactions the lennard jones potential often used model intermolecular was deduced john jones from experimental data argon before the development quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles the theoretical analysis these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms which means that the interaction between the atoms independent isotropic chemical properties valence shell the noble gases are odorless tasteless and nonflammable under standard they were once labeled group the periodic table because was believed they had valence meaning their atoms cannot combine with those other elements form compounds however was later discovered some indeed form causing this label fall into like other the members this family show patterns its electron configuration especially the outermost shells resulting trends chemical element shell helium neon argon krypton xenon radon the noble gases have full valence electron shells valence electrons are the outermost electrons atom and are normally the only electrons that participate chemical bonding atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore not tend form chemical bonds and have little tendency gain lose however heavier noble gases such radon are held less firmly together electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such making easier remove outer electrons from heavy noble noble gas notation result full the noble gases can used conjunction with the electron configuration notation form the noble gas notation the nearest noble gas that precedes the element question written and then the electron configuration continued from that point for the electron notation carbon and the noble gas notation this notation makes easier identify and shorter than writing out the full notation atomic orbitals compounds noble gas compound xef the noble gases show extremely low chemical reactivity consequently only few hundred noble gas compounds have been neutral compounds which helium and neon are involved chemical bonds have not been formed although there some theoretical evidence for few helium while krypton and argon have shown only minor the reactivity follows the order linus pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and predicted the existence krypton hexafluoride krf and xenon hexafluoride xef speculated that xef might exist unstable and suggested xenic acid could form perxenate salts these predictions were shown generally except that xef now thought both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable xenon compounds are the most numerous the noble gas compounds that have been most them have the xenon atom the oxidation state bonded highly electronegative atoms such fluorine xenon difluoride xef xenon tetrafluoride xef xenon hexafluoride xef xenon tetroxide xeo and sodium perxenate xeo xenon reacts with fluorine form numerous xenon fluorides according the following some these compounds have found use chemical synthesis oxidizing agents xef commercially available and can used fluorinating agent about five hundred compounds xenon bonded other elements have been including organoxenon compounds containing xenon bonded and xenon bonded chlorine gold mercury and xenon compounds xenon bound hydrogen bromine iodine beryllium sulphur titanium copper and silver have also been observed but only low temperatures noble gas matrices supersonic noble gas radon more reactive than and therefore should form chemical bonds more easily than xenon however due the high radioactivity and short life radon isotopes only few fluorides and oxides radon have been formed krypton less reactive than but several compounds have been reported with krypton the oxidation state krypton difluoride the most notable and easily under extreme krypton reacts with fluorine form krf according the following compounds which krypton forms single bond nitrogen and oxygen have also been but are only stable below and respectively krypton atoms chemically bound other nonmetals chlorine carbon well some late transition metals silver gold have also been but only either low temperatures noble gas supersonic noble gas similar conditions were used obtain the first few compounds argon such argon fluorohydride and some bound the late transition metals silver and stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium neon are the noble including can form stable molecular ions the gas the simplest the helium hydride molecular ion heh discovered because composed the two most abundant elements the hydrogen and believed occur naturally the interstellar medium although has not been detected addition these there are many known neutral excimers the noble these are compounds such arf and krf that are stable only when excited electronic state some them find application excimer lasers addition the compounds where noble gas atom involved covalent bond noble gases also form non covalent compounds the clathrates first described consist noble gas atom trapped within cavities crystal lattices certain organic and inorganic the essential condition for their formation that the guest noble atoms must appropriate size fit the cavities the host crystal for argon krypton and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone but helium and neon not because they are too small insufficiently polarizable neon argon krypton and xenon also form clathrate where the noble gas trapped noble gases can form endohedral fullerene compounds which the noble gas atom trapped inside fullerene molecule was discovered that when spherical molecule consisting carbon exposed noble gases high complexes such can formed the notation indicates contained inside but not covalently bound endohedral complexes with neon argon krypton and xenon have been these compounds have found use the study the structure and reactivity fullerenes means the nuclear magnetic resonance the noble gas xef noble gas compounds such xenon difluoride xef are considered hypervalent because they violate the octet rule bonding such compounds can explained using three center electron bond model this first proposed considers bonding three collinear for bonding xef described set three molecular orbitals derived from orbitals each bonding results from the combination filled orbital from with one filled orbital from each atom resulting filled bonding filled bonding and empty antibonding orbital the highest occupied molecular orbital localized the two terminal this represents localization charge which facilitated the high electronegativity the chemistry heavier noble krypton and are well the chemistry the lighter argon and still early while neon compound still yet occurrence and production the abundances the noble gases the universe decrease their atomic numbers increase helium the most common element the universe after with mass fraction about most the helium the universe was formed during big bang nucleosynthesis but the amount helium steadily increasing due the fusion hydrogen stellar nucleosynthesis very slight the alpha decay heavy abundances earth follow different for helium only the third most abundant noble gas the the reason that there primordial helium the due the small mass the helium cannot retained the gravitational field helium earth comes from the alpha decay heavy elements such uranium and thorium found the crust and tends accumulate natural gas deposits the abundance the other increased result the beta decay potassium also found the form argon which the most abundant isotope argon earth despite being relatively rare the solar system this process the base for the potassium argon dating method xenon has unexpectedly low abundance the what has been called the missing xenon problem one theory that the missing xenon may trapped minerals inside the after the discovery xenon dioxide research showed that can substitute for the quartz radon formed the lithosphere from the alpha decay can seep into buildings through cracks their foundation and accumulate areas that are not well due its high radon presents significant health implicated estimated lung cancer deaths per year the united states ppm usd for scale helium extracted fractional distillation from natural which can contain helium neon argon krypton and xenon are obtained from air using the methods liquefaction gases convert elements liquid and fractional distillation separate mixtures into component helium typically produced separating from natural gas and radon isolated from the radioactive decay radium the prices the noble gases are influenced their natural with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most the table the right lists the prices the united states for laboratory quantities each applications noble gases have very low boiling and melting which makes them useful cryogenic refrigerants liquid helium which boils used for superconducting magnets such those needed nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance liquid although does not reach temperatures low liquid also finds use cryogenics because has over times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid helium used component breathing gases replace due its low solubility especially lipids gases are absorbed the blood and body tissues when under pressure like scuba diving which causes anesthetic effect known nitrogen narcosis due its reduced little helium taken into cell membranes and when helium used replace part the breathing such trimix heliox decrease the narcotic effect the gas depth helium reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known decompression sickness the bends the reduced amount dissolved gas the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease pressure the another noble argon considered the best option for use drysuit inflation gas for scuba helium also used filling gas nuclear fuel rods for nuclear since the hindenburg disaster helium has replaced hydrogen lifting gas blimps and balloons due its lightness and despite decrease many the noble gases are used provide inert argon used the synthesis air sensitive compounds that are sensitive solid argon also used for the study very unstable such reactive intermediates trapping them inert matrix very low helium used the carrier medium gas chromatography filler gas for and devices for measuring such the geiger counter and the bubble chamber helium and argon are both commonly used shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and well other metallurgical processes and the production silicon for the semiconductor xenon arc lamp imax noble gases are commonly used lighting because their lack chemical argon mixed with used filler gas for incandescent light bulbs krypton used performance light which have higher color temperatures and greater because reduces the rate evaporation the filament more than halogen lamps use krypton mixed with small amounts compounds iodine bromine the noble gases glow distinctive colors when used inside gas discharge lamps such neon lights these lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and phosphors which add various hues the red color xenon commonly used xenon arc lamps which due their nearly continuous spectrum that resembles find application film projectors and automobile the noble gases are used excimer lasers which are based lived electronically excited molecules known excimers the excimers used for lasers may noble gas dimers such more the noble gas combined with halogen excimers such krf xef these lasers produce ultraviolet light due its short wavelength for arf and for allows for precision excimer lasers have many medical and scientific they are used for microlithography and microfabrication which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture and for laser surgery including laser angioplasty and eye surgery some noble gases have direct application helium sometimes used improve the ease breathing asthma sufferers xenon used anesthetic because its high solubility which makes more potent than the usual nitrous oxide and because readily eliminated from the resulting faster xenon finds application medical imaging the lungs through hyperpolarized
