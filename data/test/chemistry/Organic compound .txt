chemistry	organic compound navigation search methane organic compound any member large class gaseous liquid solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon for historical reasons discussed few types containing compounds such carbides carbonates simple oxides carbon such and and cyanides are considered inorganic the distinction between organic and inorganic carbon while useful organizing the vast subject somewhat organic chemistry the science concerned with all aspects organic organic synthesis the methodology their contents history vitalism modern classification classification natural compounds synthetic compounds biotechnology nomenclature databases structure determination see also references external links history vitalism vitalism the word organic dating the for many western alchemists believed vitalism this the theory that certain compounds could synthesized only from their classical elements water air and the action vis vitalis that only organisms vitalism taught that these organic compounds were fundamentally different from the inorganic compounds that could obtained from the elements chemical vitalism survived for while even after the rise modern atomic theory and the replacement the aristotelian elements those know first came under question when friedrich hler synthesized oxalic acid compound known occur only living from cyanogen citation needed more decisive experiment was synthesis urea from the inorganic salts potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate urea had long been considered organic compound was known occur only the urine living experiments were followed many where increasingly complex organic substances were produced from inorganic ones without the involvement any living citation needed modern classification even though vitalism has been scientific nomenclature retains the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds the modern meaning organic compound any compound that contains significant amount even though many the organic compounds known today have connection any substance found living there single official definition organic some textbooks define organic compound one that contains one more others include bonds the others state that molecule contains even the broader definition containing requires the exclusion containing alloys including steel relatively small number containing compounds such metal carbonates and carbonyls simple oxides carbon and cyanides well the allotropes carbon and simple carbon halides and which are usually considered inorganic the definition excludes compounds that are historically and practically considered neither urea nor oxalic acid organic this yet they were two key compounds the vitalism the iupac blue book organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea and oxalic other compounds lacking bonds that are also traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid and carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid which contains considered possible organic substance martian soil bond found most organic except some small molecules like methane and which have only one carbon atom their the rule also leads somewhat arbitrary divisions sets fluorine for teflon considered this rule inorganic but tefzel organic likewise many halons are considered whereas the rest are considered for these and other most sources believe compounds are only subset organic compounds most containing compounds are and almost all organic compounds contain least bond compound does not need contain bonds considered organic urea but many organic compounds classification organic chemistry classification organic compounds organic compounds may classified variety one major distinction between natural and synthetic organic compounds can also classified subdivided the presence heteroatoms organometallic compounds which feature bonds between carbon and metal and organophosphorus compounds which feature bonds between carbon and phosphorus another based upon the size organic distinguishes between small molecules and polymers natural compounds natural compounds refer those that are produced plants many these are still extracted from natural sources because they would more expensive produce examples include most sugars some alkaloids and terpenoids certain nutrients such vitamin and those natural products with large stereoisometrically complicated molecules present reasonable concentrations living further compounds prime importance biochemistry are antigens carbohydrates enzymes hormones lipids and fatty acids neurotransmitters nucleic acids proteins peptides and amino acids lectins vitamins and fats and oils synthetic compounds compounds that are prepared reaction other compounds are referred synthetic they may either compounds that already are found plants animals those that not occur most polymers category that includes all plastics and rubbers are organic synthetic synthetic biotechnology several compounds are industrially manufactured utilizing the biochemistry organisms such bacteria and two examples are ethanol and insulin regularly the dna the organism altered express desired often not ordinarily produced that sometimes the biotechnologically engineered compounds were never present nature the first nomenclature this section requires expansion april the iupac nomenclature organic compounds slightly differs from the cas nomenclature databases the cas database the most comprehensive repository for data organic the search tool scifinder the beilstein database contains information million covers the scientific literature from the and today accessible via reaxys structures and large diversity physical and chemical properties available for each with reference original pubchem contains million entries compounds and especially covers the field medicinal chemistry there great number more specialized databases for diverse branches organic structure determination see structure determination the main tools are proton and carbon nmr spectroscopy and ray crystallography see also inorganic compounds list chemical compounds list organic compounds organometallic compounds
