oxide navigation search silicon dioxide oxide chemical compound that contains least one oxygen atom and one other element its chemical formula metal oxides typically contain anion oxygen the oxidation state most the earth crust consists solid the result elements being oxidized the oxygen air hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide even materials considered pure elements often develop oxide for aluminium foil develops thin skin called passivation layer that protects the foil from further corrosion different oxides the same element are distinguished roman numerals denoting their oxidation number iron oxide versus iron oxide contents formation structure molecular oxides reactivity reduction hydrolysis nomenclature and formulas examples oxides see also references formation corrosion due its electronegativity oxygen forms stable chemical bonds with almost all elements give the corresponding noble metals such gold platinum are prized because they resist direct chemical combination with and substances like gold oxide must generated indirect two independent pathways for corrosion elements are hydrolysis and oxidation the combination water and oxygen even more virtually all elements burn atmosphere oxygen rich the presence water and oxygen simply some sodium react even give the part for this alkali and alkaline earth metals are not found nature their native form caesium reactive with oxygen that used getter vacuum tubes and solutions potassium and called nak are used deoxygenate and dehydrate some organic the surface most metals consists oxides and hydroxides the presence known example aluminium foil which coated with thin film aluminium oxide that passivates the slowing further corrosion the aluminium oxide layer can built greater thickness the process electrolytic anodising though solid magnesium and aluminium react slowly with oxygen stp like most burn generating very high finely grained powders most metals can dangerously explosive consequently they are often used solid fuel rockets dry iron readily forms iron oxide but the formation the hydrated ferric that mainly comprise typically requires oxygen and water free oxygen production photosynthetic bacteria some billion years ago precipitated iron out solution the oceans the economically important iron ore hematite iron oxide rust oxides oxide hydroxide structure oxides most metals adopt polymeric structures with because these crosslinks are the solids tend insoluble though they are attacked acids and the formulas are often deceptively many are nonstoichiometric compounds these the coordination number the oxide ligand two for most electronegative elements and for most unit cell molecular oxides although most metal oxides are some oxides are the most famous molecular oxides are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide phosphorus pentoxide more complex molecular oxide with deceptive the formula being some polymeric oxides when heated depolymerize give examples being selenium dioxide and sulfur trioxide tetroxides are and there are only five known ruthenium tetroxide osmium tetroxide hassium tetroxide iridium tetroxide and xenon tetroxide many oxyanions are such polyphosphates and polyoxometalates oxycations are example being nitrosonium course many compounds are known with both oxides and other organic chemistry these include ketones and many related carbonyl compounds for the transition many oxo complexes are known well oxyhalides reactivity oxides can attacked acids and bases those attacked only acids are basic those attacked only bases are acidic oxides that react with both acids and bases are amphoteric metals tend form basic non metals tend form acidic and amphoteric oxides are formed elements near the boundary between metals and metals metalloids this reactivity the basis many practical processes the extraction some metals from their ores the process called hydrometallurgy reduction carbothermic reduction metals are won from their oxides chemical common and cheap reducing agent carbon the form coke the most prominent example that iron ore smelting many reactions are but the simplified equation usually shown metal oxides can reduced organic this redox process the basis for many important transformations such the detoxification drugs the enzymes and the production ethylene oxide which converted such systems the metal centre transfers oxide ligand the organic compound followed regeneration the metal often oxygen hydrolysis oxides more electropositive elements tend they are called basic anhydrides exposed they may form basic hydroxides for sodium oxide when forms sodium hydroxide oxides more electronegative elements tend they are called acid adding they form oxoacids for dichlorine heptoxide perchloric acid more hydrated some oxides can act both acid and they are amphoteric example aluminium oxide some oxides not show behavior either acid the oxide ion has the formula the conjugate base the hydroxide ion and encountered ionic solid such calcium oxide unstable aqueous solution its affinity for great that abstracts proton from solvent the equilibrium constant aforesaid reactions the oxides were named calxes calces after the calcination process used produce calx was later replaced oxyd nomenclature and formulas sometimes metal oxygen ratios are used name thus nbo would called niobium monoxide and tio titanium this naming follows the greek numerical prefixes the older literature and continuing oxides are named contracting the element name with hence magnesia chromia are respectively mgo special types oxides are peroxide and superoxide such oxygen assigned higher oxidation states than the chemical formulas the oxides the chemical elements their highest oxidation state are predictable and are derived from the number valence electrons for that even the chemical formula tetraoxygen predictable group element one exception copper for which the highest oxidation state oxide copper oxide and not copper oxide another exception fluoride which does not exist one might but since fluorine more electronegative than oxygen difluoride does not represent oxide but instead represents fluoride examples oxides the following table gives examples commonly encountered only few representatives are the number polyatomic ions encountered practice
