chemistry	period periodic navigation search the periodic table the elements elements are arranged series rows periods that those with similar properties appear elements the same period have the same number electron with each group across the elements have one more proton and electron and become less metallic this arrangement reflects the periodic recurrence similar properties the atomic number increases for the alkaline metals lie one group group and share similar such high reactivity and the tendency lose one electron arrive gas electronic the periodic table elements has total elements the madelung energy ordering rule modern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends properties terms electron shells atomic number shells fill with electrons approximately the order shown the filling each shell corresponds row the the block and block the periodic elements within the same period generally not exhibit trends and similarities properties vertical trends down groups are more however the block trends across periods become and the block elements show high degree similarity across periods particularly the lanthanides contents periods chemical elements the first period chemical elements the second period chemical elements the third period chemical elements the fourth period chemical elements the fifth period chemical elements the sixth period chemical elements the seventh period chemical elements the eighth period references periods seven periods elements occur naturally for period which includes elements which may synthesized after see the extended periodic table group chemistry means family objects with similarities like different there are periods going horizontally across the periodic chemical elements the first period period element group the first period contains fewer elements than any with only hydrogen and helium they therefore not follow the octet rule chemically helium behaves noble gas and thus taken part the group elements however terms its nuclear structure belongs the block and therefore sometimes classified group element simultaneously both and hydrogen readily loses and gains and behaves chemically both group and group element hydrogen the most abundant the chemical constituting roughly the elemental ionized hydrogen just proton stars the main sequence are mainly composed hydrogen its plasma state elemental hydrogen relatively rare earth and industrially produced from hydrocarbons such methane hydrogen can form compounds water and most organic compounds helium exists only gas except extreme the second lightest element and the second most abundant the most helium was formed during the big bang but new helium created through nuclear fusion hydrogen earth helium relatively only occurring byproduct the natural decay some radioactive such helium trapped within natural gas concentrations seven percent chemical elements the second period period element group period elements involve the and orbitals they include the biologically most essential elements besides carbon nitrogen and lithium the lightest metal and the least dense solid its ionized state one the most reactive and only ever found naturally compounds the heaviest primordial element forged large quantities during the big bang beryllium has one the highest melting points all the light metals small amounts beryllium were synthesised during the big bang although most decayed reacted further within stars create larger like nitrogen beryllium classified the international agency for research cancer group carcinogen between and people are sensitive beryllium and may develop inflammatory reaction their respiratory system and skin called chronic beryllium boron does not occur naturally free but compounds such borates essential plant micronutrient required for cell wall strength and cell seed and fruit sugar transport and hormone though high levels are carbon the fourth most abundant element the universe mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen and the second most abundant element the human body mass after the third most abundant number there are almost infinite number compounds that contain carbon due ability form long stable chains all organic compounds those essential for contain least one atom combined with oxygen nitrogen sulfur and carbon the basis every important biological nitrogen found mainly mostly inert diatomic gas which makes the essential component proteins and therefore oxygen comprising the atmosphere and required for respiration all nearly animals well being the principal component water oxygen the third most abundant element the and oxygen compounds dominate the fluorine the most reactive element its ionized and never found that way neon noble gas used neon lighting chemical elements the third period period element group all period three elements occur nature and have least one stable isotope all but the noble gas argon are essential basic geology and sodium alkali metal present oceans large quantities the form sodium chloride table magnesium alkaline earth metal magnesium ions are found chlorophyll aluminium other metal the most abundant metal the crust silicon metalloid semiconductor making the principal component many integrated circuits silicon dioxide the principal constituent sand phosphorus nonmetal essential dna highly reactive and such never found nature free sulfur nonmetal found two amino acids cysteine and methionine chlorine halogen used especially swimming pools argon noble gas making almost entirely incandescent lamps are often filled with noble gases such argon order preserve the filaments high chemical elements the fourth period period element group cro nicl cuso kmno period includes the biologically essential elements potassium and calcium and the first period the block with the lighter transition metals these include iron the heaviest element forged main sequence stars and principal component the well other important metals such cobalt nickel copper and zinc almost all have biological chemical elements the fifth period period element group period contains the heaviest few elements that have biological molybdenum and iodine tungsten period element the only heavier element that has biological includes technetium the lightest exclusively radioactive element chemical elements the sixth period period element group lanthanides period the first period include the block with the lanthanides also known the rare earth elements and includes the heaviest stable many these heavy metals are toxic and some are but platinum and gold are largely chemical elements the seventh period period element group actinides uut uup uus uuo all elements period are radioactive this period contains the heaviest element which occurs naturally californium all the subsequent elements the period have been synthesized whilst one these einsteinium now available macroscopic most are extremely having only been prepared microgram amounts some the later elements have only ever been identified laboratories quantities few atoms although the rarity many these elements means that experimental results are not very periodic and group trends behaviour appear less well defined for period than for other whilst francium and radium show typical properties groups and respectively the actinides display much greater variety behaviour and oxidation states than the lanthanides initial studies suggest group element flerovium appears noble gas instead other and group element ununoctium probably not noble these peculiarities period may due variety including large degree spin orbit coupling and relativistic ultimately caused the very high positive electrical charge from their massive atomic nuclei chemical elements the eighth period extended
