chloride caesium chloride potassium chlorate potassium perchlorate standard state what references the chemical compound potassium chloride metal halide salt composed potassium and chlorine its pure odorless and has white colorless vitreous crystal appearance with crystal structure that cleaves easily three potassium chloride crystals are face centered cubic potassium chloride was historically known muriate this name occasionally still encountered association with its use fertilizer potash varies color from pink red white depending the mining and recovery process white sometimes referred soluble usually higher analysis and used primarily for making liquid starter fertilizers kcl used medicine scientific and food processing occurs naturally the mineral sylvite and combination with sodium chloride sylvinite contents chemical properties physical properties synthesis and production synthesis uses biological and medical properties precautions references further reading chemical properties liquid ammonia liquid sulfur dioxide methanol formic acid sulfolane acetonitrile acetone formamide acetamide dimethylformamide chemistry and physics very commonly used for example calibration standard solution measuring electrical conductivity solutions since carefully prepared kcl solutions have reproducible and repeatable measurable potassium chloride can react source chloride ion with any other soluble ionic will precipitate insoluble chloride salts when added solution appropriate metal agno agcl although potassium more electropositive than sodium kcl can reduced the metal reaction with metallic sodium because the potassium removed distillation see principle this method the main method for producing metallic electrolysis used for fails because the high solubility potassium molten with other compounds containing kcl powdered form gives lilac flame test result physical properties potassium chloride has crystalline structure like many other its structure centered its lattice constant roughly some other properties are transmission transmittivity and rises linearly refractive index reflection loss two expansion refractive index thermal conductivity damage threshold newman novak pulse pulse rate kovalev faizullov synthesis and production potassium chloride occurs naturally sylvite carnallite and potash and can extracted from these also extracted from salt water and can manufactured crystallization from solution flotation electrostatic separation from suitable product the making nitric acid from potassium nitrate and hydrochloric acid synthesis potassium chloride inexpensively available and rarely prepared intentionally the can generated two routes that are instructive but not practical one way treat potassium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid this conversion acid base neutralization reaction the resulting salt can then purified another method would allow potassium burn the presence chlorine also very exothermic uses the majority the potassium chloride produced used for making fertilizer since the growth many plants limited their potassium chemical feedstock used for the manufacture potassium hydroxide and potassium metal also used lethal injections scientific applications food processing and free substitute for table salt sodium sometimes used water completion fluid petroleum and natural gas operations well being alternative sodium chloride household water softener units kcl useful beta radiation source for calibration radiation monitoring equipment because natural potassium contains the isotope one kilogram kcl yields becquerels radiation consisting beta and gamma with mev potassium chloride used some deicing products that are designed safer for pets and though these are inferior melting quality calcium chloride lowest usable temperature also used various brands bottled water well bulk quantities for fossil fuel drilling purposes potassium chloride was once used fire extinguishing agent used portable and wheeled fire extinguishers known dry was more effective than sodium bicarbonate based dry chemicals and was compatible with protein foam this agent fell out favor with the introduction potassium bicarbonate purple dry chemical the late which was much less corrosive and more rated for and along with sodium chloride and lithium chloride potassium chloride used flux for the gas welding aluminium potassium chloride also optical crystal with wide transmission range from while kcl crystal hygroscopic this limits its application protected environments short term uses such exposed free kcl optics will rot whereas kcl components were formerly used for infrared optics has been entirely replaced much tougher crystals like zinc selenide potassium chloride has also been used create heat packs which employ exothermic chemical reactions but these are longer being created due cheaper and more efficient such the oxidation metals hot one time use the crystallization sodium acetate multiple use potassium chloride used scotophor with designation dark trace crts the skiatron biological and medical properties potassium vital the human body and oral potassium chloride the common means replenish although can also diluted and given intravenously can used salt substitute for food but due its bitter unsalty flavor usually mixed with ordinary table salt sodium for this purpose improve the taste the addition ppm thaumatin considerably reduces this complaints bitterness chemical metallic taste are also reported with potassium chloride used medically used the treatment hypokalemia and associated conditions electrolyte replenisher brand names include klor micro slow sando and kaon side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort including nausea and vomiting diarrhea and bleeding the digestive overdoses cause hyperkalemia which can lead paresthesia cardiac conduction fibrillation arrhythmias and sclerosis prescription potassium citrate the potassium naturally found fruits and can prescribed alternative potassium slow development where the medicine formulated enter the bloodstream delayed was first only prescribed british military forces balance their diets while serving some cardiac surgery procedures cannot carried out the beating for these the surgical team will bypass the heart with heart lung machine and inject potassium chloride into the heart muscle stop the the lethal effects potassium chloride overdoses have led its use lethal injection the third drug additionally kcl used albeit fetal intracardiac injections and trimester induced abortions jack kevorkian thanatron machine injected lethal dose potassium chloride into the which caused the heart stop after sodium thiopental induced coma was precautions orally potassium chloride toxic the around meaning that lethal dose for people weighing about ounces however this not far from oral toxicity sodium chloride table thus potassium chloride harmless for alimentation and even good for see previous but without the step digestive this reduced just over most concerns are its severe effects the cardiac muscles high doses can cause cardiac arrest and rapid death thus the aforementioned use the third and final drug delivered the lethal injection process
