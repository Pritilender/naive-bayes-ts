chemical reactions which atoms have their oxidation state changed redox reactions involve the transfer electrons between species this can either simple redox such the oxidation carbon yield carbon dioxide the reduction carbon hydrogen yield methane complex process such the oxidation glucose the human body through series complex electron transfer processes the term redox comes from two concepts involved with electron reduction and can explained simple oxidation the loss electrons increase oxidation state molecule atom ion reduction the gain electrons decrease oxidation state atom although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation oxides from oxygen these are only specific examples more general concept reactions involving electron redox reduction have number similarities acid base reactions like base redox reactions are matched that there cannot oxidation reaction without reduction reaction happening the oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each called half reaction because two reactions always occur together form whole when writing the gained lost electrons are typically included explicitly order that the half reaction balanced with respect electric though sufficient for many these descriptions are not precisely oxidation and reduction properly refer change oxidation state the actual transfer electrons may never thus oxidation better defined increase oxidation state and reduction decrease oxidation state the transfer electrons will always cause change oxidation but there are many reactions that are classed redox even though electron transfer occurs such those involving covalent bonds contents etymology oxidizing and reducing agents oxidizers reducers standard electrode potentials reduction examples redox reactions metal displacement other examples corrosion and rusting redox reactions industry redox reactions biology redox cycling redox reactions geology balancing redox reactions acidic media basic media memory aids see also references external links etymology redox portmanteau reduction and oxidation the word oxidation originally implied reaction with oxygen form since dioxygen was historically the first recognized oxidizing later the term was expanded encompass like substances that accomplished parallel chemical ultimately the meaning was generalized include all processes involving loss the word reduction originally referred the loss weight upon heating metallic ore such metal oxide extract the other ore was reduced antoine lavoisier showed that this loss weight was due the loss oxygen later scientists realized that the metal atom gains electrons this the meaning reduction then became generalized include all processes involving gain even though reduction seems intuitive when speaking the gain might help think reduction the loss which was its historical the electrochemist john bockris has used the words electronation and deelectronation describe reduction and oxidation processes respectively when they occur electrodes these words are analogous protonation and deprotonation but they have not been widely adopted the term hydrogenation could used instead since hydrogen the reducing agent large number especially organic chemistry and but unlike which has been generalized beyond its root hydrogenation has maintained its specific connection reactions that add hydrogen another substance the hydrogenation unsaturated fats saturated oxidizing and reducing agents redox the reductant transfers electrons the thus the the reductant reducing agent loses electrons and and the oxidant oxidizing agent gains electrons and the pair oxidizing and reducing agent that are involved particular reaction called redox pair redox couple reducing species and its corresponding oxidized oxidizers oxidizing agent substances that have the ability oxidize other substances cause them lose are said oxidative oxidizing and are known oxidizing agents oxidants that the oxidant oxidizing removes electrons from another and thus itself and because accepts electrons the oxidizing agent also called electron acceptor hence the oxygen the quintessential oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements high oxidation states mno cro oso else highly electronegative elements that can gain extra electrons oxidizing another reducers reducing agent substances that have the ability reduce other substances cause them gain are said reductive reducing and are known reducing agents reductants the reductant reducing transfers electrons another and thus itself and because donates electrons the reducing agent also called electron donor electron donors can also form charge transfer complexes with electron reductants chemistry are very electropositive elemental metals such lithium sodium magnesium iron zinc and aluminium are good reducing these metals donate give away electrons hydride transfer reagents such nabh and lialh are widely used organic chemistry primarily the reduction carbonyl compounds alcohols another method reduction involves the use hydrogen gas with palladium platinum nickel catalyst these catalytic reductions are used primarily the reduction carbon double triple standard electrode potentials reduction each reaction has standard electrode potential which equal the potential difference voltage equilibrium under standard conditions electrochemical cell which the cathode reaction the half reaction considered and the anode standard hydrogen electrode where hydrogen the electrode potential each reaction also known its reduction potential potential when the reaction takes place the reduction potential measure the tendency the oxidizing agent its value zero for positive for oxidizing agents stronger than for and negative for oxidizing agents that are weaker than for for redox reaction that takes place the potential difference the potential the reaction the anode was sometimes expressed oxidation potential the oxidation potential measure the tendency the reducing agent but does not represent the physical potential with this the cell voltage equation written with plus sign examples redox reactions good example the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine which hydrogen being oxidized and fluorine being can write this overall reaction two half reactions the oxidation and the reduction analyzing each reaction isolation can often make the overall chemical process because there net change charge during redox the number electrons excess the oxidation reaction must equal the number consumed the reduction reaction shown elements even molecular always have oxidation state the first hydrogen oxidized from oxidation state zero oxidation state the second fluorine reduced from oxidation state zero oxidation state when adding the reactions together the electrons are and the ions combine form hydrogen fluoride the overall reaction metal displacement electrochemical cell galvanic cell this type metal atom
