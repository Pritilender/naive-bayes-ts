separation method achieve any mass transfer phenomenon that converts mixture substances into two more distinct product least one which enriched one more the some separation may fully divide the mixture into its pure separations are carried out based differences chemical physical properties such shape mass density chemical between the constituents and are often classified according the particular differences they use achieve the case that single difference can used accomplish desired multiple operations will often performed combination achieve the desired barring few almost every element compound naturally found impure often these impure raw materials must separated into their purified components before they can put productive making separation techniques essential for the modern industrial some these separations require total the electrolysis refining bauxite ore for aluminum metal but good example incomplete separation technique oil refining crude oil occurs naturally mixture various hydrocarbons and the refining process splits this mixture into more valuable mixtures such natural gas gasoline and chemical none which are pure but each which must separated from the raw both these series separations necessary obtain the desired end the case oil crude subjected long series individual distillation steps each which produces different product this article discusses separation techniques any scale that completely partially separate components mixture from each other which may referred fractions usually without substantial chemical the purpose such separation may analytical help analyze components the original mixture without any attempt save the may preparative prepare fractions samples the components that can the separation can done small effectively laboratory scale for analytical preparative large effectively industrial scale for preparative some intermediate contents chromatography list separation techniques see also references external links chromatography chromatography paper the movement each substance the mixture depends two solubility the substance the solvent and adsorption the substance the filter the substance moves with the solvent easily the substance very soluble the and some solids can attract other substances and hold them their this called and such solids are called the substance does not move with the solvent easily the substance the mixture strongly absorbed the filter since neither substance has the same adsorption and each travels different distance along the filter and the two substances separated chromatography need not colorless substances can made visible spraying the paper with locating agent that reacts with the colorless substances produce labs use chromatography identify the substances hospital for use the technique determine patient has diabetes identifying sugar chromatography also identifies dyes used list separation techniques adsorption adhesion ions molecules liquid dissolved solids surface centrifugation and cyclonic separation separates based density differences chromatography separates dissolved substances different interaction with travel material crystallization decantation demister removes liquid droplets from gas streams distillation used for mixtures liquids with different boiling points drying removes liquid from solid vaporisation electrophoresis separates organic molecules based their different interaction with gel under electric potential different elutriation evaporation extraction leaching liquid extraction solid phase extraction flotation dissolved air flotation removes suspended solids selectively from slurry bubbles that are generated air coming out solution froth flotation recovers hydrophobic solids attachment air bubbles generated mechanical agitation slurry which and are recovered deinking separating hydrophobic ink particles from hydrophilic paper pulp paper recycling flocculation separates solid from liquid use which promotes the solid clumping into flocs filtration mesh bag and paper filters are used remove large particulates suspended fluids fly ash while membrane processes including microfiltration
