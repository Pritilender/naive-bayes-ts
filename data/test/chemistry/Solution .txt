solution navigation search solution saline water table salt nacl water chemistry solution homogeneous mixture composed only one phase such solute substance dissolved another known solvent the solvent does the the solution more less takes the characteristics the solvent including its and the solvent commonly the major fraction the the concentration solute solution measure how much that solute dissolved the contents characteristics types gaseous solutions liquid solutions solid solutions solubility properties liquid preparation from constituent ingredients see also references characteristics solution homogeneous mixture the particles solute solution cannot seen naked the solution does not allow beam light scatter solution the solute from the solution cannot separated filtration types this article list format that may better presented using prose you can help converting this article appropriate editing help june homogeneous means that the components the mixture form single the properties the mixture such temperature and can uniformly distributed through the volume but only absence diffusion phenomena after their usually the substance present the greatest amount considered the solvents can liquids one more components present the solution other than the solvent are called the solution has the same physical state the gaseous solutions the solvent gas only gases are dissolved under given set example gaseous solution air oxygen and other gases dissolved since interactions between molecules play almost dilute gases form rather trivial part the they are not even classified but addressed mixtures liquid solutions the solvent liquid then liquids and solids can here are some gas oxygen water carbon dioxide water less simple because the solution accompanied chemical reaction formation note also that the visible bubbles carbonated water are not the dissolved but only effervescence carbon dioxide that has come out the dissolved gas itself not visible since dissolved molecular liquid the mixing two more substances the same chemistry but different concentrations form homogenization alcoholic beverages are basically solutions ethanol solid sucrose table sugar water sodium chloride table salt any other salt which forms electrolyte when salt dissociates into ions counterexamples are provided liquid mixtures that are not homogeneous colloids suspensions emulsions are not considered body fluids are examples for complex liquid containing many many these are electrolytes since they contain solute such potassium furthermore they contain solute molecules like sugar and urea oxygen and carbon dioxide are also essential components blood where significant changes their concentrations may sign severe illness solid solutions the solvent solid then liquids and solids can gas hydrogen dissolves rather well especially palladium this studied means hydrogen storage liquid mercury gold forming amalgam hexane paraffin wax solid steel basically solution carbon atoms crystalline matrix iron alloys like bronze and many polymers containing plasticizers solubility solubility solvation the ability one compound dissolve another compound called solubility when liquid can completely dissolve another liquid the two liquids are miscible two substances that can never mix form solution are called immiscible all solutions have positive entropy the interactions between different molecules ions may energetically favored interactions are then the free energy decreases with increasing solute some point the energy loss outweighs the entropy and more solute particles can the solution said saturated however the point which solution can become saturated can change significantly with different environmental such temperature pressure and for some solvent combinations supersaturated solution can prepared raising the solubility for example increasing the dissolve more and then lowering for example usually the greater the temperature the the more given solid solute can however most gases and some compounds exhibit solubilities that decrease with increased such behavior result exothermic enthalpy solution some surfactants exhibit this the solubility liquids liquids generally less sensitive than that solids properties the physical properties compounds such melting point and boiling point change when other compounds are together they are called colligative properties there are several ways quantify the amount one compound dissolved the other compounds collectively called concentration examples include molarity volume fraction and mole fraction the properties ideal solutions can calculated the linear combination the properties its both solute and solvent exist equal quantities such ethanol water the concepts solute and solvent become less but the substance that more often used solvent normally designated the solvent this water liquid solvent solvent classifications all types liquids can behave liquid noble gases molten molten molten covalent and molecular the practice chemistry and most solvents are molecular they can classified into polar and polar according whether their molecules possess permanent electric dipole moment another distinction whether their molecules can form hydrogen bonds protic and aprotic water the most commonly used both polar and sustains hydrogen water salts dissolve polar forming positive and negative ions that are attracted the negative and positive ends the solvent respectively the solvent hydration occurs when the charged solute ions become surrounded water standard example aqueous such solutions are called electrolytes for ionic the general rule like dissolves polar solutes dissolve polar forming polar bonds hydrogen all alcoholic beverages are aqueous solutions ethanol the other non polar solutes dissolve better polar examples are hydrocarbons such oil and grease that easily mix with each while being incompatible with example for the immiscibility oil and water leak petroleum from damaged that does not dissolve the ocean water but rather floats the preparation from constituent ingredients common practice laboratories make solution directly from its constituent there are three cases practical case amount solvent volume case amount solute mass case amount final solution volume the following and solute volume contribution considered through ideal solution case amount solvent volume solute mass case amount solute mass solvent volume case amount final solution volume solute mass solvent volume case solute mass case total solution volume same equation case example make nacl solution with water water the density resulting solution considered equal that statement holding especially for dilute the density information not see also underwater diving portal solution solute solvation molar solution percentage solution solubility equilibrium stock solution total dissolved solids common term range and can have different meanings depending the analytical method water refers the amount residue remaining after evaporation water from upper critical solution temperature lower critical solution temperature globule
