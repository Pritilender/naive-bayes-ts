obesity gout sucrose intolerance dietary recommendation religious concerns trade and economics references further reading external links physical and chemical properties sucrose molecule with nine stereocenters and many sites that are reactive can the molecule exists single isomer structural fructofuranoside the components glucose and fructose are linked via ether bond between the glucosyl subunit and the fructosyl the bond called glycosidic linkage glucose exists predominantly two isomeric pyranoses and but only one these forms links the fructose itself exists mixture furanoses each which having and isomers but only one particular isomer links the glucosyl what notable about sucrose unlike most the glycosidic bond formed between the reducing ends both glucose and and not between the reducing end one and the nonreducing end the this linkage inhibits further bonding other saccharide since contains anomeric hydroxyl classified reducing sugar sucrose crystallizes the monoclinic space group with temperature lattice parameters the purity sucrose measured polarimetry through the rotation plane polarized light solution the specific rotation using yellow light commercial samples sugar are assayed using this sucrose does not deteriorate ambient thermal and oxidative degradation sucrose does not melt high instead form caramel citation needed like other carbohydrates combusts carbon dioxide and mixing sucrose with the oxidizer potassium nitrate citation needed produces the fuel known rocket candy that used propel amateur rocket sucrose burns with chloric acid formed the reaction hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate sucrose can dehydrated with sulfuric acid form carbon rich indicated the following idealized hydrolysis hydrolysis breaks the glycosidic bond converting sucrose into glucose and fructose hydrolysis however slow that solutions sucrose can sit for years with negligible the enzyme sucrase however the reaction will proceed hydrolysis can also accelerated with such cream tartar lemon both weak likewise gastric acidity converts sucrose glucose and fructose during synthesis and biosynthesis sucrose the biosynthesis sucrose proceeds via the precursors udp glucose and fructose phosphate catalyzed the enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase the energy for the reaction gained the cleavage uridine diphosphate sucrose formed plants and cyanobacteria but not other organisms sucrose found naturally many food plants along with the monosaccharide fructose many such pineapple and apricot sucrose the main such grapes and pears fructose the main chemical synthesis although sucrose invariably isolated from natural its chemical synthesis was first achieved raymond lemieux production history sucrose sugar cane sugarloaf sugar nips history sugar the production table sugar has long some scholars claim indians discovered how crystallize sugar during the gupta dynasty around other scholars point the ancient manuscripts dated the century where one the earliest historical mentions sugar cane included along with the fact that their knowledge sugar cane was derived from further appears that about residents day india began making sugar syrup and cooling large flat bowls make raw table sugar crystals that were easier store and the local indian these crystals were called khanda which the source the word candy the army alexander the great was halted the banks river indus the refusal his troops further they saw people the indian subcontinent growing sugarcane and making granulated salt like sweet powder locally called khar pronounced sakcharon greek modern zachari their return the greek soldiers carried back some the bearing sugarcane remained limited crop for over sugar was rare commodity and traders sugar became venice the height its financial was the chief distributing center arabs started producing sicily and spain only after the crusades did begin rival honey sweetener the spanish began cultivating sugarcane the west indies and cuba the portuguese first cultivated sugarcane brazil sugar remained luxury much the world until the only the wealthy could afford the the demand for table sugar boomed europe and the century had become regarded human the use sugar grew from use cakes confectionery and chocolates suppliers marketed sugar novel such solid which required consumers use sugar nip like order break off the demand for cheaper table sugar colonization tropical islands and nations where intensive sugarcane plantations and table sugar manufacturing could growing sugar cane crop hot humid and producing table sugar high temperature sugar mills was inhumane the demand for cheap and docile labor for this first drove slave trade from africa particular west followed indentured labor trade from south asia particular millions followed millions indentured laborers were brought into the indian pacific east natal north and eastern parts south and southeast the modern ethnic mix many settled the last two has been influenced table beginning the late the production sugar became increasingly the steam engine first powered sugar mill jamaica and soon steam replaced direct firing the source process during the same europeans began experimenting with sugar production from other andreas marggraf identified sucrose beet root and his student franz achard built sugar beet processing factory silesia however the sugar industry really took off during the napoleonic wars when france and the continent were cut off from caribbean about percent the sugar was produced from today large beet refinery producing around tonnes sugar day needs permanent workforce about for hour current trends tall diffusers table sugar comes from plant two important sugar crops sugarcane saccharum and sugar beets beta vulgaris which sugar can account for the dry minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm phoenix dactylifera sorghum sorghum vulgare and the sugar maple acer saccharum sucrose obtained extraction these crops with hot concentration the extract gives from which solid sucrose can worldwide production table sugar amounted million most cane sugar comes from countries with warm because sugarcane does not tolerate sugar the other grow only cooler temperate regions and not tolerate extreme about percent sucrose derived from the rest almost all from sugar brazil india european china thailand and united states were the major producing countries the brazil produced about million tonnes table sugar while india produced million countries million china million thailand about million and united states over million the country rankings for table sugar production change with each sugarcane crop harvest and new sugar production plants are commissioned viewed asia predominates cane sugar with large contributions from china thailand and other countries combining account for global production south america comes second place with global africa and central america each produce and australia the united the and europe make the with roughly each beet sugar comes from regions with cooler northwest and eastern northern plus some areas the united states including the northern the growing season ends with the start harvesting around harvesting and processing continues until march some the availability processing plant capacity and the weather both influence the duration harvesting and the industry can store harvested beets until but damaged beet becomes effectively brazil the largest sugar exporter million tonnes the year the european union has become the largest sugar the common agricultural policy the sets maximum quotas for production match supply and and europe exports excess production quota approximately million tonnes part quota sugar gets subsidised from industry the remainder approximately sells sugar market prices without these subsidies and high import tariff make difficult for other countries export the compete with the europeans world the united states sets high sugar prices support its with the effect that many former purchasers sugar have switched corn syrup beverage moved out the country candy india consumes the most sugar million tonnes table sugar second place million and china third above million low prices sugar are expected stimulate global consumption and with exports forecast percent higher million the low prices glucose syrups produced from wheat and corn maize threaten the traditional sugar used combination with artificial sweeteners they can allow drink manufacturers produce very cost high fructose corn syrup high fructose corn syrup the usa there are tariffs the importation and subsidies for the production maize high fructose corn syrup derived from and significantly cheaper there than sucrose this has led sucrose being partially displaced industrial food production hfcs and other sucrose natural there are claims that consumption and hfcs are responsible for the obesity epidemic the following allegedly unsubstantiated assertions the that the cause obesity was consumption saturated and successful sugar industry efforts discredit conflicting reports the potential central role sugars and lesser extent see also under types cane sugarcane since the century cane sugar producers have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane order collect and filter the they then treat the liquid often with lime calcium remove impurities and then neutralize boiling the juice then allows the sediment settle the bottom for dredging while the scum rises the surface for skimming the liquid usually the process produce sugar centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallized the producers can then either sell the sugar product for use process further produce lighter the later processing may take place another factory another sugarcane major component brazilian the country top producer sugarcane such crystallized sugar and ethanol ethanol fuel the sucrose found sugarcane produces ethanol when fermented and brazil has implemented ethanol alternative fuel national beet sugar beet beet sugar producers slice the washed then extract the sugar with hot water diffuser alkaline solution milk lime and carbon dioxide from the lime then serves precipitate impurities see carbonatation after filtration clarification needed evaporation concentrates the juice content about solids and controlled crystallisation extracts the centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the which gets recycled the crystalliser when economic constraints prevent the removal more the manufacturer discards the remaining now known molasses sells producers animal sieving the resultant white sugar produces different grades for cane versus beet difficult distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and one way isotope analysis cane uses carbon fixation and beet uses carbon fixation resulting different ratio and isotopes the tests are used detect fraudulent abuse european union subsidies aid the detection adulterated fruit juice sugar cane tolerates hot climates but the production sugar cane needs approximately four times much water the production sugar therefore some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar such egypt have built new beet sugar factories since about some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period that the production sugar leaves residues that differ substantially depending the raw materials used and the place while cane molasses often used food humans find molasses from sugar beets and consequently ends mostly industrial fermentation feedstock for example alcohol distilleries animal feed once either type molasses can serve fuel for pure beet sugar difficult the although some brands label their product clearly pure cane beet sugar almost always labeled simply sugar pure interviews with the major beet producing companies revealed that many store brands private sugar products are pure beet the lot code can used identify the company and the plant from which the sugar enabling beet sugar identified the codes are culinary sugars mill white mill also called plantation crystal sugar superior sugar produced from raw exposed sulfur dioxide during the production reduce the concentration color compounds and helps prevent further color development during the crystallization although common growing this product does not store ship after few its impurities tend promote discoloration and therefore this type sugar generally limited local blanco directo blanco white sugar common india and other south asian produced precipitating many impurities out cane juice using phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide similar the carbonatation technique used beet sugar blanco directo more pure than mill white but less pure than white white refined white refined the most common form sugar north america and refined sugar made dissolving and purifying raw sugar using phosphoric acid similar the method used for blanco carbonatation process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon various filtration then further purified filtration through bed activated carbon bone char beet sugar refineries produce refined white sugar directly without intermediate raw stage clarification needed white refined sugar typically sold granulated which has been dried prevent clumping and comes various crystal sizes for home and industrial coarse grain such sanding sugar also called pearl decorating nibbed sugar sugar nibs coarse grain sugar used add sparkle and flavor atop baked goods and its large reflective crystals will not dissolve when subjected granulated familiar table with grain size about sugar are lumps for convenient consumption produced mixing granulated sugar with sugar caster castor very fine sugar named because the grains are small enough fit through castor form commonly used baking and mixed sold superfine sugar the united because its fineness dissolves more quickly than regular white sugar and thus especially useful meringues and cold castor sugar can prepared home grinding granulated sugar for couple minutes food powdered confectioner sugar icing sugar produced grinding sugar fine the manufacturer may add small amount anticaking agent prevent either cornstarch calcium phosphate brown sugar comes from the late stages sugar when sugar forms fine crystals with significant molasses content from coating white refined sugar with cane molasses brown color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses does its retaining brown sugars also tend harden exposed the although proper handling can reverse measurement dissolved sugar content scientists and the sugar industry use degrees brix symbol introduced adolf brix units measurement the mass ratio dissolved substance water sucrose solution has grams sucrose per grams put another grams sucrose sugar and grams water exist the grams the brix degrees are measured using infrared this measurement does not equate brix degrees from density refractive index because will specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead all dissolved when using one should report the result refractometric dried substance one might speak liquid having this refers measure percent weight total dried solids although not technically the same brix degrees determined through infrared renders accurate measurement sucrose since sucrose fact forms the majority dried the advent line infrared brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount dissolved sugar products economical using direct consumption history sugar refined sugar was luxury before the became widely popular the then graduated becoming necessary food the this evolution taste and demand for sugar essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social eventually table sugar became sufficiently cheap and common enough influence standard cuisine and flavored sucrose forms major element confectionery and desserts cooks use for its fructose which has almost double the sweetness makes sucrose distinctively sweet comparison other carbohydrate can also act food preservative when used sufficient sucrose important the structure many including biscuits and cakes and candy and ice cream and common ingredient many processed and called junk foods metabolism sucrose humans and other sucrose broken down into its constituent monosaccharides glucose and fructose sucrase isomaltase glycoside hydrolases which are located the membrane the microvilli lining the duodenum the resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bacteria and some sucrose digested the enzyme invertase sucrose easily assimilated macronutrient that provides quick source provoking rapid rise blood glucose upon sucrose pure carbohydrate has energy content kilocalories per gram kilojoules per overconsumption sucrose has been linked with adverse health effects dental caries tooth decay may caused oral bacteria converting including from food into acids that attack tooth when large amounts refined food that contain high percentages sucrose are beneficial nutrients can displaced from the which can contribute increased risk for chronic the rapidity with which sucrose raises blood glucose can cause problems for people suffering from defective glucose such persons with hypoglycemia diabetes mellitus sucrose can contribute the development metabolic syndrome experiment with rats that were fed diet third which was the sucrose first elevated blood levels triglycerides which induced visceral fat and ultimately resulted insulin resistance another study found that rats fed rich diets developed high triglycerides hyperglycemia and insulin resistance study recommended that the consumption containing drinks should limited due the growing number people with obesity and insulin resistance human health human beings have long sought but aside from wild have not had access the large quantities that characterize the modern studies have indicated potential links between consumption free sugars including sucrose particularly prevalent processed and health including obesity and tooth also considered source endogenous glycation processes citation needed tooth decay tooth decay dental has become prominent health hazard associated with the consumption especially oral bacteria such streptococcus mutans live dental plaque and metabolize any sugars not just but also glucose lactose fructose and cooked starches into lactic acid the resultant lactic acid lowers the the stripping minerals the process known tooth all carbon sugars and disaccharides based carbon sugars can converted dental plaque bacteria into acid that demineralizes but sucrose may uniquely useful streptococcus sanguinis formerly streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans sucrose the only dietary sugar that can converted sticky glucans like extracellular these glucans allow the bacteria adhere the tooth surface and build thick layers the anaerobic conditions deep the plaque encourage the formation which leads carious thus sucrose could enable mutans sanguinis and many other species bacteria adhere strongly and resist flow saliva although they are easily removed the glucans and levans fructose produced the plaque bacteria also act reserve food supply for the such special role sucrose the formation tooth decay much more significant light the almost universal use sucrose the most desirable sweetening widespread replacement sucrose high fructose corn syrup has not diminished the danger from smaller amounts sucrose are present the they will still sufficient for the development anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars the such the glucose and fructose glycemic index sucrose disaccharide made glucose and fructose and has glycemic index sucrose digested but has relatively low glycemic index due its content which has minimal effect blood with other sucrose digested into its components via the enzyme sucrase glucose blood and the glucose component transported into the blood and excess glucose converted temporary storage the liver named glycogen the fructose either bonded cellulose and transported out the tract processed the liver into citrates aldehydes and for the most lipid droplets citation needed the glycemic index measures the speed which glucose released into the bloodstream refined sugar containing glucose considered with other over consumption may cause increase blood sugar levels from normal over over diabetes mellitus diabetes mellitus disease that causes the body metabolize sugar occurs when the body attacks the cells producing the hormone that allows the metabolizing sugar type diabetes the cells exhibit impaired responses insulin type diabetes when glucose builds the can cause two the short cells become starved for energy because they not have access the glucose the long frequent glucose increases the acidity the damaging many the including the kidneys nerves and authorities advise diabetics avoid rich foods prevent adverse obesity the national health and nutrition examination survey and their studies part series indicate that the population the united states has increased its proportion energy consumption from carbohydrates and decreased its proportion from total fat while obesity has this along with the united nations report cited that obesity may correlate better with sugar consumption than with fat and that reducing fat consumption while increasing sugar consumption may increase the level the following table summarizes this study based the proportion energy intake from different food sources for adults years carried out the department health and human centers for disease control and national center for health hyattsville added sugar not always evident food while expected candies and soft also added wide range sweet items such potato peanut and study conducted the national academy sciences

sugar ranges from around kilograms per person per annum ethiopia around citation needed consumption per capita rises with income per capita until reaches plateau around per person per year middle income many countries subsidize sugar production the european the united japan and many developing countries subsidize domestic production and maintain high tariffs sugar prices these countries have often exceeded prices the international market three today with world market sugar futures prices currently strong such prices typically exceed world prices two within international trade especially the world trade organization the countries led brazil have long argued because these sugar markets essence exclude cane sugar the sugar producers receive lower prices than they would under free trade while both the european union and united states maintain trade agreements whereby certain developing and less developed countries can sell certain quantities sugar into their free the usual import countries outside these preferred trade gimes have complained that these arrangements violate the most favoured nation principle international this has led numerous tariffs and levies the the wto
