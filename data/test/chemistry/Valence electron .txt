chemistry	valence electron navigation search covalent bonds valence valence electron electron that associated with atom and that can participate the formation chemical bond single covalent bond both atoms the bond contribute one valence electron order form shared pair the presence valence electrons can determine the chemical properties and whether may bond with other for main group element valence electron can only the outermost electron shell transition metal valence electron can also inner atom with closed shell valence electrons corresponding electron configuration tends chemically inert atom with one two valence electrons more than closed shell highly because the extra valence electrons are easily removed form positive ion atom with one two valence electrons fewer than closed shell also highly because tendency either gain the missing valence electrons thereby forming negative share valence electrons thereby forming covalent like electron inner valence electron has the ability absorb release energy the form photon energy gain can trigger electron move outer this known atomic excitation the electron can even break free from its associated valence this ionization form positive when electron loses energy thereby causing photon then can move inner shell which not fully contents the number valence electrons electron configuration chemical reactions electrical conductivity references external links the number valence electrons the number valence electrons element can determined the periodic table group vertical which the element with the exception groups the transition metals the units digit the group number identifies how many valence electrons are associated with neutral atom element listed under that particular periodic table periodic table group alkali metals alkaline earth metals transition metals boron group carbon group pnictogens chalcogens halogens noble gases the general method for counting valence electrons generally not useful for transition instead the modified electron count method except for helium which has only two valence electron configuration for main group element the number valence electrons that may have depends the electron configuration simple however for transition metal the relationship more for main group valence electron defined electron that resides the electronic shell highest principal quantum number for example the electronic configuration phosphorus that there are valence electrons corresponding maximum valence for the molecule this configuration normally abbreviated where signifies the core electrons whose configuration identical that the noble gas neon however this simple method does not work for transition which have incomplete subshells whose energy normally comparable with that instead valence electron for transition metal defined electron that resides outside gas for manganese has configuration this abbreviated where denotes core configuration identical that the noble gas argon this electron has energy similar that and much higher than that there are possibly seven valence electrons outside the like this consistent with the chemical fact that manganese can have oxidation state high the permanganate ion mno the farther right each transition metal the lower the energy electron subshell and the less such electron has the properties valence thus although nickel atom ten valence electrons its oxidation state never exceeds because the number valence electrons which actually participate chemical reactions difficult the concept the valence electron less useful for transition metal than for main group mentioned the electron count provides more useful tool for understanding the chemistry transition chemical reactions valence the number electrons outermost valence shell governs its bonding behavior therefore elements whose atoms can have the same number valence electrons are grouped together the periodic table the general main group element except hydrogen tends react form closed shell corresponding the electron configuration this tendency called the octet rule because each bonded atom has eight valence electrons including shared the most reactive kind metallic element alkali metal group sodium potassium this because such atom has only single valence during the formation ionic bond which provides the necessary ionization energy this one valence electron easily lost form positive ion with closed shell alkaline earth metal group magnesium somewhat less because each atom must lose two valence electrons form positive ion with closed shell within each group each periodic table reactivity increases with each lower row the table from light element heavier because heavier element has more electron shells than lighter heavier valence electrons exist higher principal quantum numbers they are farther away from the nucleus the and are thus higher potential which means they are less tightly nonmetal atom tends attract additional valence electrons attain full valence this can achieved one two atom can either share electrons with neighboring atom covalent bond can remove electrons from another atom ionic bond the most reactive kind nonmetal element halogen fluorine chlorine such atom has the following electron this requires only one additional valence electron form closed form ionic halogen atom can remove electron from another atom order form anion etc form covalent one electron from the halogen and one electron from another atom form shared pair the molecule the line represents shared pair valence one from and one from within each group reactivity decreases with each lower rows the table from light element heavy the periodic because the valence electrons are progressively higher energies and thus progressively less tightly oxygen the lightest element group the most reactive nonmetal after even though not because the valence shell halogen higher principal quantum these simple cases where the octet rule the valence atom equals the number electrons lost shared order form the stable however there are also many molecules which are exceptions and for which the valence less clearly electrical conductivity valence electrons are also responsible for the electrical conductivity element may classified metal nonmetals semiconductors metalloid metal element with high electrical conductivity malleability when the solid state each row the periodic table the metals occur the left the and thus metal has fewer possible valence electrons than however valence electron metal atom has small ionization energy and the solid state this valence electron relatively free leave one atom order associate with another such free electron can moved under the influence electric field and its motion constitutes electric current responsible for the electrical conductivity the copper aluminium silver and gold are examples good nonmetallic element has low electrical acts insulator such element found toward the right the periodic and has valence shell that least half full the exception boron its ionization energy electron cannot leave atom easily when electric field and thus such element can conduct only very small electric examples solid elemental insulators are diamond allotrope carbon and sulfur solid compound containing metals can also insulator the valence electrons the metal atoms are used form ionic bonds for although elemental sodium solid sodium chloride because the valence electron sodium transferred chlorine form ionic and thus that electron cannot moved semiconductor has electrical conductivity that intermediate between that metal and that semiconductor also differs from metal that conductivity increases with temperature the typical elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium each atom which has four valence the properties semiconductors are best explained using band theory consequence small energy gap between valence band which contains the valence electrons absolute and conduction band which valence electrons are excited thermal
