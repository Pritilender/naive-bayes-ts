computer science	automated reasoning navigation search automated reasoning area computer science and mathematical logic dedicated understanding different aspects reasoning the study automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers reason nearly automatically although automated reasoning considered field artificial intelligence also has connections with theoretical computer science and even philosophy the most developed subareas automated reasoning are automated theorem proving and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield interactive theorem proving and automated proof checking viewed guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed extensive work has also been done reasoning analogy induction and abduction other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non monotonic reasoning important part the uncertainty field that where further constraints minimality and consistency are applied top the more standard automated john oscar system example automated argumentation system that more specific than being just automated theorem tools and techniques automated reasoning include the classical logics and fuzzy logic bayesian inference reasoning with maximal entropy and large number less formal hoc techniques contents early years significant contributions proof systems applications see also conferences and workshops journals communities references external links early years the development formal logic played big role the field automated which itself led the development artificial intelligence formal proof proof which every logical inference has been checked back the fundamental axioms all the intermediate logical steps are without appeal made even the translation from intuition logic thus formal proof less and less susceptible logical some consider the cornell summer meeting which brought together large number logicians and computer the origin automated automated deduction others say that began before that with the logic theorist program shaw and with martin implementation presburger decision procedure which proved that the sum two even numbers automated although significant and popular area went through winter the eighties and early luckily got revived after for microsoft started using verification technology many their internal projects and planning include logical specification and checking language their version visual significant contributions principia mathematica was milestone work formal logic written alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell principia mathematica also meaning principles mathematics was written with purpose derive all some the mathematical expressions terms symbolic logic principia mathematica was initially published three volumes and logic theorist was the first ever program developed allen newell cliff shaw and herbert simon mimic human proving theorems and was demonstrated two theorems from chapter two principia proving eight addition proving the the program found proof for one the theorems that was more elegant than the one provided whitehead and after unsuccessful attempt publishing their newell shaw and herbert reported their publication the next advance operation research there are now the world machines that that learn and that moreover their ability these things going increase rapidly until visible the range problems they can handle will extensive with the range which the human mind has been examples formal proofs first incompleteness moore del quadratic reciprocity moore eisenstein calculus hol light algebra mizar algebra coq

boyer moore theorem prover the design this system was influenced john mccarthy and woody started scotland this was fully automatic theorem prover built using pure lisp the main aspects nqthm hol light written ocaml hol light designed have simple and clean logical foundation and uncluttered essentially another proof assistant for classical higher order coq developed coq another automated proof which can automatically extract executable programs from either objective caml haskell source properties programs and proofs are formalized the same language called the calculus inductive constructions applications automated reasoning has been most commonly used build automated theorem some cases such provers have come with new approaches proving logic theorist good example the program came with proof for one the theorems principia mathematica that was more efficient requiring fewer than the proof provided whitehead and automated reasoning programs are being applied solve growing number problems formal mathematics and computer logic software and hardware circuit design and many the tptp sutcliffe and suttner library such problems that updated regular there also competition among automated theorem provers held regularly the cade conference sutcliffe and suttner the problems for the competition are selected from the tptp see also automated theorem proving reasoning system
