bottleneck bottlenecks navigation search bottleneck bottleneck phenomenon where the performance capacity entire system limited single limited number components the term bottleneck taken from the assets are metaphor water poured out the rate outflow limited the width the conduit that bottleneck increasing the width the bottleneck one can increase the rate which the water flows out the neck different such limiting components system are sometimes referred bottleneck points contents project management management software engineering traffic bottlenecks software bottlenecks min fairness population genetics see also references project management bottleneck project management one process chain such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity the whole related concepts project management critical path method theory constraints and example the lack smelter and refinery supply which cause bottlenecks another example surface mount technology board assembly line with several pieces equipment usually the common sense driven set and shift the bottleneck element towards the end the inducing the better and faster machines always keep the pcb supply flowing never allowing the slower ones fully fact that would heeded deleterious and significant overall drawback the management bottleneck occurs decision making four bottlenecks that may global versus local center versus business unit function versus function inside versus outside partners software engineering software engineering bottleneck occurs when the capacity application computer system severely limited single the bottleneck has lowest throughput all parts the transaction system designers will try avoid bottlenecks and direct effort towards locating and tuning existing some examples possible engineering bottlenecks processor communication link disk etc any system application will hit bottleneck the work arrives sufficiently fast traffic traffic bottleneck metaphorically bottleneck section route with carrying capacity substantially below that characterizing other sections the same this often narrow part road perhaps also with smaller number reduction the number tracks railway line may due narrow bridge tunnel deep cutting narrow locations road where speed must kept low due safety work progress part the road capacity bottlenecks are the most vulnerable points network and are very often the subject offensive defensive military capacity bottlenecks strategic importance such the panama canal where traffic limited the infrastructure are normally referred chokepoints capacity bottlenecks tactical value are referred mobility corridors bottlenecks software computer programming tracking down bottlenecks sometimes known hot sections the code that execute most frequently have the highest execution called performance analysis reduction usually achieved with the help specialized known performance analyzers profilers the objective being make those particular sections code perform fast possible improve overall algorithmic efficiency bottlenecks min fairness communication network sometimes max min fairness the network usually opposed the basic first come served policy with min data flow between any two nodes but only the cost more equally expensive data put another case network congestion any data flow only impacted smaller equal such bottleneck link for given data flow link that fully utilized saturated and all the flows sharing this the given data flow achieves maximum data rate note that this definition substantially different from common meaning bottleneck also that this definition does not forbid single link bottleneck for multiple data rate allocation min fair and only data flow between any two nodes has least one bottleneck population genetics population genetics population bottleneck occurs when the effective population sharply decreases small percentage the the immediate effect population bottleneck decrease genetic promoting the effects stochastic genetic drift over natural selection the repeated population bottlenecks can severely decrease population deleterious alleles are able accumulate especially where the time interval between bottlenecks does not allow for the generation new alleles through see also liebig law the minimum choke point performance engineering performance analysis theory constraints optimization computer fairness measure max min fairness population bottleneck reverse salient
