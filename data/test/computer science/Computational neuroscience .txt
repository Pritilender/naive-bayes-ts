field which until that point was referred variety such neural brain theory and neural the proceedings this definitional meeting were published the book computational neuroscience the first open international meeting focused computational neuroscience was organized james bower and john miller san california and has continued each year since the annual cns meeting the first graduate educational program computational neuroscience was organized the computational and neural systems program the california institute technology the early historical roots the field can traced the work people such louis lapicque hodgkin huxley hubel wiesel and david marr name lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model the neuron seminal article published this model still one the most popular models computational neuroscience for both cellular and neural networks studies well mathematical neuroscience because its simplicity see the recent review article published recently for the centenary original about years hodgkin huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical model the action potential hubel wiesel discovered that neurons the primary visual cortex the first cortical area process information coming from the retina have oriented receptive fields and are organized david work focused the interactions between suggesting computational approaches the study how functional groups neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact store process and transmit computational modeling biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work wilfrid rall with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory major topics research computational neuroscience can roughly categorized into several lines most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models biological single neuron modeling biological neuron models even single neurons have complex biophysical hodgkin and original model only employed two sensitive the acting sodium and the rectifying though successful predicting the timing and qualitative features the action nevertheless failed predict number important features such adaptation and shunting scientists now believe that there are wide variety sensitive and the implications the differing modulations and sensitivity these currents important topic computational the computational functions complex dendrites are also under intense there large body literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties some models are also tracking biochemical pathways very small scales such spines synaptic there are many software such genesis and neuron that allow rapid and systematic silico modeling realistic blue brain project founded henry markram from the cole polytechnique rale lausanne aims construct biophysically detailed simulation cortical column the blue gene supercomputer development axonal and guidance how axons and dendrites form during how axons know where target and how reach these how neurons migrate the proper position the central and peripheral how synapses know from molecular biology that distinct parts the nervous system release distinct chemical from growth factors hormones that modulate and influence the growth and development functional connections between theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning synaptic connection and morphology are still one hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention the minimal wiring hypothesis which postulates that the formation axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information sensory processing early models sensory processing understood within theoretical framework are credited horace barlow somewhat similar the minimal wiring hypothesis described the preceding barlow understood the processing the early sensory systems form efficient coding where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis one form current research sensory processing divided among biophysical modelling different subsystems and more theoretical modelling current models perception have suggested that the brain performs some form bayesian inference and integration different sensory information generating our perception the physical citation needed memory and synaptic plasticity synaptic plasticity earlier models memory are primarily based the postulates hebbian learning biologically relevant models such hopfield net have been developed address the properties rather than style memory that occur biological these attempts are primarily focusing the formation and long term memory localizing the hippocampus models working memory relying theories network oscillations and persistent have been built capture some features the prefrontal cortex related one the major problems neurophysiological memory how maintained and changed through multiple time unstable synapses are easy train but also prone stochastic stable synapses forget less but they are also harder one recent computational hypothesis involves cascades plasticity that allow synapses function multiple time stereochemically detailed models the acetylcholine receptor based synapse with the monte carlo method working the time scale have been likely that computational tools will contribute greatly our understanding how synapses function and change relation external stimulus the coming behaviors networks biological neurons are connected each other recurrent these connections unlike most artificial neural networks sparse and usually not known how information transmitted through such sparsely connected also unknown what the computational functions these specific connectivity patterns the interactions neurons small network can often reduced simple models such the ising model the statistical mechanics such simple systems are characterized there has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics arbitrary neuronal networks can reduced pairwise not however whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational with the emergence two photon microscopy and calcium imaging now have powerful experimental methods with which test the new theories regarding neuronal some cases the complex interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can simplified using mean field theory which gives rise the population model neural while many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends including much neuronal and network structure models this type are typically built large simulation platforms like genesis there have been some attempts provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels cognition discrimination and learning computational modeling higher cognitive functions has only recently experimental data comes primarily from single unit recording primates the frontal lobe and parietal lobe function integrators information from multiple sensory there are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits these areas may carry out biologically relevant the brain seems able discriminate and adapt particularly well certain for human beings seem have enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing one the key goals computational neuroscience dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes building intelligent the scale organizational principles are illuminated many including psychology and clinical integrative neuroscience attempts consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases behavioral measures and these are the bases for some quantitative modeling scale brain the computational representational understanding mind crum another attempt modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired based systems decision making and the manipulation visual representations decision consciousness one the ultimate goals neuroscience able explain the everyday experience conscious francis crick and christof koch made some attempts formulating consistent framework for future work neural correlates consciousness though much the work this field remains see also biological neuron models computer interface connectionism mind uploading neural coding neural engineering neural network neurocomputational speech processing
