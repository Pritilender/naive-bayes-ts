computer architecture navigation search this article needs attention from expert electronics the specific problem large amounts technical and unreferenced see the talk page for wikiproject electronics its portal may able help recruit august electronics engineering and computer engineering computer architecture set disciplines that describes computer system specifying its parts and their for high computer architecture may concerned with how the central processing unit acts and how uses computer memory some fashionable computer architectures include cluster computing and non uniform memory access computer architects use computers design new emulation software can run programs written proposed instruction while the design very easy change this compiler designers often collaborate with the suggesting improvements the instruction modern emulators may measure time clock estimate energy consumption and give realistic estimates code size these affect the convenience the the life and the size and expense the largest physical its that they help estimate the value computer contents history subcategories role definition instruction set architecture computer organization implementation design goals performance power consumption see also notes references external links history the first documented computer architecture was the correspondence between charles babbage and ada lovelace describing the analytical engine two other early and important examples john von neumann paper first draft report the edvac which described organization logical ibm used this develop the ibm the first commercial stored program computer delivered early and alan turing proposed electronic calculator also for what was become pilot ace and ace the term computer literature can traced the work lyle johnson mohammad usman khan and frederick brooks members the machine organization department main research johnson had the opportunity write proprietary research communication about the stretch developed supercomputer for los alamos scientific describe the level detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished noted that his description instruction hardware and speed enhancements were the level system term that seemed more useful than machine subsequently brooks stretch started chapter book planning computer project buchholz computer like other the art determining the needs the user structure and then designing meet those needs effectively possible within economic and technological brooks went help develop the ibm now called the ibm zseries line which became noun defining what the user needs later computer users came use the term many explicit the earliest computer architectures were designed paper and then directly built into the final hardware later computer architecture prototypes were physically built the form ttl computer such the prototypes the and the risc tested and before committing the final hardware the new computer architectures are typically built tested and tweaked inside some other computer architecture computer architecture simulator inside fpga soft microprocessor both before committing the final hardware subcategories the discipline computer architecture has three main instruction set architecture the isa defines the codes that central processor reads and acts the machine language assembly language including the instruction set word size memory address modes processor registers and address and data microarchitecture also known computer organization describes the data data processing elements and data storage and describes how they should implement the the size cpu cache for organizational issue that generally has nothing with the system design includes all the other hardware components within computing these data such computer buses and switches memory controllers and hierarchies data processing other than the such direct memory access miscellaneous issues such virtualization multiprocessing and software features some architects companies such intel and amd use finer macroarchitecture architectural layers more abstract than isa instruction set architecture above but assembly smart assembler may convert abstract assembly language common group machines into slightly different machine language for different implementations programmer visible higher level language tools such compilers may define consistent interface contract programmers using abstracting differences between underlying uisa and the java standards define different programmer visible macroarchitecture although practice the microarchitecture for particular computer includes uisa microcode instruction set family machines with different hardware level microarchitectures may share common microcode and hence pin the hardware functions that microprocessor should provide hardware the pins ferr ignne also messages that the processor should emit that external caches can invalidated pin architecture functions are more flexible than isa functions because external hardware can adapt new change from pin the term architecture fits because the functions must provided for compatible even the detailed method role definition the purpose design computer that maximizes performance while keeping power consumption costs low relative the amount expected and also very for many aspects are considered which includes instruction set functional logic and the implementation involves integrated circuit packaging power and optimization the design requires familiarity with operating systems logic design and instruction set architecture instruction set architecture instruction set architecture the interface between the software and hardware and also can viewed the view the computers not understand high level languages which have language elements that translate directly into native opcodes processor only understands instructions encoded some numerical usually binary numbers software such compilers translate high level such into besides the isa defines items the computer that are available data types registers addressing modes and instructions locate operands with register indexes and memory addressing the isa computer usually described small book which describes how the instructions are also may define short mnenonic names for the the names can recognized software development tool called assembler assembler computer program that translates readable form the isa into readable disassemblers are also widely usually debuggers software programs isolate and correct malfunctions binary computer isas vary quality and good isa compromises between programmer convenience more operations can cost the computer interpret the instructions cheaper speed the computer faster and size the code smaller for instruction isa inexpensive and subtract and jump was actually used the ssem but was not convenient helpful make programs memory organization defines how instructions interact with the and also how different parts memory interact with each computer organization microarchitecture computer organization helps optimize based for software engineers need know the processing ability they may need optimize software order gain the most performance the least this can require quite detailed analysis the computer for multimedia the designers might need arrange for most data processed the fastest data path and the various components are assumed place and task investigate the organisational structure verify the computer parts computer organization also helps plan the selection processor for particular multimedia projects may need very rapid data while supervisory software may need fast sometimes certain tasks need additional components for computer capable virtualization needs virtual memory hardware that the memory different simulated computers can kept computer organization and features also affect power consumption and processor implementation once instruction set and architecture are practical machine must this design process called the implementation implementation usually not considered architectural but rather hardware design engineering implementation can further broken down into several not fully steps logic implementation designs the blocks defined the architecture the register transfer level and logic gate level circuit implementation does transistor level designs basic elements multiplexers latches well some larger blocks alus caches that may implemented this even the physical for performance physical implementation draws physical the different circuit components are placed chip floorplan board and the wires connecting them are design validation tests the computer whole see works all situations and all once implementation the first design validations are simulations using logic however this usually too slow run realistic after making prototypes are constructed using programmable arrays fpgas many hobby projects stop this the final step test prototype integrated integrated circuits may require several redesigns fix for cpus the entire implementation process often called cpu design design goals the exact form computer system depends the constraints and computer architectures usually trade off power versus cost memory latency latency the amount time that takes for information from one node travel the and sometimes other such size weight reliability and expandability are also the most common scheme does depth power analysis and figures out how keep power consumption while maintaining adequate performance modern computer performance often described mips per mhz millions instructions per millions cycles clock speed this measures the efficiency the architecture any clock since faster clock can make faster this widely applicable historic computers had mhz low see instructions per second simple modern processors easily reach near superscalar processors may reach three five executing several instructions per clock multicore and vector processing cpus can multiply this further acting lot data per which have several cpus executing counting machine language instructions would misleading because they can varying amounts work different the instruction the standard measurements not count the actual machine language but historical unit usually based the speed the vax computer historically many people measured speed the clock rate usually mhz this refers the cycles per second the main clock the however this metric somewhat machine with higher clock rate may not necessarily have higher result manufacturers have moved away from clock speed measure other factors influence such the mix functional units bus speeds available and the type and order instructions the programs being typical home the most reliable way speed performance usually add random access memory more ram increases the likelihood that needed data program the system less likely need move memory data from the the disk often ten thousand times slower than ram because has mechanical parts that must move access its there are two main types latency and latency the time between the start process and its throughput the amount work done per unit interrupt latency the guaranteed maximum response time the system electronic event when the disk drive finishes moving some performance affected very wide range design choices for pipelining processor usually makes latency worse but makes throughput computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt these computers operate real time environment and fail operation not completed specified amount for computer controlled lock brakes must begin braking within short time after the brake pedal the performance computer can measured using other depending upon its application system may cpu bound numerical bound webserving memory bound video power consumption has become important servers and portable devices like benchmarking tries take all these factors into account measuring the time computer takes run through series test although benchmarking shows may not help one choose often the measured machines split different for one system might handle scientific applications while another might play popular video games more furthermore designers may add special features their hardware that permit specific benchmark execute quickly but offer similar advantages general power consumption low power electronics power consumption another measurement that important modern power efficiency can often traded for speed lower the typical measurement this case millions instructions per second per modern circuits have less power per transistor the number transistors per chip therefore power efficiency has increased recent processor designs such the intel core put more emphasis increasing power also the world embedded power efficiency has long been and remains important goal next throughput and see also electronics portal computing portal comparison cpu
