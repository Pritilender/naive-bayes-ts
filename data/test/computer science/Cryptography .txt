cryptography navigation search secret code cryptology german lorenz cipher world general staff cryptography cryptology from greek secret and graphein writing logia study respectively the practice and study techniques for secure communication the presence third parties called adversaries more about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence adversaries and which are related various aspects information security such data confidentiality data integrity authentication and non repudiation modern cryptography intersects the disciplines mathematics computer science and electrical engineering applications cryptography include atm cards computer passwords and electronic commerce cryptography prior the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption the conversion information from readable state apparent nonsense the originator encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed recover the original information only with intended thereby precluding unwanted persons the since world and the advent the the methods used carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more modern cryptography heavily based mathematical theory and computer science cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions making such algorithms hard break practice any theoretically possible break such but infeasible any known practical these schemes are therefore termed computationally theoretical improvements integer factorization algorithms and faster computing technology require these solutions continually there exist information theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot broken even with unlimited computing example the one time pad but these schemes are more difficult implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure cryptology related technology has raised number legal the united additions the regulation investigatory powers act require

cryptography referred almost exclusively encryption which the process converting ordinary information called plaintext into unintelligible text called ciphertext decryption the other moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back cipher cypher pair algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing the detailed operation cipher controlled both the algorithm and each instance key this secret ideally known only the usually short string which needed decrypt the cryptosystem the ordered list elements finite possible finite possible finite possible and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond each keys are ciphers without variable keys can trivially broken with only the knowledge the cipher used and are therefore useless even for most historically ciphers were often used directly for encryption decryption without additional procedures such authentication integrity colloquial use the term code often used mean any method encryption concealment however code has more specific means the replacement unit plaintext meaningful word with code word for replaces codes are longer used serious except incidentally for such things unit designations bronco flight operation since properly chosen ciphers are both more practical and more secure than even the best codes and also are better adapted computers cryptanalysis the term used for the study methods for obtaining the meaning encrypted information without access the key normally required the study how crack encryption algorithms their some use the terms cryptography and cryptology interchangeably while others including military practice use cryptography refer specifically the use and practice cryptographic techniques and cryptology refer the combined study cryptography and english more flexible than several other languages which cryptology done always used the second sense the english wikipedia the general term used for the entire field cryptography done rfc advises that steganography sometimes included the study characteristics languages which have some application cryptography frequency letter universal etc called history cryptography and cryptanalysis history cryptography before the modern cryptography was concerned solely with message confidentiality encryption conversion messages from comprehensible form into incomprehensible one and back again the other rendering unreadable interceptors eavesdroppers without secret knowledge namely the key needed for decryption that encryption was used attempt ensure secrecy communications such those spies military and diplomats recent the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns include techniques for message integrity sender receiver identity authentication digital signatures interactive proofs and secure computation among classic cryptography ancient greek scytale the earliest forms secret writing required little more than writing implements since most people could not more literate required actual the main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers which rearrange the order letters message hello becomes ehlol trivially simple rearrangement and substitution ciphers which systematically replace letters groups letters with other letters groups letters fly becomes gmz replacing each letter with the one following the latin alphabet simple versions either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising early substitution cipher was the caesar cipher which each letter the plaintext was replaced letter some fixed number positions further down the suetonius reports that julius caesar used with shift three communicate with his atbash example early hebrew the earliest known use cryptography some carved ciphertext stone egypt bce but this may have been done for the amusement literate observers rather than way concealing the greeks classical times are said have known ciphers the scytale transposition cipher claimed have been used the spartan military steganography hiding even the existence message keep was also first developed ancient early from herodotus concealed tattoo shaved under the regrown more modern examples steganography include the use invisible ink microdots and digital watermarks conceal ciphertexts produced classical cipher and some modern always reveal statistical information about the which can often used break after the discovery frequency analysis perhaps the arab mathematician and polymath kindi also known alkindus the nearly all such ciphers became more less readily breakable any informed such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity though mostly puzzles see cryptogram kindi wrote book cryptography entitled risalah istikhraj amma manuscript for the deciphering cryptographic messages which described the first cryptanalysis techniques french henri france gabriel luetz aramon french ambassador the ottoman empire essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development the polyalphabetic most clearly leon battista alberti around the year though there some indication that was already known alberti innovation was use different ciphers substitution for various parts message perhaps for each successive plaintext letter the also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device wheel which implemented partial realization his the polyalphabetic vigen cipher encryption uses key word which controls letter substitution depending which letter the key word the century charles babbage showed that the cipher was vulnerable kasiski examination but this was first published about ten years later friedrich kasiski although frequency analysis powerful and general technique against many encryption has still often been effective many cryptanalyst was unaware the breaking message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge the cipher used and perhaps the key thus making bribery burglary defection etc more attractive approaches the cryptanalytically was finally explicitly recognized the century that secrecy algorithm not sensible nor practical safeguard message was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme including should remain secure even the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm security the key used should alone sufficient for good cipher maintain confidentiality under this fundamental principle was first explicitly stated auguste kerckhoffs and generally called kerckhoffs principle alternatively and more was restated claude shannon the inventor information theory and the fundamentals theoretical shannon maxim the enemy knows the different physical devices and aids have been used assist with one the earliest may have been the scytale ancient greece rod supposedly used the spartans aid for transposition cipher see image medieval other aids were invented such the cipher grille which was also used for kind with the invention polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such own cipher disk johannes trithemius tabula recta scheme and thomas jefferson multi cylinder not publicly and reinvented independently bazeries around many mechanical decryption devices were invented early the and several among them rotor machines famously including the enigma machine used the german government and military from the late and during world war the ciphers implemented better quality examples these machine designs brought about substantial increase cryptanalytic difficulty after computer era cryptanalysis the new mechanical devices proved both difficult and the united cryptanalytic efforts bletchley park during wwii spurred the development more efficient means for carrying out repetitious this culminated the development the colossus the first fully digital programmable computer which assisted the decryption ciphers generated the german lorenz machine just the development digital computers and electronics helped made possible much more complex furthermore computers allowed for the encryption any kind data representable any binary unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language this was new and computer use has thus supplanted linguistic both for cipher design and many computer ciphers can characterized their operation binary bit sequences sometimes groups unlike classical and mechanical which generally manipulate traditional characters letters and directly however computers have also assisted which has compensated some extent for increased cipher nonetheless good modern ciphers have stayed ahead typically the case that use quality cipher very efficient fast and requiring few such memory cpu while breaking requires effort many orders magnitude and vastly larger than that required for any classical making cryptanalysis inefficient and impractical effectively extensive open academic research into cryptography relatively began only the recent ibm personnel designed the algorithm that became the federal data encryption standard whitfield diffie and martin hellman published their key agreement algorithm and the rsa algorithm was published martin gardner scientific american column since cryptography has become widely used tool computer networks and computer security some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret certain mathematical problems are such the integer factorization the discrete logarithm problems there are deep connections with abstract there are absolute proofs that cryptographic technique secure but see one time pad there are proofs that some techniques are secure some computational problem difficult certain assumptions about implementation practical use are well being aware cryptographic cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working their for continuous improvements computer processing power have increased the scope brute force attacks thus when specifying key lengths the required key lengths are similarly the potential effects quantum computing are already being considered some cryptographic system the announced imminence small implementations these machines may making the need for this preemptive caution rather more than merely essentially prior the early cryptography was chiefly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns since then the emphasis has and cryptography now makes extensive use including aspects information theory computational complexity statistics combinatorics abstract algebra number theory and finite mathematics cryptography also branch engineering but unusual one deals with intelligent and malevolent opposition see cryptographic engineering and security engineering other kinds engineering civil chemical need deal only with neutral natural there also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics see quantum cryptography and quantum computer modern cryptography the modern field cryptography can divided into several areas the chief ones are discussed see topics cryptography for symmetric key cryptography symmetric key algorithm key cryptography refers encryption methods which both the sender and receiver share the same key less which their keys are but related easily computable this was the only kind encryption publicly known until june patented idea pgp mail symmetric key ciphers are implemented either block ciphers stream ciphers block cipher enciphers input blocks plaintext opposed individual the input form used stream the data encryption standard and the advanced encryption standard are block cipher designs which have been designated cryptography standards the government though designation was finally withdrawn after the aes was despite its deprecation official des especially its approved and much more secure triple des variant remains quite used across wide range from atm encryption mail privacy and secure remote access many other block ciphers have been designed and with considerable variation many have been thoroughly such feal stream contrast the type create arbitrarily long stream key which combined with the plaintext bit somewhat like the one time pad stream the output stream created based hidden internal state which changes the cipher that internal state initially set using the secret key widely used stream see category stream ciphers block ciphers can used stream see block cipher modes operation cryptographic hash functions are third type cryptographic they take message any length and output fixed length hash which can used for digital for good hash attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same used hash function which now strengthened variant also widely used but broken the national security agency developed the secure hash algorithm series like hash sha was flawed algorithm that the agency sha widely deployed and more secure than but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against the sha family improves but yet widely and the standards authority thought prudent from security perspective develop new standard significantly improve the robustness overall hash algorithm thus hash function design competition was meant select new national called sha the competition ended october when the nist announced that keccak would the new hash message authentication codes are much like cryptographic hash except that secret key can used authenticate the hash value upon public key cryptography public key cryptography key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption though message group messages may have different key than significant disadvantage symmetric ciphers the key management necessary use them each distinct pair communicating parties ideally share different and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged the number keys required increases the square the number network which very quickly requires complex key management schemes keep them all consistent and the difficulty securely establishing secret key between two communicating when secure channel does not already exist between also presents chicken egg problem which considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users the real whitfield diffie martin hellman groundbreaking paper whitfield diffie and martin hellman proposed the notion public key more called asymmetric key cryptography which two different but mathematically related keys are public key and private key public key system constructed that calculation one key the private computationally infeasible from the other the public even though they are necessarily instead both keys are generated interrelated the historian david kahn described key cryptography the most revolutionary new concept the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged the key the public key may freely while its paired private key must remain key encryption the public key used for while the private secret key used for while diffie and hellman could not find such they showed that key cryptography was indeed possible presenting the diffie hellman key exchange protocol solution that now widely used secure communications allow two parties secretly agree shared encryption key diffie and publication sparked widespread academic efforts finding practical key encryption this race was finally won ronald rivest adi shamir and len adleman whose solution has since become known the rsa algorithm the hellman and rsa addition being the first publicly known examples high quality key have been among the most widely others include the cramer shoup cryptosystem elgamal encryption and various elliptic curve techniques see category key cryptosystems much document published the government communications headquarters gchq british intelligence revealed that cryptographers gchq had anticipated several academic reportedly around james ellis had conceived the principles asymmetric key clifford cocks invented solution that essentially resembles the rsa and malcolm williamson claimed have developed the hellman key firefox web browser citation needed key cryptography can also used for implementing digital signature schemes digital signature reminiscent ordinary signature they both have the characteristic being easy for user but difficult for anyone else forge digital signatures can also permanently tied the content the message being they cannot then from one document for any attempt will digital signature there are two one for signing which secret key used process the message hash the and one for verification which the matching public key used with the message check the validity the rsa and dsa are two the most popular digital signature digital signatures are central the operation public key infrastructures and many network security schemes ssl tls many vpns etc public key algorithms are most often based the computational complexity hard problems often from number theory for the hardness rsa related the integer factorization problem while hellman and dsa are related the discrete logarithm problem more elliptic curve cryptography has developed which security based number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves because the difficulty the underlying most key algorithms involve operations such modular multiplication and which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used most block especially with typical key public key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems which fast quality key encryption algorithm used for the message while the relevant symmetric key sent with the but encrypted using key similarly hybrid signature schemes are often which cryptographic hash function and only the resulting hash digitally cryptanalysis cryptanalysis enigma machine world war cipher breaking and reading the enigma cipher cipher bureau bletchley park the goal cryptanalysis find some weakness insecurity cryptographic thus permitting its subversion common misconception that every encryption method can connection with his wwii work bell labs claude shannon proved that the one time pad cipher provided the key material truly random never kept secret from all possible and equal greater length than the most apart from the time can broken with enough computational effort brute force attack but the amount effort needed may exponentially dependent the key compared the effort needed make use the such effective security could achieved proven that the effort required work beyond the ability any this means must shown that efficient method opposed the consuming brute force can found break the since such proof has been found the pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable there are wide variety cryptanalytic and they can classified any several common distinction turns what attacker knows and what capabilities are ciphertext only attack the cryptanalyst has access only the ciphertext good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune only known plaintext attack the cryptanalyst has access ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext many such chosen plaintext attack the cryptanalyst may choose plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext perhaps many example gardening used the british during finally chosen ciphertext attack the cryptanalyst may able choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding also often overwhelmingly are mistakes generally the design use one the protocols involved see cryptanalysis the enigma for some historical examples pozna center germany cryptanalysis key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could against perfect for simple brute force attack against des requires one known plaintext and decryptions trying approximately half the possible reach point which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been but this may not enough linear cryptanalysis attack against des requires known plaintexts and approximately des this considerable improvement brute force public key algorithms are based the computational difficulty various the most famous these integer factorization the rsa algorithm based problem related integer but the discrete logarithm problem also much key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational some efficiently practical for the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic based version discrete logarithm are much more consuming than the best known algorithms for least for problems more less equivalent thus other things being achieve equivalent strength attack factoring based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve for this public key cryptosystems based elliptic curves have become popular since their invention the while pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses the algorithms other attacks cryptosystems are based actual use the algorithms real and are called side channel attacks cryptanalyst has access for the amount time the device took encrypt number plaintexts report error password pin may able use timing attack break cipher that otherwise resistant attacker might also study the pattern and length messages derive valuable this known traffic analysis and can quite useful alert poor administration such permitting too short will make any system regardless other and social engineering and other attacks against the personnel who work with cryptosystems the messages they handle bribery extortion blackmail espionage torture may the most productive attacks cryptographic primitives much the theoretical work cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives algorithms with basic cryptographic and their relationship other cryptographic more complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic these primitives provide fundamental which are used develop more complex tools called cryptosystems cryptographic protocols which guarantee one more level security note that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and quite for the rsa algorithm sometimes considered and sometimes typical examples cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions one way functions etc cryptosystems one more cryptographic primitives are often used develop more complex called cryptographic cryptosystem cryptosystems gamal encryption are designed provide particular functionality public key while guaranteeing certain security properties chosen plaintext attack security the random oracle model cryptosystems use the properties the underlying cryptographic primitives support the security the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems somewhat sophisticated cryptosystem can derived from combination several more primitive many the structure involves back and forth communication among two more parties space between the sender secure message and its across time cryptographically protected backup data such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols some widely known cryptosystems include rsa encryption schnorr signature gamal pgp etc more complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems signcryption systems etc some more cryptosystems include interactive proof systems like zero knowledge proofs systems for secret sharing etc until recently most security properties most cryptosystems were demonstrated using empirical using hoc recently there has been considerable effort develop formal techniques for establishing the security this has been generally called provable security the general idea provable security give arguments about the computational difficulty needed compromise some security aspect the cryptosystem any the study how best implement and integrate cryptography software applications itself distinct see cryptographic engineering and security engineering legal issues cryptography laws different nations prohibitions cryptography has long been interest intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies secret communications may criminal even treasonous because its facilitation privacy and the diminution privacy attendant its cryptography also considerable interest civil rights accordingly there has been history controversial legal issues surrounding especially since the advent inexpensive computers has made widespread access high quality cryptography some even the domestic use cryptography has restricted until france significantly restricted the use cryptography though has since relaxed many these china and iran license still required use many countries have tight restrictions the use among the more restrictive are laws belarus kazakhstan mongolia pakistan singapore tunisia and vietnam the united states cryptography legal for domestic but there has been much conflict over legal issues related one particularly important issue has been the export cryptography and cryptographic software and probably because the importance cryptanalysis world war and expectation that cryptography would continue important for national many western governments some strictly regulated export after world war was illegal the sell distribute encryption technology encryption was designated auxiliary military equipment and put the united states munitions list until the development the personal computer asymmetric key algorithms public key and the internet this was not especially however the internet grew and computers became more widely high quality encryption techniques became known around the export controls came seen impediment commerce and export controls export cryptography the there were several challenges export regulation after the source code for philip zimmermann pretty good privacy encryption program found its way onto the internet june complaint rsa security then called rsa data inc resulted lengthy criminal investigation zimmermann the customs service and the fbi though charges were ever daniel bernstein then graduate student berkeley brought lawsuit against the government challenging some aspects the restrictions based free speech grounds the case bernstein united states ultimately resulted decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected free speech the united states thirty nine countries signed the wassenaar arrangement arms control treaty that deals with the export arms and technologies such the treaty stipulated that the use cryptography with short lengths bit for symmetric bit for would longer cryptography exports from the became less strictly regulated consequence major relaxation there are longer very many restrictions key sizes exported mass market since this relaxation export and because most personal computers connected the internet include sourced web browsers such firefox internet explorer almost every internet user worldwide has potential access quality cryptography via their via transport layer security the mozilla thunderbird and microsoft outlook mail client programs similarly can transmit and received emails via and can send and receive email encrypted with mime many internet users realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems these browsers and email programs are ubiquitous that even governments whose intent regulate civilian use cryptography generally find practical much control distribution use cryptography this even when such laws are actual enforcement often effectively citation needed nsa involvement clipper chip another contentious issue connected cryptography the united states the influence the national security agency cipher development and the nsa was involved with the design des during its development ibm and its consideration the national bureau standards possible federal standard for des was designed resistant differential cryptanalysis powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known the nsa and that became publicly known only when was rediscovered the late according steven levy ibm discovered differential but kept the technique secret the the technique became publicly known only when biham and shamir discovered and announced some years the entire affair illustrates the difficulty determining what resources and knowledge attacker might actually another instance the involvement was the clipper chip affair encryption microchip intended part the capstone cryptography control clipper was widely criticized cryptographers for two the cipher algorithm called skipjack was then classified declassified long after the clipper initiative the classified cipher caused concerns that the nsa had deliberately made the cipher weak order assist its intelligence the whole initiative was also criticized based its violation kerckhoffs principle the scheme included special escrow key held the government for use law for example digital rights management digital rights management cryptography central digital rights management group techniques for technologically controlling use copyrighted material being widely implemented and deployed the behest some copyright american president bill clinton signed the digital millennium copyright act which criminalized all dissemination and use certain cryptanalytic techniques and
