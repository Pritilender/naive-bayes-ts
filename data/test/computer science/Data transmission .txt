exclusively informational has been sent via electronic optical acoustic mechanical means since the advent communication analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent the telephone however the first data electromagnetic transmission applications modern time were telegraphy and teletypewriters which are both digital signals the fundamental theoretical work data transmission and information theory harry nyquist ralph hartley claude shannon and others during the early was done with these applications data transmission utilized computers computer buses and for communication with peripheral equipment via parallel ports and serial ports such firewire and usb the principles data transmission are also utilized storage media for error detection and correction since data transmission utilized computer networking equipment such modems local area networks adapters repeaters hubs microwave links wireless network access points etc telephone digital communication utilized for transferring many phone calls over the same copper cable fiber cable means pulse code modulation sampling and combination with time division multiplexing telephone exchanges have become digital and software facilitating many value added for example the first axe telephone exchange was presented since the late digital communication the end user has been possible using integrated services digital network services since the end the broadband access techniques such adsl cable modems fiber building and fiber home have become widespread small offices and the current tendency replace traditional telecommunication services packet mode communication such telephony and iptv transmitting analog signals digitally allows for greater signal processing capability the ability process communications signal means that errors caused random processes can detected and digital signals can also sampled instead continuously the multiplexing multiple digital signals much simpler the multiplexing analog because all these and because recent advances wideband communication channels and solid state electronics have allowed scientists fully realize these digital communications has grown digital communications quickly edging out analog communication because the vast demand transmit computer data and the ability digital communications the digital revolution has also resulted many digital telecommunication applications where the principles data transmission are examples are second generation and later cellular telephony video conferencing digital digital radio telemetry etc baseband passband transmission the physically transmitted signal may one the baseband signal transmission sequence electrical pulses light pulses produced means line coding scheme such manchester coding this typically used serial cables wired local area networks such ethernet and optical fiber results pulse amplitude signal also known pulse train passband signal transmission modulated sine wave signal representing digital note that this some textbooks considered analog transmission but most books digital the signal produced means digital modulation method such psk qam fsk the modulation and demodulation carried out modem equipment this used wireless and over telephone network loop and serial and parallel transmission serial transmission the sequential transmission signal elements group representing character other entity data digital serial transmissions are bits sent over single frequency optical path because requires less signal processing and less chances for error than parallel the transfer rate each individual path may this can used over longer distances check digit parity bit can sent along parallel transmission the simultaneous transmission the signal elements character other entity digital communications parallel transmission the simultaneous transmission related signal elements over two more separate multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits which allows for higher data transfer rates than can achieved with serial this method used internally within the for example the internal and sometimes externally for such things the major issue with this skewing because the wires parallel data transmission have slightly different properties not some bits may arrive before which may corrupt the parity bit can help reduce however electrical wire parallel data transmission therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more types communication channels communication channel data transmission circuit simplex duplex duplex point drop bus network ring network star network mesh network wireless network asynchronous and synchronous data transmission comparison synchronous and asynchronous signalling this section may contain parts that are misleading please help clarify this article according any suggestions provided the talk page august asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits signify the beginning bit citation needed ascii character would actually transmitted using bits for would become the extra one depending parity bit the start and end the transmission tells the receiver first that character coming and secondly that the character has this method transmission used when data are sent intermittently opposed solid the previous example the start and stop bits are the start and stop bits must opposite citation needed this allows the receiver recognize when the second packet information being synchronous transmission uses start and stop but instead synchronizes transmission speeds both the receiving and sending end the transmission using clock signal built into each vague continual stream data then sent between the two due there being start and stop bits the data transfer rate quicker although more errors will the clocks will eventually get out and the receiving device would have the wrong time that had been agreed the protocol for receiving some bytes could become corrupted losing bits citation needed ways get around this problem include synchronization the clocks and use check digits ensure the byte correctly interpreted and received see also
