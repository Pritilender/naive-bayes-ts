intended algorithms underlying system with respect certain formal specification using formal methods mathematics formal verification can helpful proving the correctness systems such cryptographic protocols combinational circuits digital circuits with internal and software expressed source the verification these systems done providing formal proof abstract mathematical model the the correspondence between the mathematical model and the nature the system being otherwise known examples mathematical objects often used model systems finite state machines labelled transition systems petri nets timed automata hybrid automata process algebra formal semantics programming languages such operational semantics denotational semantics axiomatic semantics and hoare logic contents approaches formal verification formal verification for software verification and validation industry use see also references approaches formal verification one approach and formation model checking which consists systematically exhaustive exploration the mathematical model this possible for finite models but also for some infinite models where infinite sets states can effectively represented finitely using abstraction taking advantage usually this consists exploring all states and transitions the using smart and specific abstraction techniques consider whole groups states single operation and reduce computing implementation techniques include state space enumeration symbolic state space abstract interpretation symbolic simulation abstraction refinement the properties verified are often described temporal logics such linear temporal logic computational tree logic the great advantage model checking that often fully its primary disadvantage that does not general scale large symbolic models are typically limited few hundred bits while explicit state enumeration requires the state space being explored relatively another approach deductive consists generating from the system and its specifications and possibly other collection mathematical proof obligations the truth which imply conformance the system its and discharging these obligations using either interactive theorem provers such hol acl isabelle coq automatic theorem satisfiability modulo theories solvers this approach has the disadvantage that typically requires the user understand detail why the system works and convey this information the verification either the form sequence theorems proved the form specifications system components functions and perhaps subcomponents such loops data formal verification for software logical inference for the formal verification software can further divided the more traditional approach which code first written the usual and subsequently proven correct separate dependently typed programming which the types functions include least part those specifications and checking the code establishes its correctness against those fully featured dependently typed languages support the first approach special slightly different and approach program derivation which efficient code produced from functional specifications series preserving example this approach the bird meertens formalism and this approach can seen another form correctness construction verification and validation verification and validation verification one aspect testing fitness for validation the complementary often one refers the overall checking process validation are trying make the right the product specified the actual verification have made what were trying does the product conform the the verification process consists structural and behavioral for software product one can inspect the source code and run against specific test cases validation usually can done only the product tested putting through typical and atypical usages does satisfactorily meet all use cases industry use the growth complexity designs increases the importance formal verification techniques the hardware industry formal verification used most all citation needed leading hardware but its use the software industry still citation needed this could attributed the greater need the hardware where errors have greater commercial citation needed because the potential subtle interactions between increasingly difficult exercise realistic set possibilities important aspects hardware design are
