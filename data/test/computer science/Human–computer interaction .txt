computers they use crucial facilitating this desktop internet handheld and computer kiosks make use the prevalent graphical user interfaces voice user interfaces are used for speech recognition and synthesising and the emerging modal and gestalt user interfaces allow humans engage with embodied character agents way that cannot achieved with other interface according junny manglib human computer interaction the planning and design the interaction between people and often regarded the intersection computer behavioral design and several other fields interaction between users and computers occurs the user interface simply which includes both software and for characters objects displayed software personal input received from users via hardware peripherals such keyboards and and other user interactions with scale computerized systems such aircraft and power the association for computing machinery defines computer interaction discipline concerned with the evaluation and implementation interactive computing systems for human use and with the study major phenomena surrounding important facet hci the securing user satisfaction simply end user computing because computer interaction studies human and machine draws from supporting knowledge both the machine and the human the machine techniques computer graphics operating systems programming languages and development environments are the human communication theory graphic and industrial design disciplines linguistics social sciences cognitive psychology social psychology and human factors such computer user satisfaction are and engineering and design methods are due the multidisciplinary nature people with different backgrounds contribute its hci also sometimes referred human machine interaction hmi man machine interaction mmi computer human interaction chi poorly designed human machine interfaces can lead many unexpected classic example this the three mile island accident nuclear meltdown where investigations concluded that the design the machine interface was least partially responsible for the similarly accidents aviation have resulted from decisions use standard flight instrument throttle

supported cooperative work emphasis placed the use computing systems support the collaborative work group the principles human interaction management extend the scope cscw organizational level and can implemented without use design principles input output displays graphical user interface input and output latency workflow when evaluating current user interface designing new user important keep mind the following experimental design early focus and establish how many users are needed perform the and determine who the appropriate users should someone who has never used the and will not use the interface the most likely not valid define the the users will performing and how often the need empirical measurement test the interface early with real users who come contact with the interface daily keep mind that results may vary with the performance level the user and may not accurate depiction the typical computer establish quantitative usability specifics such the number users performing the the time complete the and the number errors made during the iterative design after determining the tasks and empirical measurements perform the following iterative design design the user interface test analyze results repeat repeat the iterative design process until user friendly interface methodologies number diverse methodologies outlining techniques for computer interaction design have emerged since the rise the field the most design methodologies stem from model for how designers and technical systems early for treated cognitive processes predictable and quantifiable and encouraged design practitioners look cognitive science results areas such memory and attention when designing user modern models tend focus constant feedback and conversation between designers and engineers and push for technical systems wrapped around the types experiences users want rather than wrapping user experience around completed activity theory used hci define and study the context which human interactions with computers take activity theory provides framework reason about actions these analytical tools with the format checklists items that researchers should and informs design interactions from centric user centered design user centered design widely practiced design philosophy rooted the idea that users must take stage the design any computer users designers and technical practitioners work together articulate the needs and limitations the user and create system that addresses these often user centered design projects are informed ethnographic studies the environments which users will interacting with the this practice similar but not identical participatory design which emphasizes the possibility for users contribute actively through shared design sessions and principles user interface design these are seven principles user interface design that may considered any time during the design user interface any tolerance simplicity visibility affordance consistency structure and value sensitive design value sensitive design method for building technology that account for the values the people who use the technology well those who the technology either directly vsd uses iterative design process that involves three types conceptual empirical and conceptual investigations aim understanding and articulating the various stakeholders the well their values and any values conflicts that might arise for these stakeholders through the use the empirical investigations are qualitative quantitative design research studies used inform the understanding the values needs and technical investigations can involve either analysis how people use related the design systems support values identified the conceptual and empirical display designs displays are made artifacts designed support the perception relevant system variables and facilitate further processing that before display the task that the display intended support must defined navigating controlling decision learning entertaining etc user operator must able process whatever information that system generates and therefore the information must displayed according principles manner that will support situation and thirteen principles display design christopher wickens defined principles display design their book introduction human factors engineering these principles human perception and information processing can utilized create effective display reduction reduction required training increase and increase user satisfaction are few the many potential benefits that can achieved through utilization these certain principles may not applicable different displays some principles may seem and there simple solution say that one principle more important than the principles may tailored specific design striking functional balance among the principles critical for effective perceptual principles make displays legible legibility critical and necessary for designing usable the characters objects being displayed cannot then the operator cannot effectively make use avoid absolute judgment limits not ask the user determine the level variable the basis single sensory variable color size loudness these sensory variables can contain many possible top down processing signals are likely perceived and interpreted accordance with what expected based past signal presented contrary the more physical evidence that signal may need presented assure that understood redundancy gain signal presented more than more likely that will understood this can done presenting the signal alternative physical forms color and voice and etc redundancy does not imply traffic light good example color and position are similarity causes use discriminable elements signals that appear similar will likely the ratio similar features different features causes signals for more similar than unnecessary similar features should removed and dissimilar features should mental model principles principle pictorial realism display should look like the variable that represents high temperature thermometer shown higher vertical there are multiple they can configured manner that looks like would the represented principle the moving part moving elements should move pattern and direction compatible with the mental model how actually moves the for the moving element altimeter should move upward with increasing principles based attention minimizing information access cost when the attention diverted from one location another access necessary there associated cost time display design should minimize this cost allowing for frequently accessed sources located the nearest possible however adequate legibility should not sacrificed reduce this proximity compatibility principle divided attention between two information sources may necessary for the completion one these sources must mentally integrated and are defined have close mental information access costs should which can achieved many ways proximity linkage common patterns shapes etc however close display proximity can harmful causing too much principle multiple resources user can more easily process information across different for visual and auditory information can presented simultaneously rather than presenting all visual all auditory memory principles replace memory with visual knowledge the world user should not need retain important information solely working memory retrieve from term checklist another display can aid the user easing the use their however the use memory may sometimes benefit the user eliminating the need reference some type knowledge the world expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer the use knowledge head and knowledge the world must balanced for effective principle predictive aiding proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive display should attempt eliminate demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks reduce the use the mental this will allow the user not only focus current but also think about possible future example predictive aid road sign displaying the distance certain principle consistency old habits from other displays will easily transfer support processing new displays they are designed consistent term memory will trigger actions that are expected design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different human computer interface user interface the computer interface can described the point communication between the human user and the the flow
