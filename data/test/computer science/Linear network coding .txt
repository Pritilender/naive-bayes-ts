linear network coding network coding navigation search linear network coding technique which can used improve efficiency and scalability well resilience attacks and instead simply relaying the packets information they the nodes network take several packets and combine them together for this can used attain the maximum possible information flow network has been proven that linear coding enough achieve the upper bound multicast problems with one more however linear coding not sufficient general multisource multisink with arbitrary even for more general versions linearity such convolutional coding and filter bank coding finding optimal coding solutions for general network problems with arbitrary demands remains open contents encoding and decoding brief history the butterfly network example random network coding issues random network coding wireless network coding applications see also references external links encoding and decoding linear network coding group nodes are involved moving the data from source nodes sink each node generates new packets which are linear combinations earlier received multiplying them coefficients chosen from finite field typically size each with indegree generates message from the linear combination received messages the where the values are the coefficients selected from note since operations are computed finite the generated message the same length the original each node forwards the computed value along with the used the level sink nodes receive these network coded and collect them the original messages can recovered performing gaussian elimination the citation needed reduced row echelon decoded packets correspond the rows the form brief history network represented directed graph the set nodes the set directed links and gives the capacity each link let the maximum possible throughput from node node the max flow cut theorem upper bounded the minimum capacity all cuts which the sum the capacities the edges between these two karl menger proved that there always set disjoint paths achieving the upper bound unicast scenario known the max flow cut theorem later the ford fulkerson algorithm was proposed find such paths polynomial then edmonds proved the paper disjoint the upper bound the broadcast scenario also and proposed polynomial time however the situation the multicast scenario more and such upper bound reached using traditional routing ideas ahlswede proved that can achieved additional computing tasks incoming packets are combined into one several outgoing can done the intermediate the butterfly network example the butterfly network often used illustrate how linear network coding can outperform routing two source nodes the top the have information and that must transmitted the two destination nodes the which each want know both and each edge can carry only single value can think edge transmitting bit each time only routing were then the central link would only able carry but not suppose send through the then the left destination would receive twice and not know sending poses similar problem for the right say that routing insufficient because routing scheme can transmit both and simultaneously both using simple and can transmitted both destinations simultaneously sending the sum the symbols through the other encode and using the formula the left destination receives and and can calculate subtracting the two similarly the right destination will receive and and will also able determine both and random network coding random network coding simple yet powerful encoding which broadcast transmission schemes allows close optimal throughput using decentralized nodes transmit random linear combinations the packets they with coefficients chosen from galois the field size sufficiently the probability that the will obtain linearly independent combinations and therefore obtain innovative approaches should however noted although random network coding has excellent throughput receiver obtains insufficient number extremely unlikely that they can recover any the original this can addressed sending additional random linear combinations until the receiver obtains the appropriate number issues random network coding based previous there are three important open issues high decoding computational complexity due using the jordan elimination method high transmission overhead due attaching large coefficients vectors encoded blocks linear dependency among coefficients vectors which can reduce the number innovative encoded blocks behrang barekatain addressed these open therefore rnc can more useful for computer especially wireless wireless network coding the broadcast nature wireless coupled with network determines the nature interference simultaneous transmissions wireless network typically result all the packets being lost collision see multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless wireless network therefore requires scheduler part the mac functionality minimize such hence any gains from network coding are strongly impacted the underlying scheduler and will deviate from the gains seen wired further wireless links are typically duplex due hardware node can not simultaneously transmit and receive due the lack sufficient isolation between the two although originally network coding was proposed used network layer see osi model wireless network coding has been widely used either mac layer phy layer has been shown than both network coding can increase the end applications network coding seen useful the following
