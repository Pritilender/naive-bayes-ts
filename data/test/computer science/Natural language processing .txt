processing the history nlp generally starts the although work can found from earlier alan turing published article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what now called the turing test criterion the georgetown experiment involved fully automatic translation more than sixty russian sentences into the authors claimed that within three five machine translation would solved however real progress was much and after the alpac report which found that ten year long research had failed fulfill the funding for machine translation was dramatically little further research machine translation was conducted until the late when the first statistical machine translation systems were some notably successful nlp systems developed the were shrdlu natural language system working

structured world information into understandable examples are margie sam pam talespin qualm politics and plot units lehnert during this many chatterbots were written including parry racter and jabberwacky the most nlp systems were based complex sets written starting the late however there was revolution nlp with the introduction machine learning algorithms for language this was due both the steady increase computational power resulting from moore law and the gradual lessening the dominance chomskyan theories linguistics transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort corpus linguistics that underlies the learning approach language some the used machine learning such decision trees produced systems hard then rules similar existing written increasingly however research has focused statistical models which make probabilistic decisions based attaching real valued weights the features making the input the cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples such statistical such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar especially input that contains errors very common for world and produce more reliable results when integrated into larger system comprising multiple many the notable early successes occurred the field machine translation due especially work ibm where successively more complicated statistical models were these systems were able take advantage existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced the parliament canada and the european union result laws calling for the translation all governmental proceedings into all official languages the corresponding systems however most other systems depended corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented these which was and often continues major limitation the success these great deal research has gone into methods more effectively learning from limited amounts recent research has increasingly focused unsupervised and semi supervised learning such algorithms are able learn from data that has not been annotated with the desired using combination annotated and annotated generally this task much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for given amount input however there enormous amount annotated data available among other the entire content the world

language prior implementations processing tasks typically involved the direct hand coding large sets the learning paradigm calls instead for using general learning often although not grounded statistical inference automatically learn such rules through the analysis large corpora typical world corpus corpora set documents individual that have been annotated with the correct values many different classes machine learning algorithms have been applied nlp these algorithms take input large set features that are generated from the input some the used such decision trees produced systems hard then rules similar the systems written rules that were then increasingly however research has focused statistical models which make probabilistic decisions based attaching real valued weights each input such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty many different possible answers rather than only producing more reliable results when such model included component larger systems based learning algorithms have many advantages over produced the learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus the most common whereas when writing rules hand often not obvious all where the effort should automatic learning procedures can make use statistical inference algorithms produce models that are robust unfamiliar input containing words structures that have not been seen and erroneous input with misspelled words words accidentally generally handling such input gracefully with written more creating systems written rules that make soft extremely error prone and systems based automatically learning the rules can made more accurate simply supplying more input however systems based written rules can only made more accurate increasing the complexity the which much more difficult there limit the complexity systems based crafted beyond which the systems become more and more however creating more data input learning systems simply requires corresponding increase the number hours generally without significant increases the complexity the annotation the subfield nlp devoted learning approaches known natural language learning and

evaluation which includes mainly evaluation data and evaluation enables several teams compare their solutions given nlp short history evaluation nlp the first evaluation campaign written texts seems campaign dedicated message understanding pallet then the geig project compared structure grammars black series campaigns within tipster project were realized tasks like translation and searching hirschman the morpholympics compared german then the senseval romanseval campaigns were conducted with the objectives semantic the sparkle campaign compared syntactic parsers four different languages french german and the grace project compared set taggers for french adda during the technolangue easy project parsers for french were large scale evaluation dependency parsers were performed the context the conll shared tasks and the evalita campaign was conducted and compare various nlp and speech tools for the campaign full progress evalita web site within the passage project end parsers for french were compared passage web site different types evaluation depending the evaluation number distinctions are traditionally made nlp intrinsic extrinsic evaluation intrinsic evaluation considers isolated nlp system and characterizes its performance mainly with respect gold standard result pre defined the extrinsic also called evaluation use considers the nlp system more complex either embedded system serving precise function for human the extrinsic performance the system then characterized terms its utility with respect the overall task the complex system the human for consider syntactic parser that based the output some new part speech tagger intrinsic evaluation would run the pos tagger some labelled and compare the system output the pos tagger the gold standard output extrinsic evaluation would run the parser with some other pos and then with the new pos and compare the parsing black box glass box evaluation box evaluation requires one run nlp system given data set and measure number parameters related the quality the process reliability resource and most the quality the result the accuracy data annotation the fidelity glass box evaluation looks the design the the algorithms that are the linguistic resources uses vocabulary etc given the complexity nlp often difficult predict performance only the basis box but this type evaluation more informative with respect error analysis future developments automatic manual evaluation many automatic procedures can defined evaluate nlp system comparing its output with the gold standard one although the cost producing the gold standard can quite automatic evaluation can repeated often needed without much additional costs the same input however for many nlp the definition gold standard complex and can prove impossible when annotator agreement manual evaluation performed human which are instructed estimate the quality most often sample its based number although thanks their linguistic human judges can considered the reference for number language processing there also considerable variation across their this why automatic evaluation sometimes referred objective evaluation
