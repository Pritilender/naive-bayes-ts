neutrality this section disputed relevant discussion may found the talk page please not remove this message until the dispute resolved january object oriented programming approach designing reusable software although discussions oriented technology can get trapped the details one language the the real key the oriented approach that modelling approach the oriented approach considered logical extension good design practices that back the very beginning computer programming rather than being revolutionary claimed some object orientation simply the logical extension older techniques such structured programming and abstract data types object abstract data type with the addition polymorphism and inheritance rather than structure programs code and oriented system integrates the two using the concept object object has state and behavior objects correspond things found the real for graphics program will have objects such circle square menu online shopping system will have objects such shopping cart customer product the shopping system will support behaviors such place order make payment and offer discount the objects are designed class for with the shopping system there might high level classes such electronics product kitchen product and book there may further refinements for example under electronic products dvd player etc these classes and subclasses correspond sets and subsets mathematical the goals oriented programming increased ease ease the overall understanding the system increased because the semantic the distance between the language spoken developers and that spoken rather than talking about database tables and programming the developer talks about things the user familiar objects from their application object orientation eases maintenance the use encapsulation and information hiding one the most common sources errors programs when one part the system accidentally interferes with another for the very earliest days was common for developers use statements jump arbitrary locations within only few routines and critics called this spaghetti because structured programming addresses this encouraging the use procedures and appropriate usage sections off responsibility for individual blocks implement separate for one would know that the square root function was separate from the launch missiles function and change one could not affect the object orientation takes this the next essentially merges abstract data types with structured programming and divides systems into modular objects which own their own data and are responsible for their own this feature known with not only can the square and launch functions not interfere with each but also the data for the two are divided that changes one object cannot affect the note that all this relies the various languages being used which never object orientation not software silver bullet addition providing ease encapsulation and information hiding provide ease evolution defining software modular components that support inheritance makes easy both use existing components and extend components needed defining new subclasses with specialized this goal being easy both maintain and reuse known the oriented paradigm the open closed module open supports extension can easily modify add new provide default etc module closed has well defined stable interface that all other modules must use and that limits the interaction and potential errors that can introduced into one module changes the oriented approach encourages the programmer place data where not directly accessible the rest the instead the data accessed calling specially written called methods which are bundled with the these act the intermediaries for retrieving modifying the data they the programming construct that combines data with set methods for accessing and managing that data called the practice using subroutines examine modify certain kinds data was also used oop modular programming well before the widespread use oriented oriented program usually contains different types each corresponding world object concept such bank hockey program might contain multiple copies each type one for each the world objects the program deals for there could one bank account object for each world account particular each copy the bank account object would alike the methods offers for manipulating reading its but the data inside each object would reflecting the different history each objects can thought encapsulating their data within set functions designed ensure that the data used and assist that the methods typically include checks and safeguards specific the data types the object object can also offer standardized methods for performing particular operations its while concealing the specifics how those tasks are this alterations can made the internal structure methods object without requiring that the rest the program this approach can also used offer standardized methods across different types several different types objects might offer print each type object might implement that print method different reflecting the different kinds data each but all the different print methods might called the same standardized manner from elsewhere the these features become especially useful when more than one programmer contributing code project when the goal reuse code between history terminology invoking objects and oriented the modern sense oriented programming made its first appearance mit the late and early the environment the artificial intelligence group early object could refer identified items lisp atoms with properties alan kay was later cite detailed understanding lisp internals strong influence his thinking another early mit example was sketchpad created ivan sutherland the glossary the technical report based his dissertation about sutherland defined notions object and instance with the class concept covered master definition albeit specialized graphical also mit algol version aed linked data structures plexes that directly with prefiguring what were later termed messages methods and member the formal programming concept objects was introduced the simula major revision simula programming language designed for discrete event simulation created ole johan dahl and kristen nygaard the norwegian computing center oslo simula was influenced simscript and tony hoare proposed record simula introduced the notion classes and instances objects well virtual coroutines and discrete event part explicit programming the language also used automatic garbage collection that had been invented earlier for the functional programming language lisp simula was used for physical such models study and improve the movement ships and their content through cargo the ideas simula influenced many later including derivatives lisp clos object pascal and the smalltalk language which was developed xerox parc alan kay and the introduced the term object oriented programming represent the pervasive use objects and messages the basis for smalltalk creators were influenced the ideas introduced simula but smalltalk was designed fully dynamic system which classes could created and modified dynamically rather than statically simula smalltalk and with oop were introduced wider audience the august issue byte magazine the kay smalltalk work had influenced the lisp community incorporate object based techniques that were introduced developers via the lisp machine experimentation with various extensions lisp such loops and flavors introducing multiple inheritance and mixins eventually led the common lisp object system which integrates functional programming and oriented programming and allows extension via meta object protocol the there were few attempts design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects memory but these were not examples include the intel iapx and the linn smart rekursiv bertrand meyer produced the first design the eiffel language focused software eiffel among the purely oriented but differs the sense that the language itself not only programming but notation supporting the entire software meyer described the eiffel software development based small number key ideas from software engineering and computer object oriented software construction essential the quality focus eiffel reliability design contract which integral part both the method and object oriented programming developed the dominant programming methodology the early and mid when programming languages supporting the techniques became widely these included visual foxpro citation needed and delphi citation needed its dominance was further enhanced the rising popularity graphical user interfaces which rely heavily upon oriented programming example closely related dynamic gui library and oop language can found the cocoa frameworks mac written objective dynamic messaging extension based oop toolkits also enhanced the popularity event driven programming although this concept not limited some feel that association with guis real was what propelled oop into the programming eth rich niklaus wirth and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics data abstraction and modular programming although this had been common use the modula included and their succeeding oberon included distinctive approach object classes and the approach unlike smalltalk and very unlike object oriented features have been added many previously existing including ada basic fortran pascal and cobol adding these features languages that were not initially designed for them often led problems with compatibility and maintainability more number languages have emerged that are primarily but that are also compatible with procedural two such languages are python and ruby probably the most important recent oriented languages are visual net and both designed for net platform and java developed sun microsystems each these two frameworks its own the benefit using oop creating abstraction from net and support language allowing classes defined one language subclass classes defined the other developers usually compile java bytecode allowing java run any operating system for which java virtual machine net and make use the strategy pattern accomplish language whereas java makes use the adapter pattern citation needed just procedural programming led refinements techniques such structured programming modern oriented software design methods include refinements citation needed such the use design patterns design contract and modeling languages such uml fundamental features and concepts list oriented programming terms survey deborah armstrong nearly years computing literature identified number fundamental found the large majority definitions not all these concepts appear all oriented programming for object oriented programming that uses classes sometimes called class based programming while prototype based programming does not typically use significantly different yet analogous terminology used define the concepts object and instance benjamin pierce and some other researchers view any attempt distill oop minimal set features nonetheless identifies fundamental features that support the oop programming style most oriented dynamic dispatch when method invoked the object itself determines what code gets executed looking the method run time table associated with the this feature distinguishes object from abstract data type which has fixed implementation the operations for all programming methodology that gives modular component development while the same time being very encapsulation multi methods which case the state kept subtype polymorphism object inheritance delegation open recursion special variable syntactically may usually called that allows method body invoke another method body the same this variable late bound allows method defined one class invoke another method that defined some subclass similarly his book concepts programming languages john mitchell identifies four main dynamic abstraction subtype and michael lee scott programming language pragmatics considers only inheritance and dynamic additional concepts used oriented programming classes objects instances classes methods which act the attached message passing abstraction decoupling decoupling refers careful controls that separate code modules from particular use which increases code common use decoupling polymorphically decouple the encapsulation see bridge pattern and adapter pattern for using method interface that encapsulated object must opposed using the additional features formal semantics formal semantics programming languages objects are the time entities oriented they may represent bank table any item that the program has there have been several attempts formalizing the concepts used oriented the following concepts and constructs have been used interpretations oop algebraic data types abstract data types which have existential types allow the definition modules but these not support dynamic dispatch recursive types encapsulated state inheritance records are basis for understanding objects function literals can stored fields like functional programming but the actual calculi need considerably more complex incorporate essential features several extensions system that deal with mutable objects have been these allow both subtype polymorphism and parametric polymorphism attempts find consensus definition theory behind objects have not proven very successful see abadi cardelli theory objects for formal definitions many oop concepts and and often diverge for some definitions focus mental and some program one the simpler definitions that oop the act using map data structures arrays that can contain functions and pointers other all with some syntactic and scoping sugar inheritance can performed cloning the maps sometimes called prototyping oop languages this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed august list oriented programming languages simula generally accepted the first language with the primary features oriented was created for making simulation programs which what came called objects were the most important information smalltalk arguably the canonical and the one with which much the theory oriented programming was concerning the degree object the following distinctions can languages called pure because everything them treated consistently from primitives such characters and all the way whole prototypes blocks modules etc they were designed specifically even examples eiffel emerald jade obix ruby scala smalltalk self languages designed mainly for but with some procedural examples delphi object pascal java net python languages that are historically procedural languages but have been extended with some examples pascal visual basic derived from matlab fortran perl cobol php abap ada languages with most the features objects methods inheritance but distinctly original examples oberon languages with abstract data type support but not all features sometimes called object based languages examples modula pliant clu chameleon languages that support multiple including tcl stands out among these for hybrid object system that supports both prototype based programming and based oop dynamic languages recent object oriented programming has become especially popular dynamic programming languages python ruby and groovy are dynamic languages built oop while perl and php have been adding oriented features since perl and php and coldfusion since version the document object model html xhtml and xml documents the internet has bindings the popular javascript ecmascript language javascript perhaps the best known prototype based programming language which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from class contrast class based programming another scripting language that takes this approach lua before actionscript partial superset the otherwise known only based object model was design patterns challenges oriented design are addressed several most common known the design patterns codified gamma more the term design patterns can used refer any repeatable solution commonly occurring problem software some these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular oriented inheritance and behavioral subtyping object oriented design intuitive assume that inheritance creates semantic relationship and thus infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always safely used instead those instantiated from the this intuition unfortunately false most oop particular all those that allow mutable objects subtype polymorphism enforced the type checker oop languages with mutable cannot guarantee behavioral subtyping any behavioral subtyping undecidable cannot implemented program class object hierarchies must carefully considering possible incorrect uses that cannot detected this issue known the liskov substitution principle gang four design patterns design pattern computer design elements reusable oriented software influential book published erich gamma richard helm ralph johnson and john vlissides often referred humorously the gang along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls oriented describes common programming problems and patterns for solving april the book was its the book describes the following creational patterns factory method pattern abstract factory pattern singleton pattern builder pattern prototype pattern structural patterns adapter pattern bridge pattern composite pattern decorator pattern facade pattern flyweight pattern proxy pattern behavioral patterns chain responsibility pattern command pattern interpreter pattern iterator pattern mediator pattern memento pattern observer pattern state pattern strategy pattern template method pattern visitor pattern orientation and databases object relational impedance mismatch relational mapping object database both oriented programming and relational database management systems are extremely common software today since relational databases don store objects directly though some rdbmss have oriented features approximate there general need bridge the two the problem bridging oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases known object relational impedance mismatch there are number approaches cope with this but general solution without one the most common approaches object relational mapping found libraries like java data objects and ruby rails activerecord there are also object databases that can used replace but these have not been technically and commercially successful real world modeling and relationships oop can used associate world objects and processes with digital however not everyone agrees that oop facilitates direct world mapping see criticism section that world mapping even worthy bertrand meyer argues object oriented software construction that program not model the world but model some part the reality cousin twice the same some principal limitations oop had been for the circle ellipse problem difficult handle using concept inheritance however niklaus wirth who popularized the adage now known wirth law software getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes said oop his good ideas through the looking this paradigm closely reflects the structure systems the real and therefore well suited model complex systems with complex contrast kiss principle steve yegge and others noted that natural languages lack the oop approach strictly prioritizing things nouns before actions verbs this problem may cause oop suffer more convoluted solutions than procedural oop and control flow oop was developed increase the reusability and maintainability source transparent representation the control flow had priority and was meant handled with the increasing relevance parallel hardware and multithreaded coding developing transparent control flow becomes more something hard achieve with responsibility data driven design responsibility driven design defines classes terms that class should defined around responsibility and the information that this contrasted brock and wilkerson with data driven design where classes are defined around the structures that must the authors hold that driven design criticism the oop paradigm has been criticised for number including not meeting its stated goals reusability and and for overemphasizing one aspect software design and modeling the expense other important aspects luca cardelli has claimed that oop code intrinsically less than procedural that oop can take longer and that oop languages have extremely poor modularity properties with respect class extension and and tend extremely the latter point reiterated joe armstrong the principal inventor erlang who quoted saying the problem with oriented languages got all this implicit environment that they carry around with you wanted banana but what you got was gorilla holding the banana and the entire study potok has shown significant difference productivity between oop and procedural christopher date stated that critical comparison oop other relational difficult because lack upon and rigorous definition however date and darwen have proposed theoretical foundation oop that uses oop kind customizable type system support rdbms alexander stepanov compares object orientation unfavourably multimethods find oop technically attempts decompose the world terms interfaces that vary single deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras families interfaces that span multiple find oop philosophically claims that everything even true not very interesting saying that everything object saying nothing paul graham has suggested that popularity within large companies due large and frequently groups mediocre according the discipline imposed oop prevents any one programmer from doing too much steve yegge noted opposed functional programming object oriented programming puts the nouns first and why would you such lengths put one part speech why should one kind concept take precedence over not oop has suddenly made verbs less important the way actually strangely skewed rich hickey creator clojure described object systems overly simplistic models the real
