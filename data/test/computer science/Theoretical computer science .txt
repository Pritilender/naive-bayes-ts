easy circumscribe the theory areas precisely and the acm special interest group algorithms and computation theory describes its mission the promotion theoretical computer science and the field theoretical computer science interpreted broadly include algorithms data structures computational complexity theory distributed computation parallel computation vlsi machine learning computational biology computational geometry information theory cryptography quantum computation computational number theory and algebra program semantics and verification automata theory and the study randomness work this field often distinguished its emphasis mathematical technique and rigor this the journal transactions computation theory adds coding theory computational learning theory and theoretical computer science aspects areas such databases information retrieval economic models and networks despite this broad the theory computer science identify different from the applied some characterize themselves doing the more underlying the field other applied suggest that impossible separate theory and this the called theory regularly use experimental done theoretical areas such software system research this also there more cooperation than mutually exclusive competition between theory and mathematical logic automata theory number theory graph theory computability theory computational complexity theory terces cryptography type theory category theory computational geometry quantum computing theory history history computer science while formal algorithms have existed for millennia euclid algorithm for determining the greatest common divisor two numbers still used was not until that alan turing alonzo church and stephen kleene formalized the definition algorithm terms while binary and logical systems mathematics had existed before when gottfried leibniz formalized logic with binary values for true and false while logical inference and mathematical proof had existed ancient kurt del proved with his incompleteness theorem that there were fundamental limitations what statements could proved these developments have led the modern study logic and computability and indeed the field theoretical computer science information theory was added the field with mathematical theory communication claude shannon the same donald hebb introduced mathematical model learning the with mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some the fields neural networks and parallel distributed processing were stephen cook and working leonid levin proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are complete landmark result computational complexity theory with the development quantum mechanics the beginning the century came the concept that mathematical operations could performed entire particle other one could compute functions multiple states this led the concept quantum computer the latter half the century that took off the when peter shor showed that such methods could used factor large numbers polynomial time which would render most modern public key cryptography systems uselessly modern theoretical computer science research based these
