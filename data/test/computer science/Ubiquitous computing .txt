ubiquitous computing navigation search ubiquitous computing ubicomp concept software engineering and computer science where computing made appear everywhere and contrast desktop ubiquitous computing can occur using any any and any user interacts with the which can exist many different including laptop tablets and terminals everyday objects such fridge pair glasses the underlying technologies support ubiquitous computing include advanced middleware operating system mobile code sensors microprocessors new and user networks mobile location and positioning and new materials this new paradigm also described pervasive computing ambient intelligence each term emphasizes slightly different when primarily concerning the objects also known physical computing the internet things haptic computing and things that rather than propose single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related taxonomy properties for ubiquitous computing has been from which different kinds flavors ubiquitous

interface contemporary computer interaction whether command line menu gui are inappropriate and inadequate the ubiquitous this suggests that the natural interaction paradigm appropriate fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet emerge although there also recognition the field that many ways are already living ubicomp world see also the main article natural user interface contemporary devices that lend some support this latter idea include mobile phones digital audio players radio frequency identification tags gps and interactive whiteboards mark weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system see also smart device tabs pads and tabs wearable centimetre sized devices pads hand held sized devices boards metre sized interactive display these three forms proposed weiser are characterized being having planar form and incorporating visual output relax each these three characteristics can expand this range into much more diverse and potentially more useful range ubiquitous computing hence three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been dust miniaturized devices can without visual output micro mechanical systems mems ranging from nanometres through micrometers see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive organic computer can formed into more flexible planar display surfaces and products such clothes and see oled display mems device can also painted onto various surfaces that variety physical world structures can act networked surfaces clay ensembles mems can formed into arbitrary three dimensional shapes artefacts resembling many different kinds physical object see also tangible interface his book the rise the network society manuel castells suggests that there ongoing shift from stand alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive his model pervasive computing castells uses the example the internet the start pervasive computing the logical progression from that paradigm system where that networking logic becomes applicable every realm daily every location and every castells envisages system where billions ubiquitous communication devices will spread like pigment the wall ubiquitous computing may seen consist many each with their own which together form single layer task management layer monitors user context and index map task need for the services the environment manage complex

reliability the resources history mark weiser coined the phrase ubiquitous around during his tenure chief technologist the xerox palo alto research center both alone and with parc director and chief scientist john seely brown weiser wrote some the earliest papers the largely defining and sketching out its major recognizing that the extension processing power into everyday scenarios would necessitate understandings cultural and psychological phenomena beyond its proper weiser was influenced many fields outside computer including philosophy phenomenology anthropology psychology post modernism sociology science and feminist criticism was explicit about the humanistic origins the invisible ideal modernist referencing well the ironically dystopian philip dick novel ubik andy hopper from cambridge university proposed and demonstrated the concept teleporting where applications follow the user wherever she roy while researcher and student working under andy hopper cambridge worked the active badge which advanced location computing system where personal mobility that merged with bill schilit now also did some earlier work this and participated the early mobile computing workshop held santa cruz ken sakamura the university tokyo japan leads the ubiquitous networking laboratory tokyo well the engine forum the joint goal ubiquitous networking specification and the engine enable
