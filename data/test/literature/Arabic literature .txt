from this period either filled with snippets poetry the form saj rhymed the themes the poetry range from flown hymns praise bitter personal attacks and from religious and mystical ideas poems sex and important feature the poetry which would applied all the literature was the idea that must pleasing the the poetry and much the prose was written with the design that would spoken aloud and great care was taken make all writing mellifluous non fiction literature compilations and manuals the late century ibn nadim baghdadi bookseller compiled crucial work the study arabic kitab fihrist catalogue all books available for sale baghdad and gives overview the state the literature that one the most common forms literature during the abbasid period was the these were collections ideas instructive stories and poems single topic and covers subjects diverse house and women gate blind envy animals and these last three compilations were written jahiz the acknowledged master the these collections were important for any nadim companion ruler noble whose role was often involved regaling the ruler with stories and information entertain type work closely allied the collection was the manual which writers like ibn qutaybah offered instruction subjects like how how bureaucrat and even how ibn qutaybah also wrote one the earliest histories the drawing together biblical arabic folk tales and more historical the subject sex was frequently investigated arabic the ghazal love poem had long history being times tender and chaste and other times rather the sufi tradition the love poem would take mystical and religious sex manuals were also written such the perfumed garden awq mah the neckring ibn hazm and nuzhat albab yujad kitab delight hearts concerning what will never found book ahmad tifashi countering such works are one like rawdat muhibbin nuzhat mushtaqin meadow lovers and diversion the infatuated ibn qayyim jawziyyah who advises how separate love and lust and avoid biography history and geography aside from the early biographies the first major biographer weigh character rather than just producing hymn praise was the persian scholar baladhuri with his kitab ansab ashraf book the genealogies the noble collection another important biographical dictionary was begun ibn khallikan and expanded safadi and one the first significant autobiographies was kitab tibar which told

postal service wrote one the first travel books and the form remained popular one arabic literature with books ibn hawqal ibn fadlan muqaddasi idrisi and most famously the travels ibn battutah these give view the many cultures the wider islamic world and also offer muslim perspectives the muslim peoples the edges the they also indicated just how great trading power the muslim peoples had these were often sprawling accounts that included details both geography and history some writers concentrated solely history like qubi and tabari whilst others focused small portion history such ibn azraq with history mecca and ibn abi tahir tayfur writing history baghdad the historian regarded the greatest all arabic historians though ibn khaldun whose history muqaddimah focuses society and founding text sociology and economics diaries the medieval near east arabic diaries were first being written from before the though the medieval diary which most resembles the modern diary was that ibn banna the his diary was the earliest arranged order date rikh very much like modern literary theory and criticism literary criticism arabic literature often focused religious and the several long religious traditions hermeneutics and textual exegesis have had profound influence the study secular this was particularly the case for the literary traditions islamic literature literary criticism was also employed other forms medieval arabic poetry and literature from the notably jahiz his bayan tabyin and hayawan and abdullah ibn tazz his kitab badi fiction literature one thousand and one nights the arab world there was great distinction between quality and ammiyyah language the common not many writers would write works this ammiyyah common language and was felt that literature had educational and with purpose rather than just this did not stop the common role the hakawati teller who would retell the entertaining parts more educational works one the many arabic fables folk tales which were often not written down many nevertheless some the earliest novels including the first philosophical novels were written arabic epic literature arabic epic literature the most famous example arabic fiction the one thousand and one nights arabian nights easily the best known all arabic literature and which still affects many the ideas arabs have about arabic culture good example the lack popular arabic prose fiction that the stories aladdin and ali baba usually regarded part the tales from one thousand and one nights were not actually part the tales they were first included french translation the tales antoine galland who heard them being told traditional storyteller and only existed incomplete arabic manuscripts before the other great character from arabic literature sinbad from the tales the one thousand and one nights usually placed the genre arabic epic literature along with several other they are usually collections short stories episodes strung together into long the extant versions were mostly written down relatively late after the although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many the original stories are probably types stories these collections include animal fables proverbs stories jihad propagation the humorous moral tales about the wily man ali zaybaq and tales about the prankster maqama maqama not only straddles the divide between prose and poetry being instead form rhymed prose also part way between fiction and over series short which are fictionalised versions real life different ideas are good example this maqama which purports compare the feature different perfumes but fact work political satire comparing several competing maqama also makes use the doctrine badi deliberately adding complexity display the dexterity with hamadhani regarded the originator the maqama and his work was taken abu muhammad qasim hariri with one maqama study hamadhani own maqama was incredibly popular form arabic being one the few forms which continued written during the decline arabic the and romantic literature famous example romantic arabic poetry layla and majnun dating back the umayyad era the tragic story undying love much like the later romeo and juliet which was itself said have been inspired latin version layla and majnun layla and majnun considered part the platonic love genre called because the couple never marry consummate their that prominent arabic though the literary motif found throughout the other famous virgin love stories include qays and lubna kuthair and azza marwa and majnun faransi and antara and abla the century encyclopedia the brethren purity features fictional anecdote prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast drunk spends the night confusing corpse with his bride the story used gnostic parable the pre existence and return from its terrestrial sojourn another medieval arabic love story was hadith bayad riyad the story bayad and riyad century arabic love the main characters the tale are son and foreigner from damascus and well educated girl the court unnamed hajib vizier iraq which referred the the hadith bayad riyad manuscript believed the only illustrated manuscript known have survived from more than eight centuries muslim and arab presence many the tales the one thousand and one nights are also love stories involve romantic love central this includes the frame story scheherazade herself and many the stories she narrates including aladdin the ebony horse the three apples tale and the princess the lover and the adi bin zayd and the princess ibil with the lady and muslim bin the three unfortunate and there were several elements courtly love which were developed arabic namely the notions love for and exaltation the beloved which have been traced back arabic literature the and the notion the ennobling love was developed the early century the persian psychologist and philosopher ibn sina known avicenna his arabic treatise risala ishq treatise love the final element courtly the concept love desire never was also times implicit arabic poetry murder mystery the earliest known example whodunit murder mystery was the three apples one the tales narrated scheherazade the one thousand and one nights arabian nights this fisherman discovers heavy locked chest along the tigris river and sells the abbasid caliph harun rashid who then has the chest broken open only find inside the dead body young woman who was cut into harun orders his vizier far ibn yahya solve the crime and find the murdererer within three executed fails his suspense generated through multiple plot twists that occur the story this may thus considered archetype for detective fiction satire and comedy arabic poetry the genre satirical poetry was known hija satire was introduced into prose literature the afro arab author jahiz the while dealing with serious topics what are now known anthropology sociology and psychology introduced satirical based the premise however serious the subject under could made more interesting and thus achieve greater only one leavened the lump solemnity the insertion few amusing anecdotes the throwing out some witty paradoxical was well aware treating new themes his prose would have employ vocabulary nature more familiar hija satirical for one his zoological works satirized the preference for longer human penis size writing the length the penis were sign then the mule would belong the honorable tribe quraysh another satirical story based this preference was arabian nights tale called ali with the large the the writer tha alibi recorded satirical poetry written the poets salami and abu with salami praising abu wide breadth knowledge and then mocking his ability all these and with abu dulaf responding back and satirizing salami example arabic political satire included another century poet jarir satirizing farazdaq transgressor the sharia and later arabic poets turn using the term form political the terms comedy and satire became synonymous after aristotle poetics was translated into arabic the medieval islamic world where was elaborated upon arabic writers and islamic philosophers such abu his pupil farabi avicenna and averroes due cultural they disassociated comedy from greek dramatic representation and instead identified with arabic poetic themes and such hija satirical they viewed comedy simply the art and made reference light and cheerful troublous beginnings and happy associated with classical greek after the latin translations the century the term comedy thus gained new semantic meaning medieval literature theatre while puppet theatre and passion plays were popular the medieval islamic world live theatre and drama has only been visible part arabic literature the modern there may have been much longer theatrical tradition but was probably not regarded legitimate literature and mostly went there ancient tradition public performance amongst shi muslims play depicting the life and death husayn the battle karbala there are also several plays composed shams din muhammad ibn daniyal the century when mentions that older plays are getting stale and offers his new works fresh the most popular forms theater the medieval islamic world were puppet theatre which included hand shadow plays and marionette productions and live passion plays known ziya where actors enact episodes from muslim history shia islamic plays revolved around the shaheed ali sons hasan ibn ali and husayn ibn ali live secular plays were known akhraja recorded medieval adab literature though they were less common than puppetry and ziya theater the moors had noticeable influence the works george peele and william shakespeare some their works featured moorish such the battle alcazar and the merchant venice titus andronicus and othello which featured moorish othello its title these works are said have been inspired several moorish delegations from morocco elizabethan england the beginning the ignoring the fact that the merchant venice and titus andronicus were both penned the philosophical novels the arab islamic philosophers ibn tufail and ibn nafis were pioneers the philosophical novel they wrote the earliest novels dealing with philosophical fiction ibn tufail wrote the first arabic novel hayy ibn yaqdhan philosophus autodidactus response ghazali the incoherence the philosophers this was followed ibn nafis who wrote fictional narrative theologus autodidactus response ibn philosophus autodidactus both these narratives had protagonists hayy philosophus autodidactus and kamil theologus autodidactus who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated cave and living seclusion desert island both being the earliest examples desert island however while hayy lives alone the desert island for most the story philosophus autodidactus until meets castaway named the story kamil extends beyond the desert island setting theologus autodidactus when castaways take him back civilization with developing into the earliest known coming age plot and eventually becoming the first example science fiction novel ibn nafis described his book theologus autodidactus defense the system islam and the doctrines the missions the religious the resurrection the and the transitoriness the presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality the human soul using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus prove his later islamic scholars viewed this work response the metaphysical claim avicenna and ibn tufail that bodily resurrection cannot proven through view that was earlier criticized ibn work was later translated into latin and english theologus autodidactus the early latin translation ibn entitled philosophus autodidactus first appeared prepared edward pococke the the first english translation simon ockley was published and german and dutch translations were also published the these translations later inspired daniel defoe write robinson crusoe which also featured desert island narrative and was regarded the first novel english philosophus autodidactus also inspired robert boyle acquaintance write his own philosophical novel set the aspiring naturalist the late the story also anticipated rousseau mile some and also similar the later story mowgli rudyard kipling the jungle book well the character tarzan that baby abandoned deserted tropical island where taken care and fed mother wolf other european writers influenced philosophus autodidactus include john locke gottfried leibniz

nafis introduces his scientific theory metabolism and makes references his own scientific discovery the pulmonary circulation order explain bodily the novel was later translated into english theologus autodidactus the early number stories within the one thousand and one nights arabian nights also feature science fiction one example the adventures where the protagonist bulukiya quest for the herb immortality leads him explore the journey the garden eden and jahannam and travel across the cosmos different worlds much larger than his own anticipating elements galactic science along the
