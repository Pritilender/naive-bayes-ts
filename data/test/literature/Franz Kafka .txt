among the greatest writers the gabriel rquez noted the reading the showed him that was possible write different the core theme first established the short story das son the guilt induced the son resolved through suffering and other prominent themes and archetypes include physical and psychological characters terrifying and mystical kafka style has been compared that kleist early review die and der oscar walzel berliner the nature prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into variety literary marxists for have sharply disagreed over how interpret some accused him distorting reality whereas others claimed was critiquing the hopelessness and absurdity common his works are seen emblematic existentialism some books are influenced the expressionist though the majority his literary output was associated with the experimental modernist genre kafka also touches the theme human conflict with william burrows claims that such work centred the concepts pain solitude and the need for others such thomas mann see work metaphysical for according gilles deleuze and lix guattari the themes alienation and although present have been emphasised they argue work more deliberate and and more than may first they point out that reading his work while focusing the futility his struggles reveals play not necessarily commenting his own but rather pointing out how people tend invent his kafka often created absurd kafka read drafts his works his typically concentrating his humorous the writer milan kundera suggests that surrealist humour may have been inversion dostoyevsky who presented characters who were punished for work character will punished although crime has not been kundera believes that inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing patriarchal family and living totalitarian attempts have been made identify the influence legal background and the role law his most interpretations identify aspects law and legality important his which the legal system often the law rather than being representative any particular legal political usually interpreted represent collection incomprehensible these are hidden from the individual but control the lives the who are innocent victims systems beyond their critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where kafka describes himself conflict with absurd such the following entry from his enclosed own four found myself immigrant imprisoned foreign saw family strange aliens whose foreign rites and very language defied though did not want they forced participate their bizarre could not however james hawes argues many descriptions the legal proceedings der process absurd bewildering and nightmarish they might are based accurate and informed descriptions german and austrian criminal proceedings the which were inquisitorial rather than adversarial although worked trained lawyer kafka was keenly aware the legal debates his early century publication that uses office writings its point pothik ghosh states that with law has meaning outside its fact being pure force domination and translations the earliest english translations works were edwin and willa muir who translated the first german edition das schloss this was published the castle secker warburg england and alfred knopf the united edition including homage thomas spurred surge popularity the united states the late the muirs translated all shorter works that kafka had seen fit they were published schocken books the penal stories and short pieces including additionally the

those dearest stories and other writings included translated eithne wilkins and ernst kaiser which had been deleted earlier known definitive they include translations the definitive the definitive and other these translations are generally accepted have number biases and are considered dated published schocken parables and paradoxes presented bilingual edition nahum glatzer selected drawn from diaries letters short fictional works and the novel der process new translations were completed and published based the recompiled german text pasley and the critical mark harman schocken books the critical breon mitchell schocken and amerika the man who disappeared michael hofmann new directions publishing translation problems english franz kafka works kafka often made extensive use characteristic particular the german language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span entire kafka sentences then deliver unexpected impact just before the full that being the finalizing meaning and this due the construction subordinate clauses german which require that the verb positioned the end the such constructions are difficult duplicate the translator provide the reader with the same least effect found the original german more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways the same german writing can translated into example the first sentence the which crucial the setting and understanding the entire als gregor samsa eines morgens aus unruhigen traumen erwachte fand sich seinem bett einem ungeheuren ungeziefer verwandelt gregor samsa one morning from restless dreams found himself his bed into enormous vermin literal word another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators how deal with the intentional use ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result phrasing difficult precisely one such instance found the first sentence the english translators often render the word ungeziefer insect middle however ungeziefer literally means animal unclean for german means sometimes used colloquially mean bug very general unlike the scientific insect kafka had intention labeling the protagonist the any specific but instead wanted convey disgust his another example use the german noun verkehr the final sentence das literally verkehr means intercourse can have either sexual sexual used mean transport the sentence can translated that moment unending stream traffic crossed over the the double meaning verkehr given added weight confession brod that when wrote that final was thinking violent legacy kafkaesque jaroslav writing has inspired the term kafkaesque used describe concepts and situations reminiscent his particularly der process and die examples include instances which bureaucracies overpower often nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings disorientation and characters kafkaesque setting often lack clear course action escape the kafkaesque elements often appear existential but the term has transcended the literary realm apply life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly bizarre numerous films and television works have been described and the style particularly prominent dystopian science works this genre that have been thus described include terry film brazil and the science fiction film noir dark city films from other genres which have been similarly described include the tenant and barton fink the television series the prisoner also frequently described commemoration the franz kafka museum prague dedicated kafka and his major component the museum
