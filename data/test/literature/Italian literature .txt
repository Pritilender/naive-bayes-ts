pronounced according italian latin the language the epic poetry belonged both examples include the chansons geste macaire the entre espagne written niccola padua the prise pampelune and all this preceded the appearance purely italian the emergence native vernacular literature the french and occitan languages gradually gave way the native hybridism but longer the bovo antona and the rainaldo lesengrino the venetian dialect clearly although the language influenced french these which graziadio isaia ascoli has called miste immediately preceded the appearance purely italian there evidence

such are labeled the first literary works the italian their dates ranging from the last decades the century the early decades the however points such early literature does not yet present any uniform stylistic linguistic this early however was simultaneous the whole varying only the subject matter the the the poems giacomino verona and bonvicino riva were specially and were intended recited the they were written dialect milanese and their style bore the influence french narrative they may considered belonging the popular kind taking the however broad this sort composition may have been encouraged the old custom the north italy listening the piazzas and the highways the songs the jongleurs the crowds were delighted with the stories the wickedness macaire and the misfortunes blanziflor the terrors the babilonia infernale and the blessedness the gerusalemme celeste and the singers religious poetry vied with those the chansons geste sicilian school sicilian school the year marked the beginning the sicilian school and literature showing more uniform its importance lies more the language the creation the first standard than its song partly modeled the poetry imported the south the normans and the svevs under frederick this poetry differs from the french equivalent its treatment the less erotic and more platonic vein further developed dolce stil novo later century bologna and florence the customary repertoire chivalry terms adapted italian phonotactics creating new italian the french suffixes and generated hundreds new italian words iera and for riv iera and costan these were adopted dante and his and handed future generations italian the sicilian school belonged enzio king sardinia pietro della vigna inghilfredi guido and odo delle colonne jacopo aquino

form later perfected dante and petrarch the censorship imposed frederick meant that political matter entered literary this the poetry the still divided into communes city states with relatively democratic provided new these new ideas are shown the sirventese genre and dante commedia his lines are full invectives against contemporary political leaders and though the conventional song prevailed and later manfred court more spontaneous poetry existed the contrasto attributed cielo alcamo this contrasto between two lovers the sicilian dialect not the most ancient the only southern poem popular belongs without doubt the time the emperor frederick later than and important proof that there existed independent poetry the contrasto probably scholarly elaboration lost popular rhyme and the closest kind poetry that perished was smothered the ancient sicilian its distinguishing point was its possession all qualities opposite the poetry the rhymers the sicilian though its style may betray knowledge and there probably satiric intent the mind the anonymous poet vigorous the expression the conceits sometimes bold and very show that its subject matter everything about the contrasto the poems the sicilian school were written the first known standard this was elaborated these poets under the direction frederick and combines many traits typical the and but not negligible apulian dialects and other southern with many words latin and french dante styles illustre cardinale aulico curiale were developed from his linguistic study the sicilian which had been founded guittone arezzo tuscany the standard changed slightly because tuscan scriveners perceived the vowel system used southern italian vowel the texts that italian students read their anthology contain lines that not rhyme with each other sometimes and that may account for its decrease popularity through the and early religious literature the century religious movement took place with the rise the dominican and franciscan orders the earliest preserved sermons italian language are from jordan pisa francis assisi mystic and reformer the catholic church the founder the also wrote though was francis poetry was beneath the refined poetry the center according francis dictated the hymn cantico del sole the eighteenth year his almost rapt doubts remain about its was the first great poetical work northern written kind verse marked assonance poetic device more widespread northern other poems previously attributed francis are now generally recognized lacking jacopone todi was poet who represented the

francis third order took pleasure being laughed and was followed crowd people who mocked him and called after him jacopone jacopone went raving for subjecting himself the severest and giving vent his religious intoxication his jacopone was mystic who from his hermit cell looked out into the world and specially watched the scourging with his words pope celestine and pope boniface for which was the religious movement umbria was followed another literary the religious raniero fasani left the cavern where had lived for many years and suddenly appeared perugia fasani represented himself sent god disclose mysterious and announce the world terrible this was turbulent period political faction the guelphs and ghibellines interdicts and excommunications issued the and reprisals the imperial this fasani pronouncements stimulated the formation the compagnie disciplinanti who for scourged themselves until they drew and sang laudi dialogue their confraternities these laudi closely connected with the liturgy were the first example the drama the vernacular tongue they were written the umbrian dialect verses eight and according the encyclop dia britannica have not any artistic their however was early the end the century the devozioni del giovedi venerdi santo appeared mixing liturgy and later monaco che ando servizio dio monk who entered the service approached the definite form the religious drama would assume the following first tuscan literature century tuscany was unique the tuscans spoke dialect that closely resembled latin and afterward almost the language and which was already regarded the end the century surpassing other lingua tusca magis apta est literam sive literaturam the tuscan tongue better suited the letter wrote antonio tempo padua born about after the fall the hohenstaufen the battle benevento was the first province from florence began political reform movement that the appointment the priori delle arti and establishment the arti minori this was later copied siena with the magistrato dei nove lucca pistoia and other guelph cities tuscany with similar popular the guilds took the government into their and was time social and political too popular love poetry school imitators the sicilians was led dante majano but its literary originality took another line that humorous and satirical the entirely democratic form government created style poetry that stood strongly against the medieval mystic and chivalrous devout invocation god lady came from the cloister and the castle the streets the cities everything that had gone before was treated with ridicule biting sarcasm folgore san gimignano laughs when his sonnets tells party sienese youths the occupations every month the when teaches party florentine lads the pleasures every day the cenne della chitarra laughs when parodies the sonnets rustico filippo are fun and the work cecco angiolieri the oldest humorist off precursor rabelais and montaigne another kind poetry also began guittone arezzo made art quit chivalry and forms for national motives and latin attempted political and although his work often prepared the way for the bolognese bologna was the city and philosophical poetry appeared guido guinizelli was the poet after the new fashion the his work the ideas chivalry are changed and only those whose heart pure can blessed with true regardless refuted the traditional credo courtly for which love subtle philosophy only few chosen knights and princesses could love blind blasons but not good heart when finds when succeeds the result the not physical affinity between teo

regarded with respect and admiration but fact dispossessed its political guinizelli canzoni make the bible dolce stil and one cor kind considered the manifesto the new movement that bloomed florence under dante and their his poetry has some the faults the school nevertheless marks great development the history italian especially because his close connection with lyric poetry the there were several major allegorical poems one these brunetto latini who was close friend his tesoretto short syllable rhyming which the author lost wilderness and meets who represents nature and gives him much see here allegory and instruction with moral three elements find again the divine comedy francesco barberino learned lawyer who was secretary bishops judge and notary wrote two little allegorical the documenti amore and del reggimento dei costumi delle donne the poems today are generally studied not but for historical fourth allegorical work was the intelligenza which sometimes attributed but probably only translation french the humanist and publisher aldus manutius published tuscan poets petrarch and dante alighieri the divine comedy creating the model for what became standard for modern development early prose italian prose the century was abundant and varied its the earliest example dates from and consists short notices entries and expenses mattasala spinello dei lambertini this there was sign literary prose though there was french halfway through the certain aldobrando from either florence wrote book for beatrice savoy countess called gime corps martino canale wrote history venice the same old french langue rusticiano pisa who was for long while the court edward england composed many chivalrous derived from the arthurian cycle and subsequently wrote the travels marco

prose writing scientific composizione del mondo ristoro arezzo who lived about the middle the this work copious treatise astronomy and geography ristoro was careful observer natural many the things relates were the result his personal and consequently his works are more reliable than those other writers the time similar another short treatise regimine rectoris fra paolino minorite friar who was probably bishop pozzuoli and who also wrote latin his treatise stands close relation that egidio colonna regimine principum written the venetian language the century was very rich collection called the cento novelle antiche contains stories drawn from many including greek and trojan ancient and medieval the legends brittany provence and the bible local italian and histories animals and old mythology this book has distant resemblance the spanish collection known conde lucanor the peculiarity the italian book that the stories are very and seem mere outlines filled the narrator goes other prose novels were inserted francesco barberino his work del reggimento dei costumi delle donne but they are much less the whole the italian novels the century have little and are faint reflection the very rich legendary literature france some attention should paid the lettere fra guittone who wrote many poems and also some letters the subjects which are moral and guittone love antiquity and the traditions rome and its language was strong that tried write italian latin the letters are involved and altogether guittone took his special model seneca the younger and hence his prose became guittone viewed his style very but later scholars view extravagant and dolce stil novo the year period new literature developing from the tuscan with the school lapo gianni guido cavalcanti cino pistoia and dante alighieri lyric poetry became exclusively the whole novelty and poetic power this consisted according quando amore noto quel niodo detta significando that power expressing the feelings the soul the way which love inspires appropriate and graceful fitting form and art fusing one with the love divine gift that redeems man the eyes and the mistress the angel sent from heaven show the way this platonic approach widely endorsed dolce stil novo and although case can upsetting and even nonetheless metaphysical experience able lift man onto spiritual gianni new style was still influenced the cavalcanti poems fall into two those that portray the sottilissimo dialettico lorenzo the magnificent called and those more directly the product his poetic nature imbued with mysticism and metaphysics the first set belongs the famous poem sulla natura amore which fact treatise amorous metaphysics and was annotated later learned way renowned platonic philosophers the such marsilius ficinus and other cavalcanti tends stifle poetic imagery under dead weight the other his ballate pours himself out but with consciousness his the greatest these considered the ballata composed cavalcanti when was banished from florence with the party the bianchi and took refuge sarzana the third poet among the followers the new school was cino the family the sinibuldi his love poems are mellow and the the roots renaissance dante dante alighieri sandro botticelli one the greatest italian also shows these lyrical wrote vita nuova new called indicate that his first meeting with beatrice was the beginning new which idealizes collection poems which dante added narration and everything aerial heavenly and the real beatrice supplanted idealized vision losing her human nature and becoming representation the dante the main character the and the narration purports though historical information about life proves this poetic several the lyrics the vita nuova deal with the theme the new not all the love poems refer however other pieces are philosophical and bridge over the convivio the divine comedy divine comedy divina commedia made dante and raised him above all other men genius dubious discuss tells the travels through the three realms the hell purgatory and paradise accompanied the latin poet virgil allegorical meaning hides under the literal one this great dante travelling through purgatory and symbolizes mankind aiming the double object temporal and eternal the forest where the poet loses himself symbolizes the civil and religious confusion deprived its two the emperor and the the mountain illuminated the sun universal the three beasts are the three vices and the three powers that offered the greatest obstacles envy light fickle and divided the black guelphs and the white guelphs pride the house avarice the papal virgil represents reason and the beatrice the symbol the supernatural aid mankind must have attain the supreme which the merit the poem does not lie the which still connects with medieval literature what new the individual art the the classic art transfused for the first time into romance whether describes analyses curses the vices sings hymns the dante notable for the grandeur and delicacy his took the materials for his poem from theology philosophy history and but especially from his own from hatred and under the pen the the dead come life

they stand before all the life their their and their the real chastizer the sins and rewarder virtues dante the personal interest brings bear the historical representation the three worlds what most interests and stirs dante remakes history after his own thus the divina commedia not only lifelike drama contemporary thoughts and but also clear and spontaneous reflection the individual feelings the from the indignation the citizen and the exile the faith the believer and the ardour the the divina commedia defined the destiny italian giving artistic lustre all forms literature the middle ages had petrarch petrarch uffizi two facts characterize the literary life petrarch classical research and the new human feeling introduced into his lyric the facts are not rather the former caused the latter citation needed the petrarch who unearthed the works the great latin writers helps understand the petrarch who loved real named and celebrated her her life and after her death poems full studied petrarch was the first humanist and was the same time the first modern lyric his career was long and lived for many years avignon cursing the corruption the papal travelled through nearly the whole corresponded with emperors and and was considered the most important writer his his canzoniere divided into three the first containing the poems written during the second the poems written after her the third the trionfi the one and only subject these poems but the treatment full variety imagery and derived from the most varied impressions petrarch lyric verse quite not only from that the troubadours and the italian poets before but also from the lyrics petrarch psychological who examines all his feelings and renders them with art exquisite the lyrics petrarch are longer transcendental like but keep entirely within human the second part the canzoniere the more the trionfi are them petrarch tried imitate the divina commedia but the canzoniere includes also few political one supposed addressed cola rienzi and several sonnets against the court these are remarkable for their vigour and also for showing compared petrarch had sense broader italian wooed italy that was different from any conceived the people the middle was precursor modern times and modern petrarch had decided political exalted cola invoked the emperor charles and praised the visconti his politics were affected more impressions than above all this was his love which his mind was reunited with the great city his cicero and scipio petrarca some began the renaissance boccaccio giovanni boccaccio boccaccio had the same enthusiastic love antiquity and the same worship for the new italian literature was the first put together latin translation the iliad and the odyssey his classical learning was shown the work genealogia deorum which enumerates the gods according genealogical trees from the various authors who wrote about the pagan the genealogia deorum heeren said encyclopaedia mythological and was the precursor the humanist movement the boccaccio was also the first historian women his mulieribus claris and the first tell the story the great unfortunates his casibus virorum illustrium continued and perfected former geographical investigations his interesting book silvis fontibus lacubus fluminibus stagnis nominibus maris for which made use vibius sequester his italian his lyrics not come anywhere near the perfection his narrative poetry did not invent the octave stanza but was the first use work length and artistic his teseide the oldest italian romantic the filostrato relates the loves troiolo and griseida troilus and cressida may that boccaccio knew the french poem the trojan war benoit more but the interest his poem lies the analysis the passion the ninfale fiesolano tells the love story the nymph mesola and the shepherd the amorosa visione poem doubtless owed its origin the divina commedia the ameto mixture prose and and the first italian pastoral the filocopo takes the earliest place among prose romances boccaccio tells the loves florio and probably for this work drew materials from popular source from byzantine romance which leonzio pilato may have mentioned the filocopo there remarkable exuberance the mythological which damages the romance artistic but contributes the history the fiammetta another about the loves boccaccio and maria supposed natural daughter king whom always called this name boccaccio became famous principally for the italian decamerone collection hundred related party men and women who retired villa near florence escape the plague novel abundant the preceding especially now for the first time assumed artistic the style boccaccio tends the imitation but him prose first took the form elaborated the rudeness the old fabliaux gives place the careful and conscientious work mind that has feeling for what that has studied the classic and that strives imitate them much over and above the decamerone boccaccio delineator character and observer this lies his much has been written about the sources the novels the decamerone probably boccaccio made use both written and oral popular tradition must have furnished him with the materials many for that unlike who was always preoccupied wearied with disturbed find boccaccio serene satisfied with himself and with his notwithstanding these fundamental differences their the two great authors were old and warm but their affection for dante was not petrarch who says that saw him once his did not preserve pleasant recollection and would useless deny that was jealous his the divina commedia was sent him when was old and confessed that never read the other boccaccio felt for dante something more than wrote biography him which some critics deprecate the accuracy and gave public critical lectures the poem santa maria del fiore others imitators fazio degli uberti and federico frezzi were imitators the divina commedia but only its external the former wrote the dittamondo long which the author supposes that was taken the geographer solinus into different parts the and that his commedia guide related the history the legends the rise the different italian cities have some importance frezzi bishop his native town foligno wrote the quadriregio poem the four kingdoms satan the and the this poem has many points resemblance with the divina commedia frezzi pictures the condition man who rises from state vice one and describes limbo purgatory and the poet has pallas for ser giovanni fiorentino wrote under the title pecorone collection

taken from florentine his book gives lifelike picture florentine society the end the the subjects are almost always but evident that sacchetti collected these anecdotes could draw his own conclusions and moral which puts the end each from this point sacchetti work comes near the monalisaliones the middle third novelist was giovanni sercambi who after wrote imitation about party people who were supposed fly from plague and travelling about different italian stopping here and there telling later but names are those masuccio salernitano tommaso who wrote the novellino and antonio cornazzano whose proverbii became extremely chronicles chronicles formerly believed have been the century are now mainly regarded the end the century there chronicle dino compagni probably giovanni villani born was more chronicler than relates the events the journeys that made italy and and the information thus mean that his the historie fiorentine covers events all over speaks not only events politics and but the stipends public the sums money used pay for soldiers and public and many other things which knowledge villani narrative often encumbered with fables and particularly when speaks things that happened before his matteo was the brother giovanni and continued the chronicle was again continued filippo ascetics the divine commedia ascetic its and good many points its petrarch work has similar yet neither petrarch nor dante could classified among the pure ascetics their but many other writers come under this catherine siena mysticism was this extraordinary woman aspired bring back the church rome evangelical and left collection letters written high and lofty tone all kinds including hers the clearest religious utterance have made itself heard century although precise ideas

romantic political works many poets the century produced political fazio degli uberti the author dittamondo who wrote serventese the lords and people poem and fierce invective against charles deserves francesco vannozzo frate stoppa and matteo frescobaldi may said general that following the example petrarch many writers devoted themselves patriotic from this period also dates that literary phenomenon known under the name the those who sang imitating were found already the but others treated the same subject with more manner that might called such were the ballate ser giovanni franco niccolo soldanieri and guido and bindo donati ballate were poems sung and have very many songs for music the have already stated that antonio pucci versified chronicle enough notice chronicle arezzo

cultivation style what occupies him his hands the style becomes wonderfully plastic every whether high serious with the octave stanza reached high level variety and pietro bembo pietro bembo was influential figure the development the italian language specifically literary and his writings assisted the century revival interest the works petrarch bembo attempted restore some the legendary affect that ancient greek had its but tuscan italian held his and the highest example poetic expression ever achieved the work petrarch and two century writers assisted bringing back into the prose della volgar lingua set petrarch the perfect and discussed verse composition including stress the sounds balance and the specific placement words with strict attention their consonants and their their position within lines long and could produce emotions ranging from sweetness and grace gravity and grief this work was decisive importance the development the italian the most famous secular musical form the was these carefully constructed the case analyzed according that were the primary texts for the torquato tasso the historians italian literature are doubt whether tasso should placed the period the highest development the whether should form period intermediate between that and the one certainly was profoundly out harmony with his own his religious the seriousness his the deep melancholy settled his his continued aspiration after ideal all place him outside the literary epoch represented ariosto and carducci said tasso the legitimate heir and reasons his faith and comments his love learned and writes dialogues scholastic speculation that would considered was only eighteen years old tried his hand epic and wrote rinaldo which said that had tried reconcile the aristotelian rules with the variety later wrote the aminta pastoral drama exquisite but the work which had long turned his thoughts was heroic and that absorbed all his explains his intentions the three discorsi written while composed the gerusalemme would choose great and wonderful not ancient have lost all nor recent prevent the poet from embellishing with invented would treat rigorously according the rules the unity action observed greek and latin but with far greater variety and splendour that this point should not fall short the romantic and would write lofty and ornate this what tasso has done the gerusalemme liberata the subject which the liberation the sepulchre jesus christ the century godfrey bouillon the poet does not follow faithfully all the historical but sets before the principal causes bringing the supernatural agency god and the gerusalemme the best heroic poem that italy can approaches classical its episodes above all are most there profound feeling and everything reflects the melancholy soul the regards the however although tasso studiously endeavoured keep close the classical one cannot help noticing that makes excessive use metaphor antithesis fetched and specially from this point view that some historians have placed tasso the literary period generally known under the name secentismo and that more moderate their have said that prepared the way for minor writers meanwhile side side with the there was attempt the historical gian giorgio trissino vicenza composed poem called italia liberata dai goti full learning and the rules the formed himself the order sing the campaigns belisarius said that had forced himself observe all the rules aristotle and that had imitated homer this see one the products the renaissance and although work poor invention and without any original poetical yet helps one understand better what were the conditions mind the lyric poetry was certainly not one the kinds that rose any great height the originality was entirely since seemed that century nothing better could done than copy still even this style there were some vigorous monsignore giovanni guidiccioni lucca showed that had generous fine sonnets expressed his grief for the sad state his francesco molza modena learned latin and wrote graceful style and with giovanni della casa and pietro bembo although were even michelangelo was times but his poems bear the stamp his extraordinary and original and good many ladies are placed near these such vittoria colonna loved veronica gambara tullia aragona and giulia gonzaga poets great and superior genius many literary men their many tragedies were written the but they are all the cause this was the moral and religious indifference the the lack strong passions and vigorous the first occupy the tragic stage was trissino with his sofonisba following the rules the art most but written sickly and without warmth the oreste and the rosmunda giovanni rucellai were nor luigi alamanni antigone sperone speroni his canace and giraldi cintio his orbecche tried become innovators tragic but provoked criticisms grotesquerie and debate over the role they were often seen inferior the torrismondo torquato tasso specially remarkable for the which sometimes remind one the chorus the greek tragedies the italian comedy the century was almost entirely modelled the latin they were almost always alike the the characters the old the the and the argument was often the thus the lucidi agnolo firenzuola and the vecchio amoroso donato giannotti were modelled comedies plautus were the sporta giambattista gelli the marito lodovico dolce and there appear only three writers who should distinguished among the many who wrote machiavelli ariosto and giovan maria cecchi his mandragola machiavelli unlike the composed comedy creating personalities that seem living even now because copied them from reality with finely observant ariosto the other was distinguished for his picture the habits his and especially those the ferrarese rather than for the objective delineation lastly cecchi left his comedies treasure spoken which lets wonderful acquaint ourselves with that the notorious pietro aretino might also included the list the best writers the century included humorous antonio cammelli surnamed the specially deserving because his pungent bonhomie sainte beuve called but was francesco berni who and carried this kind literature perfection the from him the style has been called bernesque the berneschi find nearly the same phenomenon that already noticed with regard orlando furioso was art for arts sake that inspired and moved berni well antonio francesco grazzini called and other lesser may said that there nothing their and true that they specially delight praising low and disgusting things and jeering what noble and bernesque poetry the clearest reflection that religious and moral scepticism that was characteristic italian social life the and that showed itself most the works that scepticism that stopped the religious reformation italy and which its turn was effect historical the and especially berni sometimes assumed satirical but theirs could not called true pure the other were antonio vinciguerra lodovico alamanni and the last superior the others for the attic elegance his and for certain passing into which particularly interesting when the poet talks the century there were not few didactic works his poem api giovanni rucellai approaches the perfection virgil his style clear and and adds interest his book frequent allusions the events the the most important didactic however cortigiano which imagines discussion the palace the dukes urbino between knights and ladies what gifts perfect courtier requires this book valuable illustration the intellectual and moral state the highest italian society the first half the the novelists the the two most important were and matteo bandello the former playful and bizarre the latter grave and bandello was dominican friar and but that notwithstanding his novels were very loose and that often holds the ecclesiastics his time time when admiration for qualities the desire for classical was strong the much attention was naturally paid translating latin and greek among the very numerous translations the time those the aeneid and the pastorals longus the sophist annibale caro are still are

new especially imitation pindar treating moral historical and amatory chiabrera though elegant attempts disguise lack substance with poetical ornaments every nevertheless chiabrera school marks and sometimes shows lyrical wasted his literary arcadia the belief arose that would necessary change the form order restore the academy arcadia was its founders were giovan maria crescimbeni and gian vincenzo gravina the arcadia was called because its chief aim was imitate the simplicity the ancient shepherds who were supposed have lived arcadia the golden the secentisti erred overweening desire

from the turgid into the the arcadia was reaction against secentismo but reaction that only succeeded impoverishing still further and completely withering italian the poems the arcadians fill many and are made sonnets madrigals canzonette and blank verse the one who most distinguished himself among the sonneteers was felice zappi among the authors paolo rolli was innocenzo frugoni was more famous

many his comedies were written venetian dialect giuseppe parini the leading figure the literary revival the century was giuseppe parini born lombard village was educated and youth was known among the arcadian poets the name darisbo even parini showed collection poems published three years under the name ripano the poet shows his faculty taking his scenes from real and his satirical pieces exhibits

the trifles which they were made and the book thus assumes major social and historical going straight back classical aspiring imitate virgil and opened the way the school vittorio alfieri ugo foscolo and vincenzo monti work the giorno wonderful for its delicate the verse has new sometimes little hard and protest against the arcadian the linguistic purism whilst the most burning political passions were and whilst the most brilliant men genius the new classical and patriotic school were purists the height their question arose about purism language the second half the century the italian language was specially full french there was great indifference about still more about elegance prose needed restored for the sake national and was believed that this could not done except going back the writers the the aurei trecentisti they were else the classics italian one the promoters the new school was antonio cesari who republished ancient and brought out new with the vocabolario della crusca wrote dissertation sopra stato presente della lingua italiana and endeavoured establish the supremacy tuscan and the three great dante petrarch and accordance with that principle wrote several taking pains copy the trecentisti closely but patriotism italy has always had something municipal this tuscan proclaimed and upheld there was opposed lombard which would know nothing and with vulgari eloquentia returned the idea the lingua illustre this was old largely and bitterly argued the cinquecento varchi muzio lodovico castelvetro speroni and now the question was raised the head the lombard school were monti and his law count giulio perticari this caused monti write pro pasta alcune correzioni aggiunte vocabolario della crusca which attacked the tuscanism the crusca but graceful and easy form prose that one the most beautiful italian perticari whose intellect was narrowed and exacerbated the question two degli scrittori del trecento and dell amor patrio dante the dispute about language took its place beside literary and political and all italy took part basilio puoti paolo costa the romagna marc antonio parenti modena salvatore betti giovanni gherardini luigi fornaciari and vincenzo nannucci classicist and purist all once was pietro giordani born was almost compendium the literary movement the his whole life was battle for learned greek and latin and the italian trecentisti left only few but they were carefully elaborated point and his prose was greatly admired its giordani closes the literary epoch the minor writers gasparo gozzi satire was less but directed towards the same end his osservatore something like joseph addison spectator his gazzetta veneta and the mondo morale means allegories and novelties hit the vices with delicate introducing practical gozzi satire has some slight resemblance style lucian gozzi prose graceful and but imitates the writers the another satirical writer the first half the century was giuseppe baretti journal called the frusta letteraria mercilessly criticized the works then being published had learnt much his long stay britain had contributed the independent character his the frusta was the first book independent criticism directed particularly against the arcadians and the was born giambattista niccolini literature was politics was ghibelline rare exception guelph florence his imitating aeschylus well writing the discorsi sulla tragedia greca and the sublime michelangelo niccolini displayed his passionate devotion ancient his tragedies set himself free from the excessive rigidity and partly approached the english and german tragic nearly always chose political striving keep alive his compatriots the love such are nabucco antonio foscarini giovanni procida lodovico moro and assailed papal rome arnaldo brescia long tragic not suited for and epic rather than niccolini tragedies show rich lyric vein rather than dramatic has the merit having vindicated liberal and having opened new path italian carlo botta born was spectator french spoliation italy and the overbearing rule wrote history italy from and later continued history wrote after the manner the latin trying imitate putting together long and sonorous periods style that aimed being like caring little about what constitutes the critical material only intent declaiming his academic prose for his botta wanted classical style that could longer and hence failed completely attain his literary his fame only that man noble and patriotic not bad the two histories italy that the guerra indipendenza americana close botta comes pietro colletta neapolitan born nine years after also his storia del reame napoli dal had the idea defending the independence and liberty italy style borrowed from tacitus and succeeded rather better than has brief nervous which makes his book attractive but said that pietro giordani and gino capponi corrected for lazzaro papi author the commentari della rivoluzione francese dal was not altogether unlike botta and also was historian the classical and treats his subject with patriotic but artist perhaps excels the other the patriotism and classicism the ideas behind the french revolution gave special direction italian literature the second half the love liberty and desire for equality created literature aimed national seeking improve the condition the country freeing from the double yoke political and religious the italians who aspired political redemption believed inseparable from intellectual and thought that this could only effected reunion with ancient this was repetition what had occurred the first half the vittorio alfieri patriotism and classicism were the two principles that inspired the literature that began with vittorio alfieri worshipped the greek and roman idea popular liberty arms against took the subjects his tragedies from the history these nations and made his ancient characters talk like revolutionists his the arcadian with its verbosity and was his aim was concise strong and aim the sublime opposed the lowly and saved literature from arcadian leading towards national and armed himself with patriotism and vincenzo monti vincenzo monti was patriot but his own had one deep feeling that ruled rather the mobility his feelings his but each these was new form patriotism that took the place old saw danger his country the french and wrote the pellegrino apostolico the bassvilliana and the feroniade napoleon victories caused him write the pronreteo and the musagonia his fanatismo and his superstizione attacked the papacy afterwards sang the praises the austrians thus every great event made him change his with readiness that might seem but easily monti above everything else him was liable knowing little succeeded translating the iliad way remarkable for its homeric and his bassvilliana level with him classical poetry seemed revive all its florid ugo foscolo ugo foscolo was eager inspired classical the lettere jacopo ortis inspired goethe werther are love story with mixture they contain violent protest against the treaty campo formio and outburst from own heart about unhappy affair his passions were sudden and one these passions ortis owed its and perhaps the best and most sincere all his still sometimes pompous and but less for the lectures dell origine ufficio della letteratura the foscolo prose turgid and and reflects the character man who always tried pose dramatic this was indeed the defect the napoleonic epoch there was horror anything simple natural everything must assume some heroic foscolo this tendency was the sepolcri which his best was prompted high and the mastery versification shows wonderful there are most obscure passages where seems even the author did not form clear left incomplete three hymns the graces which sang beauty the source all high qualities and among his prose works high place belongs his translation the sentimental journey laurence sterne writer whom foscolo was deeply went exile and died wrote for english readers some essays petrarch and the texts the decamerone and which are remarkable for when they were and which may have initiated new kind literary criticism foscolo still greatly and not without the men who made the revolution were brought his romanticism and the risorgimento the romantic school had its organ the conciliatore established the staff which were silvio pellico lodovico breme giovile scalvini tommaso grossi giovanni berchet samuele biava and alessandro manzoni all were influenced the ideas especially constituted the movement called romanticism italy the course literary reform took another alessandro manzoni the main instigator the reform was formulated the objects the new saying that aspired try discover and express vero storico and vero morale not only but the widest and eternal source the realism art that characterizes italian literature from manzoni the promessi sposi the betrothed the work that has made him doubt the idea the historical novel came him from sir walter scott citation needed but manzoni succeeded something more than historical novel the narrow meaning that created eminently realistic work the attention entirely fixed the powerful objective creation the from the greatest the least they have wonderful manzoni able unfold character all particulars and follow through its different don abbondio and renzo are perfect azzeccagarbugli and manzoni dives down into the innermost recesses the human and draws from the most subtle psychological this his greatness which was recognized first his companion goethe poet too had gleams especially the napoleonic cinque maggio and where describes human some stanzas the inni and the chorus the adelchi giacomo leopardi the great poet the age was giacomo leopardi born thirteen years after manzoni recanati patrician became familiar with greek authors that used afterwards say that the greek mode thought was more clear and living his mind than the latin even the solitude sickness and domestic tyranny prepared him for profound passed into complete religious from which sought rest everything terrible and grand his which are the most agonizing cry modern uttered with solemn quietness that once elevates and terrifies citation needed was also admirable prose his operette morali dialogues and discourses marked cold and bitter smile human destinies that freezes the the clearness the simplicity language and the depth conception are such that perhaps not only the greatest lyrical poet since but also one the most perfect writers prose that italian literature has history and politics the realism art gained the positive method criticism kept pace with history returned its spirit learned shown such works the archivio storico italiano established florence giampietro vieusseux the storia italia nel medio evo carlo troya remarkable treatise manzoni sopra alcuni punti della storia longobardica italia and the very fine history the vespri siciliani michele

antologia his archivio storico italiano was under different continuation the antologia which was suppressed owing the action the russian florence was those days the asylum all the italian and these exiles met and shook hands where there was more literary than political but where one thought and one only animated all the thought the literary movement that preceded and was contemporary with the political revolution may said represented four writers giuseppe giusti francesco domenico guerrazzi vincenzo gioberti and cesare balbo giusti wrote epigrammatic satires popular incisive phrases scourged the enemies was telling political but mediocre guerrazzi had great reputation and great but his historical though avidly read before were soon gioberti powerful polemical writer had noble
