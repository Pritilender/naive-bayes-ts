shakespeare wrote romeo and juliet juliet nurse refers earthquake she says occurred years this may refer the dover straits earthquake which would date that particular line other both england and have been proposed support the different but the stylistic similarities with midsummer dream and other plays conventionally dated around place its composition sometime between and one conjecture that shakespeare may have begun draft which completed shakespeare romeo and juliet was published two quarto editions prior the publication the first folio these are referred and the first printed appeared early printed john because its text contains numerous differences from the later labelled bad quarto the century editor spencer described detestable probably reconstruction the play from the imperfect memories one two the suggesting that had been pirated for alternative explanation for shortcomings that the play like many others the may have been heavily edited before performance the playing any its appearance early makes the latest possible date for the the superior called the play the most excellent and lamentable tragedie romeo and juliet was printed thomas creede and published cuthbert burby about lines longer than its title page describes newly augmented and scholars believe that was based performance draft called his foul papers since there are textual oddities such variable tags for characters and false for speeches that were presumably struck through the author but erroneously preserved the much more complete and reliable and was reprinted and all later quartos and folios romeo and juliet are based are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from the later editions whether good are likely arise from editors not from the first folio text was based primarily with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from theatrical promptbook other folio editions the play were printed and modern that take into account several the folios and first appeared with nicholas rowe edition followed alexander pope version pope began tradition editing the play add information such stage directions missing locating them this tradition continued late into the romantic period fully annotated editions first appeared the victorian period and continue produced printing the text the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the themes and motifs scholars have found extremely difficult assign one overarching theme the proposals for main theme include discovery the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly but instead are more less awaking out dream and into the danger hasty the power tragic none these have widespread however even overall theme cannot found clear that the play full several thematic elements that intertwine complex several those most often debated scholars are discussed love romeo profane with unworthiest hand this holy the gentle sin two blushing ready stand smooth that rough touch with tender juliet good you wrong your hand too which mannerly devotion shows for saints have hands that hands and palm palm holy kiss romeo and juliet romeo and juliet sometimes considered have unifying save that young romeo and juliet have become emblematic young lovers and doomed since such obvious subject the several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance the their first romeo and juliet use form communication recommended many etiquette authors metaphor using metaphors saints and romeo was able test feelings for him threatening this method was recommended baldassare castiglione whose works had been translated into english this pointed out that man used metaphor the woman could pretend she did not understand and could retreat without losing juliet however participates the metaphor and expands the religious metaphors shrine pilgrim and saint were fashionable the poetry the time and more likely understood romantic rather than the concept sainthood was associated with the catholicism earlier later the shakespeare removes the more daring allusions resurrection the tomb found his source brooke romeus and juliet the later balcony shakespeare has romeo overhear but version the story her declaration done bringing romeo into the scene shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence usually woman was required modest and shy make sure that her suitor was but breaking this rule serves speed along the the lovers are able skip and move plain talk about their agreeing married after knowing each other for only one the final suicide there contradiction the the catholic suicides were often thought condemned whereas people who die with their loves under the religion love are joined with their loves romeo and love seems expressing the religion view rather than the catholic another point that although their love only consummated which keeps them from losing the the play arguably equates love and sex with throughout the both romeo and along with the other fantasise about dark being often equating with capulet for when first discovers death describes having deflowered his juliet later erotically compares romeo and right before her suicide she grabs saying happy this thy there and let fate and chance scholars are divided the role fate the consensus exists whether the characters are truly fated die together whether the events take place series unlucky arguments favour fate often refer the description the lovers star this phrase seems hint that the stars have predetermined the future john draper points out the parallels between the elizabethan belief the four humours and the main characters the play for tybalt interpreting the text the light humours reduces the amount plot attributed chance modern still other scholars see the play series unlucky many such degree that they not see tragedy but emotional melodrama ruth nevo believes the high degree which chance stressed the narrative makes romeo and juliet lesser not for romeo challenging tybalt not after the expected action this nevo reads romeo being aware the dangers flouting social norms identity and makes the choice not because tragic flaw but because duality light and brawling loving any thing nothing first heavy serious misshapen chaos seeming feather bright cold sick waking that not what scholars have long noted widespread use light and dark imagery throughout the caroline spurgeon considers the theme light symbolic the natural beauty young and later critics have expanded this for both romeo and juliet see the other light surrounding romeo describes juliet being like the brighter than jewel sparkling the and bright angel among dark even when she lies apparently dead the says her beauty makes this vault feasting presence full juliet describes romeo day and whiter than snow upon this contrast light and dark can expanded contrasting love and youth and age metaphoric sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony for romeo and love light the midst the darkness the hate around but all their activity together done night and while all the feuding done broad this paradox imagery adds atmosphere the moral dilemma facing the two loyalty family loyalty the end the when the morning gloomy and the sun hiding its face for light and dark have returned their proper the outward darkness reflecting the inner darkness the family feud out sorrow for the all characters now recognise their folly light recent and things return the natural thanks the love and death romeo and the light theme the play also heavily connected the theme since light was convenient way for shakespeare express the passage time through descriptions the moon and time these times woe afford time time plays important role the language and plot the both romeo and juliet struggle maintain imaginary world void time the face the harsh realities that surround for when romeo swears his love juliet the she protests swear not the inconstant that monthly changes her circled lest that thy love prove likewise from the very the lovers are designated referring astrologic belief associated with stars were thought control the fates and time stars would move along their course the also charting the course human lives romeo speaks foreboding feels the movements early the and when learns defies the course for another central theme shakespeare romeo and juliet spans period four six contrast spanning nine scholars such thomas tanselle believe that time was especially important this used references for the young lovers opposed references for the older highlight headlong rush towards romeo and juliet fight time make their love last the the only way they seem defeat time through death that makes them immortal through time also connected the theme light and plays were most often performed noon the afternoon broad this forced the playwright use words create the illusion day and night his shakespeare uses references the night and the the and the sun create this also has characters frequently refer days the week and specific hours help the audience understand that time has passed the all fewer than references time are found the adding the illusion its criticism and interpretation critical history samuel pepys john hayls the earliest known critic the play was diarist samuel pepys who wrote play itself the worst that ever heard poet john dryden wrote years later praise the play and its comic character shakespear the best his skill his mercutio and said that was kill him the third prevent being killed criticism the play the century was less but less publisher nicholas rowe was the first critic ponder the theme the which saw the just punishment the two feuding writer charles gildon and philosopher lord kames argued that the play was failure that did not follow the classical rules the tragedy must occur because some character flaw not accident writer and critic samuel johnson however considered one most plays the later part the and through the criticism centred debates over the moral message the actor and playwright david garrick adaptation excluded romeo abandoning her for juliet was seen fickle and critics such charles dibdin argued that rosaline had been purposely included the play show how reckless the hero and that this was the reason for his tragic others argued that friar laurence might spokesman his warnings against undue with the advent the these moral arguments were disputed critics such richard green moulton argued that and not some character led the deaths dramatic structure romeo and juliet shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have garnered praise from most notably the abrupt shifts from comedy tragedy example the punning exchange between benvolio and mercutio just before tybalt before death act the play largely after his accidental the play suddenly becomes serious and takes tragic when romeo rather than and friar laurence offers juliet plan reunite her with the audience can still hope that all will end they are breathless state the opening the last scene the romeo delayed long enough for the friar and juliet may yet these shifts from hope reprieve and new serve emphasise the tragedy when the final hope fails and both the lovers die the shakespeare also uses plots offer clearer view the actions the main for when the play romeo love with who has refused all his romeo infatuation with her stands obvious contrast his later love for this provides comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness romeo and love and paris love for juliet also sets contrast between feelings for him and her feelings for the formal language she uses around well the way she talks about him her show that her feelings clearly lie with beyond the sub plot the capulet feud overarches the whole providing atmosphere hate that the main contributor the tragic language shakespeare uses variety poetic forms throughout the begins with line prologue the form shakespearean sonnet spoken most romeo and juliet however written blank verse and much strict iambic pentameter with less rhythmic variation than most later choosing shakespeare matches the poetry the character who uses friar for uses sermon and sententiae forms and the nurse uses unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech each these forms also moulded and matched the emotion the scene the character for when romeo talks about rosaline earlier the attempts use the petrarchan sonnet form petrarchan sonnets were often used men exaggerate the beauty women who were impossible for them situation with this sonnet form used lady capulet describe count paris juliet handsome when romeo and juliet the poetic form changes from the petrarchan which was becoming archaic then more contemporary sonnet using pilgrims and saints finally when the two meet the romeo attempts use the sonnet form pledge his but juliet breaks saying dost thou love doing she searches for true rather than poetic exaggeration their juliet uses monosyllabic words with but uses formal language with other forms the play include epithalamium rhapsody queen mab speech and elegy shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people the though times uses for other such humour also scholar molly mahood identifies least puns and wordplays the many these jokes are sexual especially those involving mercutio and the psychoanalytic criticism early psychoanalytic critics saw the problem romeo and juliet terms deriving from partially disguised which leads both death and the double romeo and juliet not considered exceedingly psychologically and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with norman writing considers dream realistic wish fulfilling fantasy both terms adult world and his hypothetical childhood stages phallic and while acknowledging that dramatic character not human being with mental processes separate from those the critics such julia kristeva focus the hatred between the arguing that this hatred the cause romeo and passion for each that hatred manifests itself directly the language juliet for speaks only love sprung from only and often expresses her passion through anticipation this leads speculation the particular consideration grief for the death his hamnet feminist criticism feminist literary critics argue that the blame for the family feud lies patriarchal society for lia for the masculine code violence imposed romeo the main force driving the tragedy its when tybalt kills romeo shifts into this violent regretting that juliet has made him effeminate this the younger males become engaging violence behalf their the case the their the feud also linked male the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly juliet also submits female code docility allowing such the solve her problems for other such dympna look the feminism from historicist angle stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged increasingly centralised government and the advent the same emerging puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with the evils female than those earlier and more sympathetic towards when juliet dodges her attempt force her marry man she has feeling she challenging the patriarchal order way that would not have been possible earlier queer theory number critics have found the character mercutio have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for jonathan goldberg examined the sexuality mercutio and romeo utilising queer theory queering the renaissance comparing their friendship with sexual mercutio friendly mentions phallus suggesting traces homoeroticism example his joking wish raise spirit his circle letting there stand till she had laid and conjured romeo homoeroticism can also found his attitude woman who distant and unavailable and brings hope benvolio she best replaced someone who will shakespeare procreation sonnets describe another young man like having trouble creating offspring and who may seen being goldberg believes that shakespeare may have used rosaline way express homosexual problems procreation acceptable this when juliet says that which call any other name would smell she may raising the question whether there any difference between the beauty man and the beauty legacy day richard burbage romeo romeo and
