mathematics	addition navigation search addition apples addition mathematical operation that represents the total amount objects together signified the plus sign for the picture the there are apples meaning three apples and two apples which total apples therefore besides counting addition can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds negative numbers fractions irrational numbers vectors decimals functions matrices and addition has several important commutative meaning that order does not and associative meaning that when one adds more than two the order which addition performed does not matter see summation repeated addition the same counting addition does not change addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such subtraction and multiplication all these rules can proven starting with the addition natural numbers and generalizing through the real numbers and general binary operations that have similar properties are studied abstract algebra performing addition one the simplest numerical addition very small numbers accessible the most basic can performed infants young five months and even some primary education students are taught add numbers the decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus the modern computer where research the most efficient implementations addition continues this contents notation and terminology interpretations combining sets extending length properties commutativity associativity identity element successor units performing addition innate ability discovering addition children addition table decimal system computers addition natural and real numbers natural numbers integers rational numbers real numbers generalizations addition abstract algebra addition set theory and category theory related operations arithmetic ordering other ways add literature notes references notation and terminology addition written using the plus sign between the that infix notation the result expressed with equals sign for below below there are also situations where addition understood even though symbol columnar column with the last number the column underlined usually indicates that the numbers the column are with the sum written below the underlined whole number followed immediately fraction indicates the sum the called mixed number for this notation can cause confusion since most other contexts juxtaposition denotes multiplication instead the sum series related numbers can expressed through capital sigma notation which compactly denotes for the numbers the objects added general addition are collectively referred the terms the addends the summands this terminology carries over the summation multiple this distinguished from factors which are multiplied some authors call the first addend the augend during the renaissance many authors did not consider the first addend addend today due the commutative property augend rarely and both terms are generally called all this terminology derives from latin addition and add are english words derived from the latin verb addere which turn compound and dare from the proto european root thus add give using the gerundive suffix results addend thing likewise from augere one gets augend thing the art nombryng sum and summand derive from the latin noun summa the the and associated verb summare this appropriate not only because the sum two positive numbers greater than but because was once common add contrary the modern practice adding that sum was literally higher than the addere and summare date back least boethius not earlier roman writers such vitruvius and frontinus boethius also used several other terms for the addition the later middle english terms adden and adding were popularized chaucer interpretations addition used model countless physical even for the simple case adding natural numbers there are many possible interpretations and even more visual combining sets possibly the most fundamental interpretation addition lies combining when two more disjoint collections are combined into single the number objects the single collection the sum the number objects the original this interpretation easy with little danger also useful higher for the rigorous definition see natural numbers below however not obvious how one should extend this version addition include fractional numbers negative one possible fix consider collections objects that can easily such pies still segmented rather than just combining collections rods can joined which illustrates another conception adding not the rods but the lengths the extending length second interpretation addition comes from extending initial length given when original length extended given the final length the sum the original length and the length the the sum can interpreted binary operation that combines and algebraic can interpreted the addition more units under the latter the parts sum play asymmetric and the operation viewed applying the unary operation instead calling both and addends more appropriate call the augend this since plays passive the unary view also useful when discussing subtraction because each unary addition operation has inverse unary subtraction and vice properties commutativity addition commutative meaning that one can reverse the terms sum and the result the same the last symbolically and are any two then the fact that addition commutative known the commutative law this phrase suggests that there are other commutative for there commutative law however many binary operations are not such subtraction and misleading speak unqualified commutative associativity somewhat subtler property addition associativity which comes when one tries define repeated should the expression defined mean that addition associative tells that the choice definition for any three numbers and true that for not all operations are expressions with other operations like important specify the order operations identity element when adding zero any the quantity does not zero the identity element for also known the additive identity for any this law was first identified brahmagupta brahmasphutasiddhanta although wrote three separate depending whether positive zero and used words rather than algebraic later indian mathematicians refined the around the year mahavira wrote zero becomes the same what added corresponding the unary statement the bhaskara wrote the addition subtraction the positive remains the corresponding the unary statement successor the context addition one also plays special for any integer the integer the least integer greater than also known the successor because this the value some can also seen the successor making addition iterated units numerically add physical quantities with units they must first expressed with common for measure feet extended the sum since inches synonymous with the other usually meaningless try add meters and square since those units are this sort consideration fundamental dimensional analysis performing addition innate ability studies mathematical development starting around the have exploited the phenomenon habituation infants look longer situations that are seminal experiment karen wynn involving mickey mouse dolls manipulated behind screen demonstrated that old infants expect and they are comparatively surprised when physical situation seems imply that either this finding has since been affirmed variety laboratories using different another experiment with older toddlers between months exploited their development motor control allowing them retrieve ping pong balls from the youngest responded well for small while older subjects were able compute sums even some nonhuman animals show limited ability particularly primates experiment imitating result but using eggplants instead rhesus macaques and cottontop tamarins performed similarly human more after being taught the meanings the arabic numerals through one chimpanzee was able compute the sum two numerals without further discovering addition children typically children first master counting when given problem that requires that two items and three items young children model the situation with physical often fingers and then count the they gain they learn discover the strategy asked find two plus children count three past saying four five usually ticking off and arriving this strategy seems almost children can easily pick from peers most discover with additional children learn add more quickly exploiting the commutativity addition counting from the larger this case starting with three and counting five eventually children begin recall certain addition facts number bonds either through experience rote once some facts are committed children begin derive unknown facts from known for child asked add six and seven may know that and then reason that one such derived facts can found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely mixture memorized and derived facts add addition table children are often presented with the addition table the first numbers knowing one can perform any decimal system the prerequisite addition the decimal system the fluent recall derivation the single digit addition one could memorize all the facts rote but based strategies are more enlightening for most more commutative property mentioned using the pattern reduces the number addition from one two more adding basic and can accomplished through counting ultimately intuition zero since zero the additive adding zero nonetheless the teaching some students are introduced addition process that always increases the word problems may help rationalize the exception doubles adding number itself related counting two and multiplication doubles facts form backbone for many related and students find them relatively easy near doubles sums such can quickly derived from the doubles fact adding one from but subtracting five and ten sums the form and are usually memorized early and can used for deriving other for can derived from adding one making ten advanced strategy uses intermediate for sums involving for students grow they commit more facts and learn derive other facts rapidly and many students never commit all the facts but can still find any basic fact the standard algorithm for adding multidigit numbers align the addends vertically and add the starting from the ones column the column exceeds the extra digit carried into the next alternate strategy starts adding from the most significant digit the this route makes carrying little but faster getting rough estimate the there are many other alternative methods fraction addition scientific operations computers summing amplifier analog computers work directly with physical their addition mechanisms depend the form the mechanical adder might represent two addends the positions sliding which case they can added with averaging lever the addends are the rotation speeds two shafts they can added with differential hydraulic adder can add the pressures two chambers exploiting newton second law balance forces assembly pistons the most common situation for purpose analog computer add two voltages referenced ground this can accomplished roughly with resistor network but better design exploits operational amplifier addition also fundamental the operation digital computers where the efficiency particular the carry mechanism important limitation overall difference engine blaise pascal invented the mechanical calculator was the first operational adding machine made use ingenious assisted carry was the only operational mechanical calculator the century and the earliest digital pascal calculator was limited its carry mechanism which forced its wheels only turn one could add the operator had use the method complements which required many steps pascal was followed giovanni poleni who built the second functional mechanical calculator calculating which was made wood and which once multiply two numbers full adder adders execute integer addition electronic digital usually using binary arithmetic the simplest architecture the ripple carry which follows the standard digit one slight improvement the carry skip design again following human one does not perform all the carries computing but one bypasses the group and skips the since they compute digits one the above methods are too slow for most modern modern digital integer addition typically the fastest arithmetic yet has the largest impact since underlies all the floating point operations well such basic tasks address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching increase modern designs calculate digits parallel these schemes such names carry carry lookahead and the ling pseudocarry almost all modern implementations hybrids these last three unlike addition paper addition computer often changes the the ancient abacus and adding board both addends are leaving only the the influence the abacus mathematical thinking was strong enough that early latin texts often claimed that the process adding number both numbers modern the add instruction microprocessor replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the high level programming language evaluating does not change either the goal replace with the sum this must explicitly typically with the statement some languages such allow this abbreviated addition natural and real numbers prove the usual properties one must first define addition for the context addition first defined the natural numbers set theory addition then extended progressively larger sets that include the natural the integers the rational numbers and the real numbers mathematics education positive fractions are added before negative numbers are even this also the historical natural numbers natural number there are two popular ways define the sum two natural numbers and one defines natural numbers the cardinalities finite the cardinality set the number elements the then appropriate define their sum let the cardinality set take two disjoint sets and with and then defined here the union and alternate version this definition allows and possibly overlap and then takes their disjoint union mechanism that allows common elements separated out and therefore counted the other popular definition let the successor that the number following the natural define define the general sum recursively hence again there are minor variations upon this definition the taken the above definition application the recursion theorem the poset the other some sources prefer use restricted recursion theorem that applies only the set natural one then considers temporarily fixed applies recursion define function and pastes these unary operations for all together form the full binary this recursive formulation addition was developed dedekind early and would expand upon the following proved the associative and commutative among through mathematical induction for examples such inductive see addition natural numbers integers integer the simplest conception integer that consists absolute value which natural and sign generally either positive negative the integer zero special third being neither positive nor the corresponding definition addition must proceed for integer let its absolute let and either treat and are both define and are both define and have different define the difference between and with the sign the term whose absolute value although this definition can useful for concrete far too complicated produce elegant general there are too many cases much more convenient conception the integers the grothendieck group construction the essential observation that every integer can expressed not the difference two natural may well define integer the difference two natural addition then defined compatible with given two integers and where and are natural define rational numbers addition rational numbers can computed using the least common denominator but conceptually simpler definition involves only integer addition and define the commutativity and associativity rational addition easy consequence the laws integer for more rigorous and general see field fractions real numbers construction the real numbers common construction the set real numbers the dedekind completion the set rational real number defined dedekind cut non empty set rationals that closed downward and has greatest element the sum real numbers and defined element define this definition was first slightly modified richard dedekind the commutativity and associativity real addition are defining the real number the set negative easily seen the additive probably the trickiest part this construction pertaining addition the definition additive dealing with multiplication dedekind cuts case nightmare similar the addition signed another approach the metric completion the rational real number essentially defined the limit cauchy sequence lim addition defined term define this definition was first published georg cantor also although his formalism was slightly one must prove that this operation dealing with cauchy once that task all the properties real addition follow immediately from the properties rational furthermore the other arithmetic including have analogous generalizations there are many things that can numbers vectors matrices spaces shapes sets functions equations strings chains alexander bogomolny there are many binary operations that can viewed generalizations the addition operation the real the field abstract algebra centrally concerned with such generalized and they also appear set theory and category theory addition abstract algebra linear algebra vector space algebraic structure that allows for adding any two vectors and for scaling familiar vector space the set all ordered pairs real the ordered pair interpreted vector from the origin the euclidean plane the point the the sum two vectors obtained adding their individual this addition operation central classical mechanics which vectors are interpreted forces modular arithmetic the set integers modulo has twelve inherits addition operation from the integers that central musical set theory the set integers modulo has just two the addition operation inherits known boolean logic the exclusive function geometry the sum two angle measures often taken their sum real numbers modulo this amounts addition operation the circle which turn generalizes addition operations dimensional tori the general theory abstract algebra allows addition operation any associative and commutative operation basic algebraic structures with such addition operation include commutative monoids and abelian groups addition set theory and category theory reaching generalization addition natural numbers the addition ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers set these give two different generalizations addition natural numbers the transfinite unlike most addition addition ordinal numbers not addition cardinal however commutative operation closely related the disjoint union operation category theory disjoint union seen particular case the coproduct operation and general coproducts are perhaps the most abstract all the generalizations some such direct sum and wedge sum are named evoke their connection with related operations arithmetic subtraction can thought kind that the addition additive inverse subtraction itself sort inverse that adding and subtracting are inverse functions given set with addition one cannot always define corresponding subtraction operation that the set natural numbers simple the other subtraction operation uniquely determines addition additive inverse and additive for this additive group can described set that closed under multiplication can thought repeated single term appears sum times then the sum the product and not natural number the product may still make for multiplication yields the additive inverse the real and complex addition and multiplication can interchanged the exponential function this identity allows multiplication carried out consulting table logarithms and computing addition also enables multiplication slide rule the formula still good order approximation the broad context lie groups where relates multiplication infinitesimal group elements with addition vectors the associated lie algebra there are even more generalizations multiplication than multiplication operations always distribute over this requirement formalized the definition ring some such the distributivity over addition and the existence multiplicative identity enough uniquely determine the multiplication the distributive property also provides information about expanding the product both one concludes that addition forced for this ring addition commutative division arithmetic operation remotely related since division right distributive over however division not left distributive over not the same ordering log log plot the maximum operation max binary operation similar two nonnegative numbers and are different orders magnitude then their sum approximately equal their this approximation extremely useful the applications for example truncating taylor series however presents perpetual difficulty numerical analysis essentially since max not much greater than then straightforward calculation can accumulate unacceptable round off error perhaps even returning see also loss significance the approximation becomes exact kind infinite either infinite cardinal number their cardinal sum exactly equal the greater the accordingly there subtraction operation for infinite maximization commutative and like furthermore since addition preserves the ordering real addition distributes over max the same way that multiplication distributes over for these tropical geometry one replaces multiplication with addition and addition with this addition called tropical maximization called tropical and the tropical additive negative infinity some authors prefer replace addition with then the additive identity positive tying these observations tropical addition approximately related regular addition through the logarithm which becomes more accurate the base the logarithm the approximation can made exact extracting constant named analogy with planck constant from quantum mechanics and taking the classical limit tends this the maximum operation dequantized version other ways add incrementation also known the successor operation the addition summation describes the addition arbitrarily many usually more than just includes the idea the sum single which and the empty sum which zero infinite summation delicate procedure known series counting finite set equivalent summing over the integration kind summation over continuum more precisely and over differentiable manifold integration over dimensional manifold reduces linear combinations combine multiplication and they are sums which each term has usually real complex number linear combinations are especially useful contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization such mixing strategies game theory superposition states quantum mechanics convolution used add two independent random variables defined distribution functions its usual definition combines subtraction and convolution useful kind side vector addition kind side literature chapter lewis
