geometry based more abstract techniques abstract algebra especially commutative algebra with the language and the problems geometry the fundamental objects study algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties which are geometric manifestations solutions systems polynomial equations examples the most studied classes algebraic varieties plane algebraic curves which include lines circles parabolas ellipses hyperbolas cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates and cassini ovals point the plane belongs algebraic curve its coordinates satisfy given polynomial basic questions involve the study the points special interest like the singular points the inflection points and the points infinity more advanced questions involve the topology the curve and relations between the curves given different algebraic geometry occupies central place modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields complex analysis topology and number theory initially study systems polynomial equations several the subject algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves and becomes even more important understand the intrinsic properties the totality solutions system than find specific this leads into some the deepest areas all both conceptually and terms the algebraic geometry has split into several the main stream algebraic geometry devoted the study the complex points the algebraic varieties and more generally the points with coordinates algebraically closed field the study the points algebraic variety with coordinates the field the rational numbers number field became arithmetic geometry more classically diophantine subfield algebraic number theory the study the real points algebraic variety the subject real algebraic geometry large part singularity theory devoted the singularities algebraic with the rise the computational algebraic geometry area has which lies the intersection algebraic geometry and computer algebra consists essentially developing algorithms and software for studying and finding the properties explicitly given algebraic much the development the main stream algebraic geometry the century occurred within abstract algebraic with increasing emphasis being placed intrinsic properties algebraic varieties not dependent any particular way embedding the variety ambient coordinate this parallels developments topology differential and complex geometry one key achievement this abstract algebraic geometry grothendieck scheme theory which allows one use sheaf theory study algebraic varieties way which very similar its use the study differential and analytic manifolds this obtained extending the notion classical algebraic point affine variety may through hilbert nullstellensatz with maximal ideal the coordinate ring while the points the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals this this means that point such scheme may either usual point this approach also enables unification the language and the tools classical algebraic mainly concerned with complex and algebraic number wiles proof the longstanding conjecture called fermat last theorem example the power this contents basic notions zeros simultaneous polynomials affine varieties regular functions morphism affine varieties rational function and birational equivalence projective variety real algebraic geometry computational algebraic geometry bner basis cylindrical algebraic decomposition asymptotic complexity practical efficiency abstract modern viewpoint history prehistory before the century and early century century applications see also notes references basic notions algebraic variety zeros simultaneous polynomials classical algebraic the main objects interest are the vanishing sets collections polynomials meaning the set all points that simultaneously satisfy one more polynomial equations for the dimensional sphere dimensional euclidean space could defined the set all points with slanted circle can defined the set all points which satisfy the two polynomial equations affine varieties affine variety first start with field classical algebraic this field was always the complex numbers but many the same results are true assume only that algebraically closed consider the affine space dimension over denoted more simply when clear from the when one fixes coordinates one may identify with the purpose not working with emphasize that one forgets the vector space structure that carries function said polynomial regular can written that there polynomial such that for every point with coordinates the property function polynomial does not depend the choice coordinate system when coordinate system the regular functions the affine space may identified with the ring polynomial functions variables over therefore the set the regular functions which denoted say that polynomial vanishes point evaluating that point gives let set polynomials the vanishing set vanishing locus zero set the set all points where every polynomial vanishes other subset which for some called algebraic set the stands for variety specific type algebraic set defined given subset can one recover the set polynomials which generate any subset define the set all polynomials whose vanishing set contains the stands for ideal two polynomials and both vanish then vanishes and any then vanishes always ideal the polynomial ring two natural questions ask given subset when given set when the answer the first question provided introducing the zariski topology topology whose closed sets are the algebraic and which directly reflects the algebraic structure then and only algebraic set equivalently closed the answer the second question given hilbert nullstellensatz one its says that the radical the ideal generated more abstract there galois connection giving rise two closure operators they can and naturally play basic role the the example elaborated galois for various reasons may not always want work with the entire ideal corresponding algebraic set hilbert basis theorem implies that ideals are always finitely algebraic set called irreducible cannot written the union two smaller algebraic any algebraic set finite union irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition thus its elements are called the irreducible components the algebraic irreducible algebraic set also called variety turns out that algebraic set variety and only may defined the vanishing set prime ideal the polynomial some authors not make clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use irreducible variety make the distinction when regular functions regular function just continuous functions are the natural maps topological spaces and smooth functions are the natural maps differentiable manifolds there natural class functions algebraic called regular functions polynomial functions regular function algebraic set contained the restriction regular function for algebraic set defined the field the complex the regular functions are smooth and even analytic may seem unnaturally restrictive require that regular function always extend the ambient but very similar the situation normal topological space where the tietze extension theorem guarantees that continuous function closed subset always extends the ambient topological just with the regular functions affine the regular functions form which denote this ring called the coordinate ring since regular functions come from regular functions there relationship between the coordinate specifically regular function the restriction two functions and then polynomial function which null and thus belongs thus may identified with morphism affine varieties using regular functions from affine variety can define regular maps from one affine variety first will define regular map from variety into affine let variety contained choose regular functions and call them define regular map from letting other each determines one coordinate the range variety contained say that regular map from the range contained the definition the regular maps apply also algebraic the regular maps are also called morphisms they make the collection all affine algebraic sets into category where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the morphisms are the regular the affine varieties subcategory the category the algebraic given regular map from and regular function then the map ring homomorphism from conversely every ring homomorphism from defines regular map from this defines equivalence categories between the category algebraic sets and the opposite category the finitely generated reduced this equivalence one the starting points scheme theory rational function and birational equivalence rational mapping contrarily the preceding this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic the other hand the definitions extend naturally projective varieties next affine variety and its projective completion have the same field affine its coordinate ring integral domain and has thus field fractions which denoted and called the field the rational functions shortly the function field its elements are the restrictions the rational functions over the affine space containing the domain rational function not but the complement the subvariety where the denominator vanishes like for regular one may define rational map from variety variety like for the regular the rational maps from may identified the field homomorphisms from two affine varieties are birationally equivalent there two rational functions between them which are inverse one the other the regions where both are equivalently they are birationally equivalent their function fields are affine variety rational variety birationally equivalent affine this means that the variety admits rational for the circle equation rational has the parameterization which may also viewed rational map from the line the the problem resolution singularities know every algebraic variety birationally equivalent variety whose projective completion nonsingular see also smooth completion has been positively solved characteristic heisuke hironaka and yet unsolved finite projective variety algebraic geometry projective spaces many properties the affine varieties depend their behaviour for consider the variety draw get parabola increases the slope the line from the origin the point becomes larger and decreases the slope the same line becomes smaller and compare this the variety this cubic curve increases the slope the line from the origin the point becomes larger and larger just but unlike decreases the slope the same line again becomes larger and the behavior different from the behavior the consideration the projective completion the two which their prolongation the projective plane allows quantify this the point infinity the parabola regular point whose tangent the line infinity while the point infinity the cubic curve cusp also both curves are they are parameterized and riemann roch theorem implies that the cubic curve must have which must all its points the affine space are thus many the properties the algebraic including birational equivalence and all the topological properties depends the behavior and thus imply study the varieties the projective furthermore the introduction projective techniques made many theorems algebraic geometry simpler and for theorem the number intersection points between two varieties can stated its sharpest form only projective for these projective space plays fundamental role algebraic nowadays the projective space dimension usually defined the set the lines passing through considered the the affine space dimension equivalently the set the vector lines vector space dimension when coordinate system has been chosen the space dimension all the points line have the same set the multiplication element this defines the homogeneous coordinates point sequence elements the base field defined the multiplication nonzero element the same for the whole given polynomial variables vanishes all the point line passing through the origin and only homogeneous this one says that the polynomial vanishes the corresponding point this allows define projective algebraic set the set where vanishes finite set homogeneous polynomials like for affine algebraic there bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced homogeneous ideals which define the projective varieties are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal other projective variety projective algebraic whose homogeneous coordinate ring integral domain the projective coordinates ring being defined the quotient the graded ring the polynomials variables the homogeneous ideal defining the every projective algebraic set may uniquely decomposed into finite union projective the only regular functions which may defined properly projective variety are the constant thus this notion not used projective the other hand the field the rational functions function field useful which similarly the affine defined the set the quotients two homogeneous elements the same degree the homogeneous coordinate real algebraic geometry real algebraic geometry the real algebraic geometry the study the real points the algebraic the fact that the field the reals number ordered field may not occulted such for the curve equation circle but does not have any real point follows that real algebraic geometry not only the study the real algebraic but has been generalized the study the semi algebraic sets which are the solutions systems polynomial equations and polynomial for branch the hyperbola equation not algebraic but algebraic set defined and and one the challenging problems real algebraic geometry the unsolved hilbert sixteenth problem decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals nonsingular plane curve degree computational algebraic geometry one may date the origin computational algebraic geometry meeting international symposium symbolic and algebraic held marseille france june this dennis arnon showed that george collins cylindrical algebraic decomposition allows the computation the topology algebraic bruno buchberger presented the bner bases and his algorithm compute daniel lazard presented new algorithm for solving systems homogeneous polynomial equations with computational complexity which essentially polynomial the expected number solutions and thus simply exponential the number the this algorithm strongly related with macaulay multivariate resultant since most results this area are related one several these items either using improving one these finding algorithms whose complexity simply exponential the number the bner basis bner basis bner basis system generators polynomial ideal whose computation allows the deduction many properties the affine algebraic variety defined the given ideal defining algebraic set empty over algebraically closed extension the basis and only the bner basis for any monomial ordering reduced mean the hilbert series one may compute the dimension and the degree from any bner basis for monomial ordering refining the total the dimension one may compute the points finite from any bner basis see systems polynomial equations bner basis computation allows remove from all irreducible components which are contained given hyper bner basis computation allows compute the zariski closure the image the projection the first and the subset the image where the projection not more generally bner basis computations allows compute the zariski closure the image and the critical points rational function into another affine bner basis computations not allow compute directly the primary decomposition nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components but most algorithms for this involve bner basis the algorithms which are not based bner bases use regular chains but may need bner bases some exceptional bner base are deemed difficult fact they may the worst polynomials whose degree doubly exponential the number variables and number polynomials which also doubly however this only worst case and the complexity bound algorithm may frequently faug and algorithms realize this algorithm may viewed improvement algorithm follows that the best implementations allow compute almost routinely with algebraic sets degree more than this means presently the difficulty computing bner basis strongly related the intrinsic difficulty the cylindrical algebraic decomposition cad algorithm which had been introduced collins implement with acceptable complexity tarski theorem quantifier elimination over the real this theorem concerns the formulas the first order logic whose atomic formulas are polynomial equalities inequalities between polynomials with real these formulas are thus the formulas which may constructed from the atomic formulas the logical operators and not for all and exists tarski theorem asserts from such one may compute equivalent formula without quantifier the complexity cad doubly exponential the number this means that cad solve every problem real algebraic geometry which may expressed such that almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and algebraic while bner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only rare cad has almost always this high this implies unless most polynomials appearing the input are may not solve problems with more than four since most the research this subject devoted either improve cad find alternate algorithms special cases general example the state there are efficient algorithms find least point every connected component algebraic and thus test algebraic set the other hand cad the best algorithm count the number connected asymptotic complexity practical efficiency the basic general algorithms computational geometry have double exponential worst case complexity more the maximal degree the input polynomials and the number their complexity most for some constant and for some the complexity least for another constant during the last years various algorithms have been introduced solve specific subproblems with better most these algorithms have complexity among these algorithms which solve sub problem the problems solved bner one may cite testing affine variety empty and solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have finite number such algorithms are rarely implemented most entries faug and algorithms have better practical efficiency and probably similar better complexity probably because the evaluation the complexity bner basis algorithms particular class entries difficult task which has done only few special the main algorithms real algebraic geometry which solve problem solved cad are related the topology algebraic one may cite counting the number connected components testing two points are the same components computing whitney stratification real algebraic set they have complexity but the constant involved notation high that using them solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved impossible even one could use all the existing computing power the therefore these algorithms have never been implemented and this active research area search for algorithms with have together good asymptotic complexity and good practical abstract modern viewpoint the modern approaches algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range basic objects various levels generality formal schemes ind schemes algebraic spaces algebraic stacks and the need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory the formal functions zariski can accommodated introducing nilpotent elements structure considering spaces loops and constructing quotients group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead some the further most late algebraic varieties were subsumed into alexander grothendieck concept scheme their local objects are affine schemes prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form category which antiequivalent the category commutative unital extending the duality between the category affine algebraic varieties over field and the category finitely generated reduced the gluing along zariski one can glue within the category locally ringed but using the yoneda within the more abstract category presheaves sets over the category affine the zariski topology the set theoretic sense then replaced grothendieck topology grothendieck introduced grothendieck topologies having mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude zariski namely the tale topology and the two flat grothendieck fppf and nowadays some other examples became prominent including nisnevich topology sheaves can furthermore generalized stacks the sense usually with some additional representability conditions leading artin stacks even deligne mumford stacks both often called algebraic sometimes other algebraic sites replace the category affine for nikolai durov has introduced commutative algebraic monads generalization local objects generalized algebraic versions tropical geometry absolute geometry over field one element and algebraic analogue arakelov geometry were realized this another formal generalization possible universal algebraic geometry which every variety algebras has its own algebraic the term variety algebras should not confused with algebraic variety the language stacks and generalizations has proved valuable way dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones modern algebraic algebraic stacks can further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection this often the most natural one can extend the grothendieck site affine schemes higher categorical site derived affine schemes replacing the commutative rings with infinity category differential graded commutative algebras simplicial commutative rings similar category with appropriate variant grothendieck one can also replace presheaves sets presheaves simplicial sets infinity then presence appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop notion derived stack such presheaf the infinity category derived affine which satisfying certain infinite categorical version sheaf axiom and inductively sequence representability quillen model categories segal categories and quasicategories are some the most often used tools formalize this yielding the derived algebraic geometry introduced the school carlos simpson including andre bertrand gabrielle michel and and developed further jacob lurie bertrand and gabrielle vezzosi another version derived algebraic using infinity categories has been developed from early maxim kontsevich and history prehistory before the century some the roots algebraic geometry date back the work the hellenistic greeks from the century the delian problem for was construct length that the cube side contained the same volume the rectangular box for given sides and menechmus circa considered the problem geometrically intersecting the pair plane conics and the later the century archimedes and apollonius studied more systematically problems conic sections and also involved the use the arab mathematicians were able solve purely algebraic means certain cubic and then interpret the results this was for ibn haytham the century subsequently persian mathematician omar born discovered the general method solving cubic equations intersecting parabola with each these early developments algebraic geometry dealt with questions finding and describing the intersections algebraic such techniques applying geometrical constructions algebraic problems were also adopted number renaissance mathematicians such gerolamo cardano and niccol fontana tartaglia their studies the cubic the geometrical approach construction rather than the algebraic was favored most and century notably blaise pascal who argued against the use algebraic and analytical methods the french mathematicians franciscus vieta and later ren descartes and pierre fermat revolutionized the conventional way thinking about construction problems through the introduction coordinate geometry they were interested primarily the properties algebraic curves such those defined diophantine equations the case and the algebraic reformulation the classical greek works conics and cubics the case during the same blaise pascal and rard desargues approached geometry from different developing the synthetic notions projective geometry pascal and desargues also studied but from the purely geometrical point the analog the greek ruler and compass construction ultimately the analytic geometry descartes and fermat won for supplied the century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed study physical problems using the new calculus newton and leibniz however the end the most the algebraic character coordinate geometry was subsumed the calculus infinitesimals lagrange and euler and early century took the simultaneous century developments non euclidean geometry and abelian integrals order bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical the first these new developments was seized edmond laguerre and arthur cayley who attempted ascertain the generalized metric properties projective cayley introduced the idea homogeneous polynomial forms and more specifically quadratic forms projective subsequently felix klein studied projective geometry along with other types from the viewpoint that the geometry space encoded certain class transformations the the end the projective geometers were studying more general kinds transformations figures projective rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded giving the fundamental kleinian geometry projective they concerned themselves also with the higher degree birational transformations this weaker notion congruence would later lead members the century italian school algebraic geometry classify algebraic surfaces birational isomorphism the second early century that abelian would lead bernhard riemann the development riemann surfaces the same period began the algebraization the algebraic geometry through commutative algebra the prominent results this direction are david hilbert basis theorem and nullstellensatz which are the basis the connexion between algebraic geometry and commutative and francis sowerby macaulay multivariate resultant which the basis elimination theory probably because the size the computation which implied multivariate elimination theory was forgotten during the middle the century until was renewed singularity theory and computational algebraic century van der waerden oscar zariski and andr weil developed foundation for algebraic geometry based contemporary commutative algebra including valuation theory and the theory ideals one the goals was give rigorous framework for proving the results italian school algebraic geometry this school used systematically the notion generic point without any precise which was first given these authors during the the and jean pierre serre and alexander grothendieck recast the foundations making use sheaf theory later from about and largely lead the idea schemes was worked conjunction with very refined apparatus homological techniques after decade rapid development the field stabilized the and new applications were both number theory and more classical geometric questions algebraic singularities and moduli important class not easily understood directly from their defining are the abelian varieties which are the projective varieties whose points form abelian group the prototypical examples are the elliptic curves which have rich they were instrumental the proof fermat last theorem and are also used elliptic curve cryptography parallel with the abstract trend the algebraic which concerned with general statements about methods for effective computation with given varieties have also been which lead the new area computational algebraic one the founding
