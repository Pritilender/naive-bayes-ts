see also related topics notes references external links history the prehistory arithmetic limited small number artifacts which may indicate the conception addition and the known being the ishango bone from central africa dating from somewhere between and although its interpretation the earliest written records indicate the egyptians and babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations early these artifacts not always reveal the specific process used for solving but the characteristics the particular numeral system strongly influence the complexity the the hieroglyphic system for egyptian numerals like the later roman numerals descended from tally marks used for both this origin resulted values that used decimal base but did not include positional notation complex calculations with roman numerals required the assistance counting board the roman abacus obtain the early number systems that included positional notation were not including the sexagesimal system for babylonian numerals and the vigesimal system that defined maya numerals because this value the ability reuse the same digits for different values contributed simpler and more efficient methods the continuous historical development modern arithmetic starts with the hellenistic civilization ancient although originated much later than the babylonian and egyptian prior the works euclid around greek studies mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical for nicomachus summarized the viewpoint the earlier pythagorean approach and their relationships each his introduction arithmetic greek numerals were used archimedes diophantus and others positional notation not very different from because the ancient greeks lacked symbol for zero until the hellenistic they used three separate sets one set for the one for the and one for the then for the place they would reuse the symbols for the and their addition algorithm was identical and their multiplication algorithm was only very slightly their long division algorithm was the and the square root algorithm that was once taught school was known who may have invented preferred hero method successive approximation once digit and the square roots perfect such terminate immediately for numbers with fractional such they used negative powers instead negative powers for the fractional part the ancient chinese used similar positional because they also lacked symbol for they had one set symbols for the and second set for the for the place they then reused the symbols for the and their symbols were based the ancient counting rods complicated question determine exactly when the chinese started calculating with positional but was definitely before the bishop severus sebokht indians possess method calculation that word can praise their rational system their method mean the system using nine leonardo pisa fibonacci wrote liber abaci the method the indians modus indoram surpasses any known method its marvelous they their computations using nine figures and symbol zero the gradual development hindu arabic numerals independently devised the value concept and positional which combined the simpler methods for computations with decimal base and the use digit representing this allowed the system consistently represent both large and small this approach eventually replaced all other the early century the indian mathematician aryabhata incorporated existing version this system his and experimented with different the brahmagupta established the use separate number and determined the results for division addition and subtraction zero and all other except for the result division his the syriac bishop severus sebokht described the excellence this system valuable methods calculation which surpass the arabs also learned this new method and called hesab stepped reckoner although the codex vigilanus described early form arabic numerals fibonacci was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout europe after the publication his book liber abaci considered the significance this new representation which styled the method the latin modus indorum fundamental that all related mathematical including the results pythagoras and the algorism describing the methods for performing actual were almost the middle ages arithmetic was one the seven liberal arts taught the flourishing algebra the medieval islamic world and renaissance europe was outgrowth the enormous simplification computation through decimal notation various types tools exist assist numeric examples include slide rules for division and and nomographs addition the electrical calculator arithmetic operations operation the basic arithmetic operations are subtraction multiplication and although this subject also includes more advanced such manipulations percentages square roots exponentiation and logarithmic functions arithmetic performed according order operations any set objects upon which all four arithmetic operations except division can and where these four operations obey the usual called field addition addition addition the basic operation its simplest addition combines two the addends terms into single the sum the numbers such adding more than two numbers can viewed repeated this procedure known summation and includes ways add infinitely many numbers infinite series repeated addition the the most basic form counting addition commutative and associative the order the terms are added does not the identity element addition the additive identity that adding any number yields that same also the inverse element addition the additive inverse the opposite any that adding the opposite any number the number itself yields the additive for the opposite addition can given geometrically the following subtraction subtraction subtraction the opposite subtraction finds the difference between two the minuend minus the subtrahend the minuend larger than the the difference the minuend smaller than the the difference they are the difference subtraction neither commutative nor associative for that often helpful look subtraction addition the minuend and the opposite the that when written all the properties addition there are several methods for calculating some which are particularly advantageous machine for digital computers employ the method two complement great importance the counting method which change suppose amount given pay the required amount with greater than rather than performing the subtraction and counting out that amount money counted out starting and continuing until reaching although the amount counted out must equal the result the subtraction the subtraction was never really done and the value might still unknown the method complements multiplication multiplication multiplication the second basic operation multiplication also combines two numbers into single the product the two original numbers are called the multiplier and the multiplicand sometimes both simply called factors multiplication best viewed scaling the numbers are imagined lying multiplication say greater the same stretching everything away uniformly such way that the itself stretched where was similarly multiplying number less can imagined squeezing such way goes the multiplication commutative and further distributive over addition and the multiplicative identity that multiplying any number yields that same also the multiplicative inverse the reciprocal any number the only number without multiplicative that multiplying the reciprocal any number the number itself yields the multiplicative the product and written when are expressions not written simply with also written simple computer programming languages and software packages which one can only use characters normally found often written with division division division essentially the opposite division finds the quotient two the dividend divided the divisor any dividend divided for distinct positive the dividend larger than the the quotient greater otherwise less similar rule applies for negative the quotient multiplied the divisor always yields the division neither commutative nor helpful look subtraction helpful look division multiplication the dividend times the reciprocal the that when written obeys all the properties decimal arithmetic decimal representation refers common the written numeral system employing arabic numerals the digits for radix decimal positional notation however any numeral system based powers greek cyrillic roman chinese numerals may conceptually described decimal decimal modern methods for four fundamental operations subtraction multiplication and were first devised brahmagupta this was known during medieval europe modus method the positional notation also known value refers the representation encoding numbers using the same symbol for the different orders magnitude the ones tens hundreds and with radix point using those same symbols represent fractions the tenths hundredths for denotes hundreds plus tens plus units plus tenths plus hundredths the concept number comparable the other basic digits essential this the concept use and the definition multiplication and addition the use placeholder therefore the use positional notation first attested the jain text from india entitled the lokavibh dated and was only the early century that these transmitted via the scholarship the arabic world were introduced into europe fibonacci using the hindu arabic numeral system algorism comprises all the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type written for addition produces the sum two arbitrary the result calculated the repeated addition single digits from each number that occupies the same proceeding from right addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each individual sum exceeds the the result represented with two the rightmost digit the value for the current and the result for the subsequent addition the digits the left increases the value the second digit which always this adjustment termed carry the the process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers similar the process for multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair individual product pair digits the carry adjustment increases the result any subsequent multiplication from digits the left value equal the second digit which any value from additional steps define the final similar techniques exist for subtraction and the creation correct process for multiplication relies the relationship between values adjacent the value for any single digit numeral depends its also each position the left represents value ten times larger than the position the mathematical the exponent for the radix increases the decreases the therefore the value for any arbitrary digit multiplied value the with integer the list values corresponding all possible positions for single digit written repeated multiplication any value this list produces another value the mathematical this characteristic defined closure and the previous list described closed under multiplication the basis for correctly finding the results multiplication using the previous this outcome one example the uses number theory compound unit arithmetic compound unit arithmetic the application arithmetic operations mixed radix quantities such feet and gallons and pounds shillings and and prior the use based systems money and units the use compound unit arithmetic formed significant part commerce and basic arithmetic operations the techniques used for compound unit arithmetic were developed over many centuries and are documented many textbooks many different addition the basic arithmetic functions encountered decimal compound unit arithmetic employs three more reduction where compound quantity reduced single for example conversion distance expressed feet and inches one expressed expansion the inverse function the conversion quantity that expressed single unit measure compound such expanding normalization the conversion set compound units standard for example rewriting knowledge the relationship between the various units their multiples and their submultiples forms essential part compound unit principles compound unit arithmetic there are two basic approaches compound unit reduction expansion method where all the compound unit variables are reduced single unit the calculation performed and the result expanded back compound this approach suited for automated typical example the handling time microsoft excel where all time intervals are processed internally days and decimal fractions going normalization method which each unit treated separately and the problem continuously normalized the solution this which widely described classical best suited for manual example the going normalization method applied addition shown the addition operation carried out from right this pence are processed then shillings followed the numbers below the answer are intermediate the total the pence column since there are pennies divided with remainder the then written the answer row and the carried forward the shillings this operation repeated using the values the shillings with the additional step adding the value that was carried forward from the pennies the intermediate total divided there are shillings the pound column then but pounds are the largest unit that being values are carried forward from the pounds should noted that for the sake the example chosen did not have operations practice during the and centuries various aids were developed aid the manipulation compound particularly commercial the most common aids were mechanical tills which were adapted countries such the united kingdom accommodate shillings pennies and farthings and ready books aimed traders that catalogued the results various routine calculations such the percentages multiples various sums one typical booklet that ran pages tabulated multiples from one ten thousand the various prices from one farthing one the cumbersome nature compound unit arithmetic has been recognized for many the flemish mathematician simon stevin published small pamphlet called thiende the which declared that the universal introduction decimal measures and weights merely question time while the modern many conversion such that embedded the calculator supplied standard part the microsoft operating system display compound units reduced decimal format rather than using expanded format displayed rather than number theory number theory until number theory was synonym arithmetic the addressed problems were directly related the basic operations and concerned primality divisibility and the solution equations integers such fermat last theorem appeared that most these although very elementary are very difficult and may not solved without very deep mathematics involving concepts and
