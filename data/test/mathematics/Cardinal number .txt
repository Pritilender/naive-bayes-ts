cardinal number navigation search cardinal number aleph null mathematics cardinal numbers cardinals for are generalization the natural numbers used measure the cardinality sets the cardinality finite set natural number the number elements the the transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes infinite sets cardinality defined terms bijective functions two sets have the same cardinality and only there bijection between the case finite this agrees with the intuitive notion the case infinite the behavior more fundamental theorem due georg cantor shows that possible for infinite sets have different and particular the cardinality the set real numbers greater than the cardinality the set natural numbers also possible for proper subset infinite set have the same cardinality the original something that cannot happen with proper subsets finite there transfinite sequence cardinal this sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero finite which are followed the aleph numbers infinite cardinals well ordered sets the aleph numbers are indexed ordinal numbers under the assumption the axiom choice this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal one rejects that the situation more with additional infinite cardinals that are not cardinality studied for its own sake part set theory also tool used branches mathematics including combinatorics abstract algebra and mathematical analysis category theory the cardinal numbers form skeleton the category sets contents history motivation formal definition cardinal arithmetic successor cardinal cardinal addition subtraction cardinal multiplication division cardinal exponentiation roots logarithms the continuum hypothesis see also references external links history the notion now was formulated georg cantor the originator set theory cardinality can used compare aspect finite the sets and are not equal but have the same cardinality namely three this established the existence bijection one between the two cantor applied his concept bijection infinite the set natural numbers thus all sets having bijection with called denumerable countably sets and they all have the same cardinal this cardinal number called aleph null called the cardinal numbers these infinite transfinite cardinal numbers cantor proved that any unbounded subset has the same cardinality even though this might appear run contrary also proved that the set all ordered pairs natural numbers denumerable which implies that the set all rational numbers and later proved that the set all algebraic numbers also each algebraic number may encoded finite sequence integers which are the coefficients the polynomial equation which the the ordered tuple together with pair rationals such that the unique root the polynomial with coefficients that lies the interval his paper cantor proved that there exist order cardinal numbers showing that the set real numbers has cardinality greater than that his original presentation used complex argument with nested intervals but paper proved the same result using his ingenious but simple diagonal argument the new cardinal number the set real numbers called the cardinality the continuum and cantor used the symbol for cantor also developed large portion the general theory cardinal proved that there smallest transfinite cardinal number aleph and that for every cardinal there larger cardinal his continuum hypothesis the proposition that the same this hypothesis has been found independent the standard axioms mathematical set can neither proved nor disproved from the standard motivation informal cardinal number what normally referred counting number provided that they may identified with the natural numbers beginning with the counting numbers are exactly what can defined formally the finite cardinal infinite cardinals only occur level mathematics and more zero number can used for two describe the size describe the position element for finite sets and sequences easy see that these two notions since for every number describing position sequence can construct set which has exactly the right describes the position the sequence and can construct the set which has elements however when dealing with infinite sets essential distinguish between the two the two notions are fact different for infinite considering the position aspect leads ordinal numbers while the size aspect generalized the cardinal numbers described the intuition behind the formal definition cardinal the construction notion the relative size bigness set without reference the kind members which for finite sets this one simply counts the number elements set order compare the sizes larger necessary appeal more subtle set least big set there injective mapping from the elements the elements injective mapping identifies each element the set with unique element the set this most easily understood suppose have the sets and then using this notion size would observe that there which and hence conclude that has cardinality greater than equal note the element has element mapping but this permitted only require injective and not necessarily injective and onto mapping the advantage this notion that can extended infinite can then extend this style two sets and are said have the same cardinality there exists bijection between and the schroeder bernstein theorem this equivalent there being both injective mapping from and injective mapping from then write the cardinal number itself often defined the least ordinal with this called the von neumann cardinal assignment for this definition make must proved that every set has the same cardinality some ordinal this statement the well ordering principle however possible discuss the relative cardinality sets without explicitly assigning names the classic example used that the infinite hotel also called hilbert paradox the grand hotel suppose you are innkeeper hotel with infinite number the hotel and then new guest possible fit the extra guest asking the guest who was room move room the guest room move room and leaving room vacant can explicitly write segment this this way can see that the set has the same cardinality the set since bijection between the first and the second has been this motivates the definition infinite set being any set which has proper subset the same this case proper subset when considering these large might also want see the notion counting order coincides with that cardinal defined above for these infinite happens that considering the above example can see that some object one greater than exists then must have the same cardinality the infinite set started out possible use different formal notion for called ordinals based the ideas counting and considering each number and discover that the notions cardinality and ordinality are divergent once move out the finite can proved that the cardinality the real numbers greater than that the natural numbers just this can visualized using cantor diagonal argument classic questions cardinality for instance the continuum hypothesis are concerned with discovering whether there some cardinal between some pair other infinite more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties larger and larger since cardinality such common concept variety names are sameness cardinality sometimes referred equipotence equipollence equinumerosity thus said that two sets with the same cardinality respectively equipotent equipollent equinumerous formal definition formally assuming the axiom choice the cardinality set the least ordinal such that there bijection between and this definition known the von neumann cardinal assignment the axiom choice not assumed need something the oldest definition the cardinality set implicit cantor and explicit frege and principia mathematica the class all sets that are equinumerous with this does not work zfc other related systems axiomatic set theory because this collection too large for there injection from the universe into mapping set and the axiom limitation size proper the definition does work however type theory and new foundations and related however restrict from this class those equinumerous with that have the least rank then will work this trick due dana scott works because the collection objects with any given rank formally the order among cardinal numbers defined means that there exists injective function from the cantor schroeder theorem states that and then the axiom choice equivalent the statement that given two sets and either set dedekind infinite there exists proper subset with and dedekind finite such subset the finite cardinals are just the natural numbers set finite and only for some natural number any other set infinite assuming the axiom can proved that the dedekind notions correspond the standard can also proved that the cardinal aleph null where aleph the first letter the hebrew alphabet represented the set natural numbers the smallest infinite that any infinite set has subset cardinality the next larger cardinal denoted and for every ordinal there cardinal number and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal cardinal arithmetic can define arithmetic operations cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural can shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural furthermore these operations share many properties with ordinary successor cardinal successor cardinal the axiom choice every cardinal has successor and there are cardinals between and its for finite the successor simply for infinite the successor cardinal differs from the successor ordinal cardinal addition and are disjoint addition given the union and the two sets are not already then they can replaced disjoint sets the same replace and zero additive identity addition associative addition commutative addition decreasing both assuming the axiom addition infinite cardinal numbers either then subtraction assuming the axiom choice given infinite cardinal and cardinal there exists cardinal such that and only will unique and equal and only cardinal multiplication the product cardinals comes from the cartesian product one multiplicative identity multiplication associative multiplication commutative multiplication decreasing both and multiplication distributes over and assuming the axiom multiplication infinite cardinal numbers also either infinite and both are then division assuming the axiom choice given infinite cardinal and zero cardinal there exists cardinal such that and only will unique and equal and only cardinal exponentiation exponentiation given where the set all functions from empty function exponentiation decreasing both note that the cardinality the power set the set and cantor diagonal argument shows that for any set this proves that largest cardinal exists because for any cardinal can always find larger cardinal the class cardinals proper class this proof fails some set notably new foundations all the remaining propositions this section assume the axiom and and least one them then using theorem one can prove and for any infinite cardinal where the cofinality roots assuming the axiom choice given infinite cardinal and finite cardinal greater than the cardinal satisfying will logarithms assuming the axiom choice given infinite cardinal and finite cardinal greater than there may may not cardinal satisfying however such cardinal infinite and less than and any finite cardinality greater than will also satisfy the logarithm infinite cardinal number defined the least cardinal number such that logarithms infinite cardinals are useful some fields for example the study cardinal invariants topological though they lack some the properties that logarithms positive real numbers the continuum hypothesis the continuum hypothesis states that there are cardinals strictly between and the latter cardinal number also often denoted the cardinality the continuum the set real numbers this case the generalized continuum hypothesis states that for every infinite set there are cardinals strictly between and the continuum hypothesis independent the usual axioms set the fraenkel axioms together with the axiom choice zfc see also counting names numbers english large cardinal exclusion principle nominal number ordinal
