that investigates functions complex numbers useful many branches including algebraic geometry number theory applied mathematics well physics including hydrodynamics thermodynamics nuclear aerospace mechanical and electrical engineering murray spiegel described complex analysis one the most beautiful well useful branches complex analysis particularly concerned with analytic functions complex variables more meromorphic functions because the separate real and imaginary parts any analytic function must satisfy laplace equation complex analysis widely applicable dimensional problems physics contents history complex functions holomorphic functions major results see also references external links history mandelbrot set fractal complex analysis one the classical branches mathematics with roots the century and just important mathematicians associated with complex analysis include euler gauss riemann cauchy weierstrass and many more the complex particular the theory conformal mappings has many physical applications and also used throughout analytic number theory modern has become very popular through new boost from complex dynamics and the pictures fractals produced iterating holomorphic functions another important application complex analysis string theory which studies conformal invariants quantum field theory complex functions complex function one which the independent variable and the dependent variable are both complex more complex function function whose domain and range are subsets the complex plane for any complex both the independent variable and the dependent variable may separated into real and imaginary parts other the components the function can interpreted valued functions the two real and the basic concepts complex analysis are often introduced extending the elementary real functions exponential functions logarithmic functions and trigonometric functions into the complex holomorphic functions holomorphic function holomorphic functions are complex functions defined open subset the complex plane that are differentiable complex differentiability has much stronger consequences than usual differentiability for holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable whereas some real differentiable functions are most elementary including the exponential function the trigonometric functions and all polynomial functions are see also analytic function holomorphic sheaf and vector bundles major results one central tool complex analysis the line integral the integral around closed path function that holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded the closed path always this the cauchy integral theorem the values holomorphic function inside disk can computed certain path integral the boundary cauchy integral formula path integrals the complex plane are often used determine complicated real and here the theory residues among others useful see methods contour integration function has pole isolated singularity some that that point where its values blow and have finite then one can compute the residue that these residues can used compute path integrals involving the this the content the powerful residue theorem the remarkable behavior holomorphic functions near essential singularities described picard theorem functions that have only poles but essential singularities are called meromorphic laurent series are similar taylor series but can used study the behavior functions near bounded function that holomorphic the entire complex plane must this liouville theorem can used provide natural and short proof for the fundamental theorem algebra which states that the field complex numbers algebraically closed function holomorphic throughout connected domain then its values are fully determined its values any smaller the function the larger domain said analytically continued from its values the smaller this allows the extension the definition such the riemann zeta function which are initially defined terms infinite sums that converge only limited domains almost the entire complex sometimes the case the natural logarithm impossible analytically continue holomorphic function simply connected domain the complex plane but possible extend holomorphic function closely related surface known riemann surface all this refers complex analysis one there also very rich theory complex analysis more than one complex dimension which the analytic properties such power series expansion carry over whereas most the geometric properties holomorphic functions one complex dimension such conformality not carry the riemann mapping theorem about the conformal relationship certain domains the complex which may the most important result the dimensional fails dramatically higher see also complex dynamics list
