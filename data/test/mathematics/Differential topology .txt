and february mathematics differential topology the field dealing with differentiable functions differentiable manifolds closely related differential geometry and together they make the geometric theory differentiable contents description differential topology versus differential geometry see also notes references external links description differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only smooth structure manifold smooth manifolds are than manifolds with extra geometric which can act obstructions certain types equivalences and deformations that exist differential for volume and riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures the same smooth that one can smoothly flatten certain but might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature the other smooth manifolds are more rigid than the topological manifolds john milnor discovered that some spheres have more than one smooth see exotic sphere and donaldson theorem kervaire exhibited topological manifolds with smooth structure some constructions smooth manifold such the existence tangent can done the topological setting with much more and others one the main topics differential topology the study special kinds smooth mappings between namely immersions and submersions and the intersections submanifolds via transversality more generally one interested properties and invariants smooth manifolds which are carried over diffeomorphisms another special kind smooth morse theory another branch differential which topological information about manifold deduced from changes the rank the jacobian for list differential topology see the following list differential geometry topics differential topology versus differential geometry geometry and topology differential topology and differential geometry are first characterized their similarity they both study primarily the properties differentiable sometimes with variety structures imposed one major difference lies the nature the problems that each subject tries one differential topology distinguishes itself from differential geometry studying primarily those problems which are inherently global consider the example coffee cup and donut see this example from the point view differential the donut and the coffee cup are the same this inherently global though because there way for the differential topologist tell whether the two objects are the same this looking just tiny local piece either she must have access each entire global object from the point view differential the coffee cup and the donut are different because impossible rotate the coffee cup such way that its configuration matches that the this also global way thinking about the but important distinction that the geometer does not need the entire object decide for just tiny piece the can decide that the coffee cup different from the donut because the handle thinner more than any piece the put differential topology studies structures manifolds have interesting local differential geometry studies structures manifolds which have interesting local sometimes even structure more for the problem constructing diffeomorphism between two manifolds the same dimension inherently global since locally two such manifolds are always likewise the problem computing quantity manifold which invariant under differentiable mappings inherently since any local invariant will trivial the sense that already exhibited the topology moreover differential topology does not restrict itself necessarily the study for symplectic topology subbranch differential topology studies global properties symplectic manifolds differential geometry concerns itself with problems which may local global that always have some trivial local thus differential geometry may study differentiable manifolds equipped with connection metric which may riemannian pseudo riemannian finsler special sort distribution such structure and this distinction between differential geometry and differential topology however questions specifically pertaining local diffeomorphism invariants such the tangent space differential topology also deals with questions like which specifically pertain the properties differentiable mappings for example the tangent bundle jet bundles the whitney extension theorem and nevertheless the distinction becomes clearer abstract differential topology the study the local and properties structures manifolds having non trivial local moduli whereas differential geometry the study the local and properties
