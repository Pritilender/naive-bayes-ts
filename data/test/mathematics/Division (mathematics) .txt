division navigation search division divided mathematics especially elementary arithmetic division arithmetic specifically times equals written where not zero then divided equals written for since the expression called the dividend numerator the divisor denominator and the result called the quotient conceptually division integers can viewed either two distinct but related ways quotition and partition partitioning involves taking set size and forming groups that are equal the size each group the quotient and quotition quotative division also sometimes spelled quotitive involves taking set size and forming groups size the number groups this size that can the quotient and both divisions give the same result because multiplication teaching division usually leads the concept fractions being introduced school unlike addition subtraction and multiplication the set all integers not closed under dividing two integers may result remainder complete the division the the number system extended include fractions rational numbers they are more generally contents notation computing manual methods computer with computer assistance properties euclidean division integers rational numbers real numbers zero complex numbers polynomials matrices left and right division pseudoinverse abstract algebra calculus see also references external links notation division often shown algebra and science placing the dividend over the divisor with horizontal also called vinculum fraction between for divided written this can read out loud divided over way express division all one line write the dividend then slash then the divisor like this the usual way specify division most computer programming languages since can easily typed simple sequence ascii characters some mathematical software such gnu octave allows the operands written the reverse order using the backslash the division typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses solidus fraction but elevates the and lowers the any these forms can used display fraction fraction division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers typically called the numerator and denominator and there implication that the division must evaluated second way show division use the obelus division common this this form infrequent except elementary iso states should not the obelus also used alone represent the division operation for instance label key calculator some english speaking divided written this notation was introduced william oughtred his clavis mathematicae and later popularized gottfried wilhelm leibniz however english usage the colon restricted expressing the related concept ratios then elementary classes some the notation used denote divided especially when discussing long division citation needed this notation was first introduced michael stifel arithmetica integra published computing division algorithm manual methods division often introduced through the notion sharing set for example pile into number equal distributing the objects several time each round sharing each portion leads the idea chunking division repeated more systematic and more efficient but also more formalised and more and more removed from overall holistic picture what division person who knows the multiplication tables can divide two integers using pencil and paper using the method short division the divisor long division used for larger integer the dividend has fractional part expressed decimal fraction one can continue the algorithm past the ones place far the divisor has fractional can restate the problem moving the decimal the right both numbers until the divisor has person can calculate division with abacus repeatedly placing the dividend the and then subtracting the divisor the offset each digit the counting the number divisions possible each person can use logarithm tables divide two subtracting the two logarithms then looking the antilogarithm the person can calculate division with slide rule aligning the divisor the scale with the dividend the the quotient can found the scale where aligned with the left index the the user however for mentally keeping track the decimal computer with computer assistance modern computers compute division methods that are faster than long see division algorithm modular arithmetic some numbers have multiplicative inverse with respect the can calculate division multiplication such this approach useful computers that not have fast division properties division distributive over addition and that the same way multiplication but unlike euclidean division euclidean division the euclidean division the mathematical formulation the outcome the usual process division asserts given two the dividend and the divisor such that there are unique integers the quotient and the such that and where denotes the absolute value integers division integers not closed apart from division zero being the quotient not integer unless the dividend integer multiple the for example cannot divided give such case uses one five say that cannot divided division becomes partial function give approximate answer decimal fraction mixed number this the approach usually taken numerical computation give the answer fraction representing rational number the result the division but usually the resulting fraction should the result the division also this simplification may done factoring out the greatest common divisor give the answer integer quotient and remainder make the distinction with the previous this with two integers sometimes called euclidean division because the basis the euclidean algorithm give the integer quotient the this sometimes called integer division dividing integers computer program requires special some programming languages such treat integer division case above the answer other such matlab and every computer algebra system return rational number the case above these languages also provide functions get the results the other either directly from the result case names and symbols used for integer division include and definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend the divisor rounding may toward zero called toward rarer styles can occur see modulo operation for the divisibility rules can sometimes used quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into rational numbers the result dividing two rational numbers another rational number when the divisor not may define division two rational numbers and all four quantities are and only may this definition ensures that division the inverse operation multiplication real numbers division two real numbers results another real number when the divisor not defined such and only and zero division zero division any number zero where the divisor this because zero multiplied any finite number always results product entry such expression into most calculators produces error complex numbers dividing two complex numbers results another complex number when the divisor not defined all four quantities are real and may not both division for complex numbers expressed polar form simpler than the definition again all four quantities are real may not polynomials one can define the division operation for polynomials one variable over field then the case one has see euclidean division polynomials and for written polynomial long division synthetic division matrices one can define division operation for the usual way this define where denotes the inverse but far more common write out explicitly avoid left and right division because matrix multiplication not commutative one can also define left division called backslash division for this well need not however does need avoid division defined sometimes called right division slash division this note that with left and right division defined this general not the same and nor the same but and pseudoinverse avoid problems when and not division can also defined multiplication with the pseudoinverse and where and denote the pseudoinverse and abstract algebra abstract algebras such matrix algebras and quaternion algebras fractions such are typically defined where presumed invertible element there exists multiplicative inverse such that where the multiplicative integral domain where such elements may not division can still performed equations the form left right respectively more generally division the sense cancellation can done any ring with the aforementioned cancellation such ring then application the pigeonhole principle every nonzero element the ring division any nonzero element possible such learn about when algebras the technical have division refer the page division algebras particular bott periodicity can used show that any real normed division algebra must isomorphic either the real numbers the complex numbers the quaternions the octonions calculus the derivative the quotient two functions given the quotient rule there general method integrate the quotient two see also sunzi division algorithm division two field fraction galley division group inverse element order operations quasigroup left repeating decimal
