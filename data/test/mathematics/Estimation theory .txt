estimation theory navigation search estimation estimation theory branch statistics that deals with estimating the values parameters based empirical data that has random the parameters describe underlying physical setting such way that their value affects the distribution the measured estimator attempts approximate the unknown parameters using the for desired estimate the proportion population voters who will vote for particular that proportion the parameter the estimate based small random sample for radar the goal estimate the range objects boats etc analyzing the way transit timing received echoes transmitted since the reflected pulses are unavoidably embedded electrical their measured values are randomly that the transit time must estimation two approaches are generally the probabilistic approach described this assumes that the measured data random with probability distribution dependent the parameters interest the set membership approach assumes that the measured data vector belongs set which depends the parameter for electrical communication the measurements which contain information regarding the parameters interest are often associated with noisy signal without the problem would deterministic and estimation would not contents basics estimators examples unknown constant additive white gaussian noise maximum likelihood cram rao lower bound maximum uniform distribution applications see also notes references references basics build several statistical ingredients need these are needed ensure the estimator has some mathematical the first set statistical samples taken from random vector size put into vector secondly there are the corresponding parameters which need established with their continuous probability density function its discrete the probability mass function also possible for the parameters themselves have probability distribution bayesian statistics then necessary define the bayesian probability after the model the goal estimate the commonly denoted where the hat indicates the one common estimator the minimum mean squared error estimator which utilizes the error between the estimated parameters and the actual value the parameters the basis for this error term then squared and minimized for the mmse estimators estimator commonly used estimators and estimation and topics related maximum likelihood estimators bayes estimators method moments estimators rao bound minimum mean squared error also known bayes least squared error maximum posteriori minimum variance unbiased estimator nonlinear system identification best linear unbiased estimator unbiased estimators see estimator bias particle filter markov chain monte carlo kalman filter and its various derivatives wiener filter examples unknown constant additive white gaussian noise consider received discrete signal independent samples that consists unknown constant with additive white gaussian noise with known variance since the variance known then the only unknown parameter the model for the signal then two possible estimators which the sample mean both these estimators have mean which can shown through taking the expected value each estimator and this these two estimators would appear perform the however the difference between them becomes apparent when comparing the and would seem that the sample mean better estimator since its variance lower for maximum likelihood maximum likelihood continuing the example using the maximum likelihood estimator the probability density function the noise for one sample and the probability becomes can thought the probability becomes taking the natural logarithm the pdf and the maximum likelihood estimator taking the first derivative the likelihood function and setting zero this results the maximum likelihood estimator which simply the sample from this was found that the sample mean the maximum likelihood estimator for samples unknown parameter corrupted cram rao lower bound cram rao bound find the cram rao lower bound the sample mean first necessary find the fisher information number and copying from above taking the second derivative and finding the negative expected value trivial since now deterministic constant finally putting the fisher information into results comparing this the variance the sample mean determined shows that the sample mean equal the rao lower bound for all values and other the sample mean the necessarily efficient estimator and thus also the minimum variance unbiased estimator addition being the maximum likelihood estimator maximum uniform distribution german tank problem one the simplest trivial examples estimation the estimation the maximum uniform used classroom exercise and illustrate basic principles estimation further the case estimation based single demonstrates philosophical issues and possible misunderstandings the use maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood functions given discrete uniform distribution with unknown the umvu estimator for the maximum given where the sample maximum and the sample size sampling without this problem commonly known the german tank problem due application maximum estimation estimates german tank production during world war the formula may understood intuitively the gap being added compensate for the negative bias the sample maximum estimator for the population note this has variance standard deviation approximately the average size gap between compare above this can seen very simple case maximum spacing estimation the sample maximum the maximum likelihood estimator for the population but discussed applications numerous fields require the use estimation some these fields include but are means limited interpretation scientific experiments signal processing clinical trials
