with the property that each input related exactly one example the function that relates each real number its square the output function corresponding input denoted read this the input then the output and may write the input are sometimes referred the the functions various kinds are the central objects most fields modern there are many ways describe represent some functions may defined formula algorithm that tells how compute the output for given others are given called the graph the function functions are sometimes defined table that gives the outputs for selected function could described for example the inverse another function solution differential equation the input and output function can expressed ordered pair ordered that the first element the input tuple the function takes more than one and the second the the example have the ordered pair both input and output are real this ordered pair can viewed the cartesian coordinates point the graph the but picture can exactly define every point infinite modern function defined its set called the domain set containing the set and possibly additional called its codomain and the set all output called its graph sometimes the codomain called the range but warning the word range sometimes used instead specifically the set unambiguous word for the latter meaning the image avoid the words codomain and image are the preferred language for their for could define function using the rule saying that the domain and codomain are the real numbers and that the graph consists all pairs real numbers collections functions with the same domain and the same codomain are called function spaces the properties which are studied such mathematical disciplines real analysis complex analysis and functional analysis analogy with arithmetic possible define subtraction multiplication and division those cases where the output another important operation defined functions function composition where the output from one function becomes the

external links introduction and examples for example let the set consisting four red yellow green and red and let the set consisting five red blue green pink and linking each shape its color function from each shape linked color element and each shape linked mapped exactly one there shape that lacks color and shape that has two more this function will referred the shape the input function called the argument and the output called the value the set all permitted inputs given function called the domain the while the set permissible outputs called the codomain thus the domain the shape the set the four and the codomain consists the five the concept function does not require that every possible output the value some the color blue not the color any the four shapes second example function the the domain chosen the set natural numbers and the codomain the set integers the function associates any natural number the number for associates and associates third example function has the set polygons domain and the set natural numbers the function associates polygon with its number vertices for triangle associated with the number square with the number and the term range sometimes used either for the codomain for the set all the actual values function avoid ambiguity this article avoids using the definition not order avoid the use the informally defined concepts rules and associates the above intuitive explanation functions completed with formal this definition relies the notion the cartesian product the cartesian product two sets and the set all ordered pairs written where element and element the and the are called the components the ordered the cartesian product and denoted function from subset the cartesian product subject the following every element the first component one and only one ordered pair the other for every there exactly one element such that the ordered pair contained the subset defining the function this formal definition precise rendition the idea that each associated element namely the uniquely specified element with the property just considering the function the set the domain consisting the four while the codomain consisting five there are twenty possible ordered pairs four shapes times five one which the function described above consists the set those ordered where the color the actual color the given thus the pair red red the but the pair yellow red notation functional notation function with domain and codomain commonly denoted this the elements are called arguments for each argument the corresponding unique the codomain called the function value the image under written one says that associates with maps this abbreviated general function often denoted special functions have for the signum function denoted given real number its image under the signum function then written here the argument denoted the symbol but different symbols may used other for the velocity some depending the denoted the parentheses around the argument may omitted when there little chance thus sin this known prefix notation order denote specific the notation arrow with bar its for the above function reads the first part can read function from the set natural the set valued function valued the second part maps other this function has the natural numbers the integers strictly function properly defined only when the domain and codomain are for the formula alone without specifying the codomain and not properly defined moreover the function with different not considered the same even though the formulas defining and agree and similarly with different despite many authors drop the specification the domain and especially these are clear from the this example many just write sometimes the maximal possible domain also understood formula such may mean that the domain the set real numbers where the square root defined this case define sometimes dot notation used order emphasize the functional nature expression without assigning special symbol the for stands for the function stands for the integral function and specifying function function can defined any mathematical condition relating each argument input the corresponding output the domain function may defined simply tabulating all the arguments and their corresponding function values more function defined formula more algorithm recipe that tells how compute the value given any the there are many other ways defining examples include piecewise definitions induction recursion algebraic analytic closure limits analytic continuation infinite series and solutions integral and differential equations the lambda calculus provides powerful and flexible syntax for defining and combining functions several advanced some functions exist because axiom such the axiom choice graph the graph function its set ordered pairs this abstraction the idea graph picture showing the function plotted pair coordinate for the point above the horizontal axis and the right the vertical lies the graph formulas and algorithms different formulas algorithms may describe the same for instance exactly the same function furthermore function need not described expression nor need deal with numbers the domain and codomain function may arbitrary sets one example function that acts numeric inputs takes english words inputs and returns the first letter the input word the factorial function defined the nonnegative integers and produces nonnegative defined the following inductive defined and defined for all positive integers the factorial function denoted with the exclamation mark serving the symbol the after the variable postfix notation computability computable function functions that send integers finite strings finite can sometimes defined algorithm which gives precise description set steps for computing the output the function from its functions definable algorithm are called computable functions for the euclidean algorithm gives precise process compute the greatest common divisor two positive many the functions studied the context number theory are fundamental results computability theory show that there are functions that can precisely defined but are not moreover the sense cardinality almost all functions from the integers integers are not the number computable functions from integers integers countable because the number possible algorithms the number all functions from integers integers the same the cardinality the real numbers thus most functions from integers integers are not specific examples uncomputable functions are including the busy beaver function and functions related the halting problem and other undecidable problems basic properties there are number general basic properties and this function with domain and codomain image and preimage image interval any subset the domain then the subset the codomain consisting all images elements say the the image under the image given the other the inverse image preimage complete inverse image subset the codomain under function the subset the domain defined for the preimage under the squaring function the set the term range usually refers the but sometimes refers the definition the image element the domain always single element the conversely though the preimage singleton set set with exactly one may general contain any number for the constant function taking value then the preimage the empty set but the preimage the entire customary write instead this set sometimes called the fiber under use denote the image subset consistent long subset the domain also element the some fields set where ordinals are also sets convenient even necessary distinguish the two the customary notation for the set likewise some authors use square brackets avoid confusion between the inverse image and the inverse thus they would write and for the preimage set and injective and surjective functions function called injective one one for any two different elements and the called surjective onto that surjective for every element the codomain there the domain such that finally called bijective both injective and this nomenclature was introduced the bourbaki group the above function not since two distinct shapes the red triangle and the red are assigned the same moreover not since the image the function contains only but not all five colors the function composition function composition the function composition two functions takes the output one function the input second more the composition with function the function defined that the value obtained first applying obtain and then applying obtain the notation the function the acts first and the function the acts reversing english reading the notation can memorized reading the notation after the composition only defined when the codomain the domain assuming the composition the opposite order need not even the codomain the codomain not general true that that the order the composition for suppose and then while which different identity function identity function the unique function over set that maps each element itself called the identity function for and typically denoted each set has its own identity the subscript cannot omitted unless the set can inferred from under identity function neutral any function from then restrictions and extensions restriction informally restriction function the result trimming its more any subset the restriction the function from such that for all restriction then said that extension the overriding also called overriding union extension denoted its graph the theoretical union the graphs and thus relates any element the domain its image under and any other element the domain its image under overriding associative operation has the empty function identity element and are pointwise equal the domains and are then the union and defined and equal their overriding this definition agrees with the definition union for binary relations inverse function inverse function inverse function for denoted function the opposite from satisfying that the two possible compositions and need the respective identity maps and simple converts temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit the function converting degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius would suitable such inverse function exists and only this called the notation some just and are akin multiplication and reciprocal with this identity functions are like the multiplicative identity and inverse functions are like reciprocals hence the types functions real valued functions valued function one whose codomain the set real numbers subset thereof the domain also subset the real valued function real the study such functions called real analysis real valued functions enjoy called pointwise that given two functions where subset the reals and arbitrary their sum and product are functions with the same domain and they are defined the similar complex analysis studies functions whose domain and codomain are both the set complex numbers most the domain and codomain are understood from and only the relationship between the input and output but then real variables the domain limited negative the following table contains few particularly important types valued affine functions quadratic function continuous function trigonometric function signum function further types functions list mathematical functions there are many other special classes functions that are important particular branches particular here partial differentiable integrable polynomial rational algebraic transcendental odd even convex monotonic holomorphic meromorphic entire valued computable function spaces function space the set all functions from set set denoted the latter notation motivated the fact when and are finite and size and then the number functions this example the convention from enumerative combinatorics that provides notations for sets based their infinite and there more than one element then there are uncountably many functions from though only countably many them can expressed with formula currying currying alternative approach handling functions with multiple arguments transform them into chain functions that each takes single for one can interpret mean first produce function that adds its and then apply the add function this transformation called currying add applied there bijection between the function spaces and when working with curried functions customary use prefix notation with function application considered since juxtaposition multiple naturally maps evaluation curried conversely the and symbols are considered that curried functions may defined notation such variants and generalizations alternative definition function the above definition function from generally agreed citation needed however there are two different ways function normally defined where the domain and codomain are not explicitly implicitly usually this not problem the domain and codomain normally will with one definition saying the function defined the reals does not completely specify function the codomain not and the other valid the other definition function defined set ordered pairs where each first element only occurs the domain the set all the first elements pair and there explicit codomain separate from the concepts like surjective have refined for such more specifically saying that function surjective set its image equals that for might say function surjective the set real function defined set ordered pairs with specific then indicates that function whose domain and whose image subset this the case the iso may referred the codomain but then any set including the image valid codomain this also referred saying that maps into some usages and may subset the ordered the function the real numbers such that when used means the function defined only the interval with the definition function ordered triple this would always considered partial function alternative definition the composite function defines for the set all the domain such that the domain thus the real square root function only defined where has the value functions are commonly defined type relation relation from set ordered pairs with and function from can described relation from that total and however when and are not specified there disagreement about the definition relation that parallels that for normally relation just defined set ordered pairs and correspondence defined triple however the distinction between the two often blurred relation never referred without specifying the two the definition function triple defines function type whereas the definition function set ordered pairs defines function type many operations set such the power set have the class all sets their and although they are informally described they not fit the theoretical definition outlined because class not necessarily however some definitions relations and functions define them classes pairs rather than sets pairs and therefore include the power set partial and valued functions square root some parts including recursion theory and functional analysis convenient study partial functions which some values the domain have association the single valued for the function such that does not define value for since division zero not hence only partial function from the real line the real the term total function can used stress the fact that every element the domain does appear the first element ordered pair the other parts non valued relations are similarly conflated with these are called multivalued functions with the corresponding term single valued function for ordinary functions with multiple inputs and outputs the concept function can extended object that takes combination two argument values single this intuitive concept formalized function whose domain the cartesian product two more for consider the function that associates two integers their this function can defined formally having domain the set all integer codomain and for the set all pairs note that the first component any such pair itself pair while the second component single the function value the pair however customary drop one set parentheses and consider function two and functions two variables may plotted the dimensional cartesian ordered triples the form the concept can still further extended considering function that also produces output that expressed several for consider the integer divide with domain and codomain the resultant remainder pair single value the codomain seen cartesian binary operations the familiar binary operations arithmetic addition and multiplication can viewed functions from this view generalized abstract algebra where ary functions are used model the operations arbitrary algebraic for abstract group defined set and function from that satisfies certain traditionally addition and multiplication are written the infix notation and instead and functors the idea structure preserving homomorphisms led the abstract notion morphism the key concept category theory functions are the morphisms the category sets including the empty the domain the empty set then the subset describing the function necessarily too however this still defined such function called empty function the identity function the empty set requirement for sets form the concept categorification attempt replace theoretic notions theoretic according this sets are replaced while functions between sets are replaced functors
