galois certain problems field theory can reduced group which some sense simpler and better originally galois used permutation groups describe how the various roots given polynomial equation are related each the modern approach galois developed richard dedekind leopold kronecker and emil artin among involves studying automorphisms field extensions further abstraction galois theory achieved the theory galois connections contents application classical problems history permutation group approach galois theory first quadratic equation second example modern approach field theory solvable groups and solution radicals solvable quintic example inverse galois problem see also notes references external links application classical problems the birth galois theory was originally motivated the following whose answer known the abel ruffini theorem why there formula for the roots fifth degree polynomial equation terms the coefficients the using only the usual algebraic operations subtraction multiplication division and application radicals square cube etc galois theory not only provides beautiful answer this also explains detail why possible solve equations degree four lower the above and why their solutions take the form that they further gives conceptually and often means telling when some particular equation higher degree can solved that galois theory also gives clear insight into questions concerning problems compass and straightedge construction gives elegant characterisation the ratios lengths that can constructed with this using becomes relatively easy answer such classical problems geometry which regular polygons are constructible polygons why not possible trisect every angle using compass and straightedge history abstract algebra early group theory galois theory originated the study symmetric functions the coefficients monic polynomial are the elementary symmetric polynomials the for where and are the elementary polynomials degree and two this was first formalized the century french mathematician fran ois formulas for the case positive real the opinion the century british mathematician charles hutton the expression coefficients polynomial terms the roots not only for positive was first understood the century french mathematician albert girard hutton girard the first person who understood the general doctrine the formation the coefficients the powers from the sum the roots and their was the first who discovered the rules for summing the powers the roots any this the discriminant symmetric function the roots that reflects properties the roots zero and only the polynomial has multiple and for quadratic and cubic polynomials positive and only all roots are real and and negative and only there pair distinct complex conjugate see discriminant nature the roots for the cubic was first partly solved the century italian mathematician scipione del ferro who did not however publish his this method only solved one three the others involved taking square roots negative and complex numbers were not known the this solution was then rediscovered independently niccol fontana tartaglia who shared with gerolamo cardano asking him not publish cardano then extended this the other two using square roots negatives intermediate see details cardano method after the discovery felt that method was longer and thus published his complete solution his ars magna his student lodovico ferrari solved the quartic his solution was also included ars further step was the paper flexions sur solution brique des quations the italian mathematician joseph louis lagrange his method lagrange resolvents where analyzed cardano and solution cubics and quartics considering them terms permutations the which yielded auxiliary polynomial lower providing unified understanding the solutions and laying the groundwork for group theory and galois crucially however did not consider composition lagrange method did not extend quintic equations because the resolvent had higher the quintic was almost proven have general solutions radicals paolo ruffini whose key insight was use permutation groups not just single his solution contained which cauchy considered though this was not patched until the work norwegian mathematician niels henrik abel who published proof thus establishing the abel ruffini theorem while ruffini and abel established that the general quintic could not some particular quintics can such and the precise criterion which given quintic higher polynomial could determined solvable not was given variste galois who showed that whether polynomial was solvable not was equivalent whether not the permutation group its roots modern its galois group had certain structure modern whether not was solvable group this group was always solvable for polynomials degree four but not always for polynomials degree five and which explains why there general solution higher permutation group approach galois theory given may that some the roots are connected various algebraic equations for may that for two the say and that the central idea galois theory consider those permutations the roots having the property that any algebraic equation satisfied the roots still satisfied after the roots have been important proviso that restrict ourselves algebraic equations whose coefficients are rational numbers one might instead specify certain field which the coefficients should lie for the simple examples will restrict ourselves the field rational these permutations together form permutation group also called the galois group the polynomial over the rational illustrate this consider the following first quadratic equation consider the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula find that the two roots are examples algebraic equations satisfied and include and either these exchange and obtain another true for the equation becomes simply furthermore but far less that this holds for every possible algebraic equation with rational coefficients relating the and values above any such swapping and yields another true prove this requires the theory symmetric polynomials one might object that and are related the algebraic equation which does not remain true when and are however this equation does not concern because has the coefficient which not rational conclude that the galois group the polynomial consists two the identity permutation which leaves and untouched and the transposition permutation which exchanges and cyclic group order and therefore isomorphic similar discussion applies any quadratic polynomial where and are rational the polynomial has only one for example then the galois group that contains only the identity has two distinct rational roots for example the galois group again has two irrational roots including the case where the roots are complex then the galois group contains two just the above second example consider the polynomial which can also written wish describe the galois group this again over the field rational numbers the polynomial has four there are possible ways permute these four but not all these permutations are members the galois the members the galois group must preserve any algebraic equation with rational coefficients involving and among these follows permutation that belongs the galois must this implies that the permutation well defined the image that the galois group has elements which are and the galois group isomorphic the klein group modern approach field theory the modern one starts with field extension over and examines the group field automorphisms these are bijective ring homomorphisms such that for all see the article galois groups for further explanation and the connection between the two approaches the coefficients the polynomial question should chosen from the base field the top field should the field obtained adjoining the roots the polynomial question the base any permutation the roots which respects algebraic equations described above gives rise automorphism and vice the first example were studying the extension where the field rational numbers and the field obtained from adjoining the second were studying the extension there are several advantages the modern approach over the permutation group permits far simpler statement the fundamental theorem galois theory the use base fields other than crucial many areas for algebraic number theory one often does galois theory using number fields finite fields local fields the base allows one more easily study infinite again this important algebraic number where for example one often discusses the absolute galois group defined the galois group where algebraic closure allows for consideration inseparable extensions this issue does not arise the classical since was always implicitly assumed that arithmetic took place characteristic zero but nonzero characteristic arises frequently number theory and algebraic geometry removes the rather artificial reliance chasing roots that different polynomials may yield the same extension and the modern approach recognizes the connection between these solvable groups and solution radicals the notion solvable group group theory allows one determine whether polynomial solvable depending whether its galois group has the property each field extension corresponds factor group composition series the galois factor group the composition series cyclic order and the corresponding field extension the field already contains primitive root unity then radical extension and the elements can then expressed using the root some element all the factor groups its composition series are the galois group called solvable and all the elements the corresponding field can found repeatedly taking products and sums elements from the base field usually one the great triumphs galois theory was the proof that for every there exist polynomials degree which are not solvable the abel ruffini theorem this due the fact that for the symmetric group contains simple non normal subgroup namely the alternating group complex numbers solvable quintic example van der waerden cites the polynomial the rational root theorem this has rational neither does have linear factors modulo the galois group modulo cyclic order because factors modulo into and cubic has linear quadratic factor modulo and hence irreducible modulo thus its galois group modulo contains element order known that galois group modulo prime isomorphic subgroup the galois group over the permutation group objects with elements orders and must the symmetric group which therefore the galois group this one the simplest examples solvable quintic according serge lang emil artin found this inverse galois problem inverse galois problem all finite groups occur galois easy construct field extensions with any given finite group galois long one does not also specify the ground field for choose field and finite group cayley theorem says that subgroup the symmetric group the elements choose indeterminates one for each element and adjoin them get the field contained within the field symmetric rational functions the the galois group basic result emil acts restriction action the fixed field this action then the fundamental theorem galois theory the galois group open problem prove the existence field extension the rational field with given finite group galois hilbert played part solving the problem for all symmetric and alternating igor shafarevich proved that every solvable finite group the galois group some extension various people have solved the inverse galois problem for selected abelian simple groups existence solutions has been shown for all but possibly one mathieu group the sporadic simple there even polynomial with integral coefficients whose galois group the monster group see also reed solomon error correction differential galois theory galois theory
