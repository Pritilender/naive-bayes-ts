with elements formal mathematical science emerging the west early thales century the century geometry was put into axiomatic form euclid whose euclidean geometry set standard for many centuries archimedes developed ingenious techniques for calculating areas and many ways anticipating modern integral calculus the field astronomy especially relates mapping the positions stars and planets the celestial sphere and describing the relationship between movements celestial served important source geometric problems during the next one and half the classical both geometry and astronomy were considered part the quadrivium subset the seven liberal arts considered essential for free citizen the introduction coordinates ren descartes and the concurrent developments algebra marked new stage for since geometric figures such plane curves could now represented analytically the form functions and this played key role the emergence infinitesimal calculus the furthermore the theory perspective showed that there more geometry than just the metric properties perspective the origin projective geometry the subject geometry was further enriched the study the intrinsic structure geometric objects that originated with euler and gauss and led the creation topology and differential geometry there was clear distinction between physical and geometrical since the century discovery non euclidean geometry the concept space has undergone radical transformation and raised the question which geometrical space best fits physical with the rise formal mathematics the whether lost its intuitive today have distinguish between physical geometrical spaces which etc still have their intuitive and abstract contemporary geometry considers manifolds spaces that are considerably more abstract than the familiar euclidean space which they only approximately resemble small these spaces may endowed with additional structure which allow one speak about modern geometry has many ties physics exemplified the links between pseudo riemannian geometry and general relativity one the youngest physical string theory also very geometric while the visual nature geometry makes initially more accessible than

circumference and area area triangle volume cylinder sphere and pyramid method computing certain inaccessible distances heights based similarity geometric figures attributed thales the development astronomy led the emergence trigonometry and spherical trigonometry together with the attendant computational axiomatic geometry parallel postulate euclidean geometry euclid took more abstract approach his elements one the most influential books ever euclid introduced certain axioms postulates expressing primary evident properties lines and proceeded rigorously deduce other properties mathematical the characteristic feature approach geometry was its and has come known axiomatic synthetic geometry the start the the discovery non euclidean geometries gauss lobachevsky bolyai and others led revival interest this and the david hilbert employed axiomatic reasoning attempt provide modern foundation geometric constructions compass and straightedge constructions classical geometers paid special attention constructing geometric objects that had been described some other classically the only instruments allowed geometric constructions are the compass and straightedge also every construction had complete finite number however some problems turned out difficult impossible solve these means and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other well mechanical were numbers geometry incommensurable ancient greece the pythagoreans considered the role numbers however the discovery incommensurable which contradicted their philosophical made them abandon abstract numbers favor concrete geometric such length and area numbers were reintroduced into geometry the form coordinates descartes who realized that the study geometric shapes can facilitated their algebraic and whom the cartesian plane analytic geometry applies methods algebra geometric typically relating geometric curves algebraic equations these ideas played key role the development calculus the century and led the discovery many new properties plane modern algebraic geometry considers similar questions vastly more abstract geometry position projective geometry topology even ancient geometers considered questions relative position spatial relationship geometric figures and some examples are given inscribed and circumscribed circles polygons lines intersecting and tangent conic sections the pappus and menelaus configurations points and the middle new and more complicated questions this type were what the maximum number spheres simultaneously touching given sphere the same radius kissing number problem what the densest packing spheres equal size space kepler conjecture most these questions involved geometrical such lines projective convex and discrete geometry are three disciplines within present day geometry that deal with these types leonhard euler studying problems like the seven bridges nigsberg considered the most fundamental properties geometric figures based solely independent their metric euler called this new branch geometry geometria situs geometry but now known topology topology grew out but turned into large independent does not differentiate between objects that can continuously deformed into each the objects may nevertheless retain some the case hyperbolic knots geometry beyond euclid differential geometry calculus the nearly two thousand years since while the range geometrical questions asked and answered inevitably the basic understanding space remained essentially the immanuel kant argued that there only absolute geometry which known true priori inner faculty euclidean geometry was synthetic priori this dominant view was overturned the revolutionary discovery non euclidean geometry the works bolyai lobachevsky and gauss who never published his they demonstrated that ordinary euclidean space only one possibility for development broad vision the subject geometry was then expressed riemann his inauguration lecture ber die welche der geometrie grunde liegen the hypotheses which geometry based published only after his riemann new idea space proved crucial einstein general relativity theory and riemannian geometry which considers very general spaces which the notion length mainstay modern dimension where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions line plane and our ambient world conceived three dimensional space mathematicians have used higher dimensions for nearly two dimension has gone through stages being any natural number possibly infinite with the introduction hilbert space and any positive real number fractal geometry dimension theory technical initially within general topology that discusses definitions common with most mathematical dimension now defined rather than connected topological manifolds have defined this theorem invariance domain rather than anything priori the issue dimension still matters the absence complete answers classic dimensions space and space time are special cases geometric topology dimension key number string theory research may bring satisfactory geometric reason for the significance and dimensions symmetry tiling hyperbolic plane the theme symmetry geometry nearly old the science geometry symmetric shapes such the circle regular polygons and platonic solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated detail before the time symmetric patterns occur nature and were artistically rendered multitude including the graphics escher nonetheless was not until the second half century that the unifying role symmetry foundations geometry was felix klein erlangen program proclaimed very precise symmetry expressed via the notion transformation group determines what geometry symmetry classical euclidean geometry represented congruences and rigid whereas projective geometry analogous role played collineations geometric transformations that take straight lines into straight however was the new geometries bolyai and riemann clifford and and sophus lie that idea define geometry via its symmetry group proved most both discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles the former topology and geometric group theory the latter lie theory and riemannian geometry different type symmetry the principle duality projective geometry see duality projective among other this phenomenon can roughly described any theorem exchange point with plane join with meet lies with contains and you will get equally true similar and closely related form duality exists between vector space and its dual history geometry history geometry european arab the earliest recorded beginnings geometry can traced ancient mesopotamia and egypt the millennium early geometry was collection empirically discovered principles concerning angles areas and which were developed meet some practical need surveying construction astronomy and various the earliest known texts geometry are the egyptian rhind papyrus and moscow papyrus the babylonian clay tablets such plimpton for the moscow papyrus gives formula for calculating the volume truncated frustum south egypt the ancient nubians established system geometry including early versions sun the century the greek mathematician thales miletus used geometry solve problems such calculating the height pyramids and the distance ships from the credited with the first use deductive reasoning applied deriving four corollaries thales theorem pythagoras established the pythagorean school which credited with the first proof the pythagorean theorem though the statement the theorem has long history eudoxus developed the method exhaustion which allowed the calculation areas and volumes curvilinear well theory ratios that avoided the problem incommensurable magnitudes which enabled subsequent geometers make significant around geometry was revolutionized whose elements widely considered the most successful and influential textbook all introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and the earliest example the format still used mathematics that axiom theorem and although most the contents the elements were already euclid arranged them into coherent logical the elements was known all educated people the west until the middle the century and its contents are still taught geometry classes archimedes syracuse used the method exhaustion calculate the area under the arc parabola with the summation infinite series and gave remarkably accurate approximations also studied the spiral bearing his name and obtained formulas for the volumes surfaces revolution woman teaching geometry elements indian mathematicians also made many important contributions the satapatha brahmana ninth century contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar the sulba sutras according hayashi the ulba tras contain the earliest extant verbal expression the pythagorean theorem the although had already been known the old they contain lists pythagorean triples which are particular cases diophantine equations the bakhshali manuscript there handful geometric problems including problems about volumes irregular the bakhshali manuscript also employs decimal place value system with dot for aryabhata aryabhatiya includes the computation areas and brahmagupta wrote his astronomical work hma nta chapter containing sanskrit verses was divided into two basic including cube fractions ratio and and and practical including mathematical plane stacking sawing and piling the latter stated his famous theorem the diagonals cyclic quadrilateral chapter also included formula for the area cyclic quadrilateral generalization heron formula well complete description rational triangles triangles with rational sides and rational the middle ages mathematics medieval islam contributed the development especially algebraic geometry and geometric algebra mahani conceived the idea reducing geometrical problems such duplicating the cube problems bit ibn qurra known thebit latin dealt with arithmetic operations applied ratios geometrical and contributed the development analytic geometry omar found geometric solutions cubic equations the theorems ibn haytham omar khayyam and nasir din tusi quadrilaterals including the lambert quadrilateral and saccheri quadrilateral were early results hyperbolic geometry and along with their alternative such playfair axiom these works had considerable influence the development euclidean geometry among later european including witelo gersonides alfonso john wallis and giovanni girolamo saccheri the early there were two important developments the first was the creation analytic geometry with coordinates and equations ren descartes and pierre fermat this was necessary precursor the development calculus and precise quantitative science physics the second geometric development this period was the systematic study projective geometry girard desargues projective geometry geometry without measurement parallel just the study how points are related each two developments geometry the century changed the way had been studied these were the discovery non euclidean geometries nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky nos bolyai and carl friedrich gauss and the formulation symmetry the central consideration the erlangen programme felix klein which generalized the euclidean and euclidean two the master geometers the time were bernhard riemann working primarily with tools from mathematical analysis and introducing the riemann surface and henri the founder algebraic topology and the geometric theory dynamical systems consequence these major changes the conception the concept space became something rich and and the natural background for theories different complex analysis and classical mechanics contemporary geometry euclidean geometry polytope lie group coxeter plane euclidean geometry has become closely connected with computational geometry computer graphics convex geometry incidence geometry finite geometry discrete geometry and some areas combinatorics attention was given further work euclidean geometry and the euclidean groups crystallography and the work coxeter and can seen theories coxeter groups and geometric group theory expanding area the theory more general discrete groups drawing geometric models and algebraic differential geometry differential geometry has been increasing importance mathematical physics due einstein general relativity postulation that the universe curved contemporary differential geometry intrinsic meaning that the spaces considers are smooth manifolds whose geometric structure governed riemannian metric which determines how distances are measured near each and not priori parts some ambient flat euclidean topology and geometry trefoil knot the field
