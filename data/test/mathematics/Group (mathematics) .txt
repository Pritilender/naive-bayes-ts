called the group axioms namely closure associativity identity and invertibility one the most familiar examples group the set integers together with the addition operation the addition any two integers forms another the abstract formalization the group detached from the concrete nature any particular group and its allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins abstract algebra and beyond handled flexible while retaining their essential structural the ubiquity groups numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them central organizing principle contemporary groups share fundamental kinship with the notion symmetry for symmetry group encodes symmetry features geometrical object the group consists the set transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation combining two such transformations performing one after the lie groups are the symmetry groups used the standard model particle physics point groups are used help understand symmetry phenomena molecular chemistry and poincar groups can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity the concept group arose from the study polynomial equations starting with variste galois the after contributions from other fields such number theory and the group notion was generalized and firmly established around modern group theory active mathematical studies groups their own explore mathematicians have devised various notions break groups into better understandable such subgroups quotient groups and simple groups addition their abstract group theorists also study the different ways which group can expressed concretely its group representations both from theoretical and computational point view theory has been developed for finite groups which culminated with the classification finite simple groups announced since the geometric group theory which studies finitely generated groups geometric has become particularly active area group algebraic structure group

notes citations references general references special references historical references definition and illustration first the integers one the most familiar groups the set integers which consists the numbers addition the following properties integer addition serve model for the abstract group axioms given the definition for any two integers and the sum also thus adding two integers never yields some other type such fraction this property known closure under for all integers and expressed adding first and then adding the result gives the same final result adding the sum and property known associativity any then zero called the identity element addition because adding any integer returns the same for every integer there integer such that the integer called the inverse element the integer and denoted the together with the operation form mathematical object belonging broad class sharing similar structural appropriately understand these structures the following abstract definition definition the axioms for group are short and yet somehow hidden behind these axioms the monster simple group huge and extraordinary mathematical which appears rely numerous bizarre coincidences the axioms for groups give obvious hint that anything like this richard borcherds milne group set together with operation called the group law that combines any two elements and form another denoted qualify the set and must satisfy four requirements known the group axioms see below the the result operation may depend the order the other the result combining element with element need not yield the same result combining element with element the equation may not always this equation always holds the group integers under because for any two integers commutativity groups for which the commutativity equation always holds are called abelian groups honor niels abel the symmetry group described the following section example group that not the identity element group often written notation inherited from the multiplicative identity the identity element may also written especially the group operation denoted which case the group called additive the identity element can also written the set called the underlying set the group often the underlying set used short name for the group along the same shorthand expressions such subset the group element group are used when what actually meant subset the underlying set the group element the underlying set the group usually clear from the context whether symbol like refers group underlying second symmetry group two figures the plane are congruent one can changed into the other using combination rotations reflections and translations any figure congruent however some figures are congruent themselves more than one and these extra congruences are called symmetries square has eight these the identity operation leaving everything denoted rotations the square around its center right right and right denoted and respectively reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line and through the two diagonals and these symmetries are represented each these functions sends point the square the corresponding point under the for sends point its rotation right around the and sends point its reflection across the vertical middle composing two these symmetry functions gives another symmetry these symmetries determine group called the dihedral group degree and denoted the underlying set the group the above set symmetry and the group operation function composition two symmetries are combined composing them that applying the first one the and the second one the result the first the result performing first and then written symbolically from right left the left notation the same notation that used for composition the group table the right lists the results all such compositions for rotating right and then flipping horizontally the same performing reflection along the diagonal using the above highlighted blue the group group table subgroup coset given this set symmetries and the described the group axioms can understood the closure axiom demands that the composition any two symmetries and also another example for the group operation rotating right after flipping horizontally equals flipping along the diagonal indeed every other combination two symmetries still gives can checked using the group the associativity constraint deals with composing more than two starting with three elements and there are two possible ways using these three symmetries this order determine symmetry the one these ways first compose and into single then compose that symmetry with the other way first compose and then compose the resulting symmetry with the associativity means that these two ways are the product many group elements can simplified any for can checked using the group table the right while associativity true for the symmetries the square and addition not true for all for subtraction numbers not not the same the identity element the symmetry leaving everything for any symmetry performing after after equals symbolic inverse element undoes the transformation some other every symmetry can each the following identity the flips and the rotation its own because performing twice brings the square back its original the rotations and are each because rotating and then rotation vice yields rotation over which leaves the square contrast the group integers where the order the operation does matter but other not which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced history history group theory the modern concept abstract group developed out several fields the original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions polynomial equations degree higher than the century french mathematician variste galois extending prior work paolo ruffini and joseph louis lagrange gave criterion for the solvability particular polynomial equation terms the symmetry group its roots the elements such galois group correspond certain permutations the galois ideas were rejected his and published only more general permutation groups were investigated particular augustin louis cauchy arthur cayley the theory depending the symbolic equation gives the first abstract definition finite group geometry was second field which groups were used especially symmetry groups part felix klein erlangen program after novel geometries such hyperbolic and projective geometry had klein used group theory organize them more coherent further advancing these sophus lie founded the study lie groups the third field contributing group theory was number theory certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly carl friedrich gauss number theoretical work disquisitiones arithmeticae and more explicitly leopold kronecker ernst kummer made early attempts prove fermat last theorem developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers the convergence these various sources into uniform theory groups started with camille jordan trait des substitutions des quations briques walther von dyck gave the first statement the modern definition abstract the groups gained wide recognition the pioneering work ferdinand georg frobenius and william burnside who worked representation theory finite richard brauer modular representation theory and issai schur the theory lie and more generally locally compact groups was studied hermann weyl lie cartan and many its algebraic the theory algebraic groups was first shaped claude chevalley from the late and later the work armand borel and jacques tits the university chicago group theory year brought together group theorists such daniel gorenstein john thompson and walter feit laying the foundation collaboration with input from numerous other classified all finite simple groups this project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours its sheer both length proof and number research ongoing simplify the proof this these group theory still highly active mathematical impacting many other elementary consequences the group axioms basic facts about all groups that can obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under elementary group theory for repeated applications the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity generalizes more than three because this implies that parentheses can inserted anywhere within such series parentheses are usually the axioms may weakened assert only the existence left identity and left inverses both can shown actually the resulting definition equivalent the one given uniqueness identity element and inverses two important consequences the group axioms are the uniqueness the identity element and the uniqueness inverse there can only one identity element and each element group has exactly one inverse thus customary speak the identity and the inverse prove the uniqueness inverse element suppose that has two denoted and group then the two extremal terms and are since they are connected chain other words there only one inverse element similarly prove that the identity element group assume group with two identity elements and then hence and are division possible perform division given elements and the group there exactly one solution the equation right multiplication the equation gives the solution similarly there exactly one solution the equation namely and need not consequence this that multiplying group element bijection specifically element the group there bijection from itself called left translation sending similarly right translation bijection from itself sending left and right translation group element are the basic concepts mathematical symbols set elements function glossary group theory understand groups beyond the level mere symbolic manipulations more structural concepts have there conceptual principle underlying all the following take advantage the structure offered groups which being structureless not constructions related groups have compatible with the group this compatibility manifests itself the following notions various for groups can related each other via functions called group the mentioned they are required respect the group structures precise the structure groups can also understood breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient the principle preserving recurring topic mathematics instance working category this case the category groups group homomorphisms group homomorphism group homomorphisms are functions that preserve group function between two groups and called homomorphism the equation holds for all elements other the result the same when performing the group operation after before applying the map this requirement ensures that and also for all thus group homomorphism respects all the structure provided the group two groups and are called isomorphic there exist group homomorphisms and such that applying the two functions one after another each the two possible orders gives the identity functions and that and for any and from abstract point isomorphic groups carry the same for proving that for some element equivalent proving that because applying the first equality yields the and applying the second gives back the subgroups subgroup subgroup group contained within bigger concretely the identity element contained and whenever and are then are and the elements equipped with the group operation restricted indeed form the example the identity and the rotations constitute subgroup highlighted red the group table any two rotations composed are still and rotation can undone inverse the complementary rotations for for and for note that rotation the opposite direction not the subgroup test necessary and sufficient condition for subset group sufficient check that for all elements knowing the subgroups important understanding the group given any subset group the subgroup generated consists products elements and their the smallest subgroup containing the introductory example the subgroup generated and consists these two the identity element and again this because combining any two these four elements their inverses which this particular these same yields element this cosets coset many situations desirable consider two group elements the same they differ element given for above once flip the square never gets back the configuration just applying the rotation operations and further the rotation operations are irrelevant the question whether flip has been cosets are used formalize this subgroup defines left and right which can thought translations arbitrary group elements symbolic the left and right cosets containing are the cosets any subgroup form partition that the union all left cosets equal and two left cosets are either equal have empty intersection the first case happens precisely when the two elements differ element similar considerations apply the right cosets the left and right cosets may may not they for all then said normal subgroup the introductory symmetry the left cosets the subgroup consisting the rotations are either equal element itself otherwise equal highlighted the subgroup also because and similarly for any element other than quotient groups quotient group some situations the set cosets subgroup can endowed with group giving quotient group factor group for this the subgroup has normal given any normal subgroup the quotient group defined this set inherits group operation sometimes called coset coset from the original group for all and this definition motivated the idea itself instance general structural considerations outlined that the map that associates any element its coset group general abstract considerations called universal properties the coset serves the identity this and the inverse the quotient group the elements the quotient group are itself which represents the and the group operation the quotient shown the for both the subgroup well the corresponding quotient are whereas not building bigger groups smaller such from its subgroup and the quotient abstracted notion called semidirect product quotient groups and subgroups together form way describing every group its presentation any group the quotient the free group over the generators the quotiented the subgroup relations the dihedral group for can generated two elements and for the right rotation and the vertical any flip which means that every symmetry the square finite composition these two symmetries their together with the relations the group completely presentation group can also used construct the cayley graph device used graphically capture discrete groups sub and quotient groups are related the following subset can seen injective map any element the target has most one element that maps the counterpart injective maps are surjective maps every element the target mapped such the canonical map interpreting subgroup and quotients light these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent these definitions alluded the homomorphisms are neither injective nor kernel and image group homomorphisms and the first isomorphism theorem address this examples and applications examples groups applications group theory wallpaper group examples and applications groups starting point the group integers with addition group introduced instead addition multiplication one obtains multiplicative groups these groups are predecessors important constructions abstract algebra groups are also applied many other mathematical mathematical objects are often examined associating groups them and studying the properties the corresponding for henri founded what now called algebraic topology introducing the fundamental group means this topological properties such proximity and continuity translate into properties for elements the fundamental group are represented the second image the right shows some loops plane minus the blue loop considered null homotopic and thus because can continuously shrunk the presence the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk the fundamental group the plane with point deleted turns out infinite generated the orange loop any other loop winding once around the this the fundamental group detects the more recent the influence has also been reversed motivate geometric constructions theoretical similar geometric group theory employs geometric for example the study hyperbolic groups further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory addition the above theoretical many practical applications groups cryptography relies the combination the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained computational group theory particular when implemented for finite applications group theory are not restricted sciences such physics chemistry and computer science benefit from the numbers many number such the integers and the rationals enjoy naturally given group some such with the both addition and multiplication operations give rise group such number systems are predecessors more general algebraic structures known rings and fields further abstract algebraic concepts such modules vector spaces and algebras also form integers the group integers under denoted has been described the with the operation multiplication instead not form the associativity and identity axioms are but inverses not for but the only solution the equation this case which rational but not hence not every element has inverse rationals the desire for the existence multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions fractions integers with nonzero are known rational numbers the set all such fractions commonly denoted there still minor obstacle for the rationals with being because the rational number does not have multiplicative inverse there such that still not however the set all nonzero rational numbers does form abelian group under denoted associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties the closure requirement still holds true after removing because the product two nonzero rationals never finally the inverse therefore the axiom the inverse element the rational numbers including also form group under intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings division such which occupy central position abstract algebra group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts the theory those modular arithmetic addition modulo modular arithmetic two integers are added and then the sum divided positive integer called the modulus the result modular addition the remainder that for any the set integers from forms group under modular the inverse any element and the identity this familiar from the addition hours the face clock the hour hand and advanced hours ends shown the this expressed saying that equals modulo the group integers modulo written for any prime number there also the multiplicative group integers modulo its elements are the integers the group operation multiplication modulo that the usual product divided and the remainder this division the result modular for there are four group elements this because the usual product equivalent which divided yields remainder for divides denoted the primality ensures that the product two integers neither which divisible not divisible either hence the indicated set classes closed under the identity element usual for multiplicative and the associativity follows from the corresponding property finally the inverse element axiom requires that given integer not divisible there exists integer such that the inverse can found using identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor gcd equals the case above the inverse and the inverse mod hence all group axioms are actually this example similar above consists exactly those elements that have multiplicative these groups are denoted they are crucial public key cryptography cyclic groups cyclic group cyclic group group all whose elements are powers particular element multiplicative the elements the group where means and stands for etc such element called generator primitive element the additive the requirement for element primitive that each element the group can written the groups introduced the element these groups are indeed each element expressible sum all whose terms are any cyclic group with elements isomorphic this second example for cyclic groups the group complex roots unity given complex numbers satisfying these numbers can visualized the vertices regular shown blue the right for the group operation multiplication complex the multiplying with corresponds counter clockwise rotation using some field theory the group can shown for generator since and some cyclic groups have infinite number these for every zero element all the powers are despite the name cyclic the powers the elements not infinite cyclic group isomorphic the group integers under addition introduced these two prototypes are both any cyclic the study finitely generated abelian groups quite including the fundamental theorem finitely generated abelian groups and reflecting this state many related such center and commutator describe the extent which given group not symmetry groups symmetry

too group the group pattern connected the structure the object being acted chemical such crystallography space groups and point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal these symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior these and group theory enables simplification quantum mechanical analysis these for group theory used show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because the symmetry the states not only are groups useful assess the implications symmetries but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change the jahn teller effect distortion molecule high symmetry when adopts particular ground state lower symmetry from set possible ground states that are related each other the symmetry operations the likewise group theory helps predict the changes physical properties that occur when material undergoes phase transition for from cubic tetrahedral crystalline example ferroelectric materials where the change

polynomials particular their solvability give criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible solutions expressible using solely multiplication and roots similar the formula the problem can dealt with shifting field theory and considering the splitting field modern galois theory generalizes the above type galois groups field extensions and via the fundamental theorem galois theory precise relationship between fields and underlining once again the ubiquity groups finite groups finite group group called finite has finite number elements the number elements called the order

line topological group some topological spaces may endowed with group order for the group law and the topology interweave the group operations must continuous functions that and must not vary wildly and vary only such groups are called topological and they are the group objects the category topological spaces the most basic examples are the reals under and similarly with any other topological field such the complex numbers adic numbers all these groups are locally compact they have haar measures and can studied via harmonic analysis the former offer abstract formalism invariant integrals
