with logical equivalence which description relation between two the biconditional iff uses the sentences and describing relation between the states affairs which and describe contrast logically equivalent mentions both describes logical relation between those two and not factual relation between whatever matters they see use mention distinction for more the difference between using sentence and mentioning the distinction very confusing and has led many philosopher astray certainly the case that when logically equivalent iff but the converse does not reconsidering the there clearly logical equivalence between the two halves this particular for more the see quine mathematical logic section one way looking and only that means implies and only when not implies not not implies not means implies then there two way definitions philosophy and iff used indicate definitions since definitions are supposed universally quantified biconditionals mathematics and however the word normally used rather than iff this due the observation that the english language has definitional separate from its meaning propositional this separate meaning can explained noting that definition for group abelian satisfies the commutative grape raisin well not equivalence but rule for interpreting the term examples here are some examples true statements that use iff true biconditionals the first example would normally have been written with person bachelor iff that person marriageable man who has never snow english true iff schnee ist german for any and iff since this written using variables and the statement would usually written using one the other symbols used write place iff for any real numbers and iff subset containing elements dimensional vector space linearly independent iff spans the vector the triangular number even perfect number iff mersenne prime with being prime number feb only such even perfect numbers and mersenne primes have been solution the differential equation and
