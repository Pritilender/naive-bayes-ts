that also differentiable manifold with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure lie groups are named after sophus lie who laid the foundations the theory continuous transformation groups the term groupes lie first appeared french the thesis student arthur tresse page lie groups represent the developed theory continuous symmetry mathematical objects and structures which makes them indispensable tools for many parts contemporary well for modern theoretical physics they provide natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries differential equations differential galois theory much the same way permutation groups are used galois theory for analysing the discrete symmetries algebraic equations extension galois theory the case continuous

studied using differential calculus contrast with the case more general topological groups one the key ideas the theory lie groups replace the global object the with its local linearized which lie himself called its infinitesimal and which has since become known its lie algebra lie groups play enormous role modern geometry several different felix klein argued his erlangen program that one can consider various geometries specifying appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties thus euclidean geometry corresponds the choice the group preserving transformations the euclidean space conformal geometry corresponds enlarging the group the conformal group whereas projective geometry one interested the properties invariant under the projective group this idea later led the notion structure where lie group local symmetries global level whenever lie group acts geometric such riemannian symplectic manifold this action provides measure rigidity and yields rich algebraic the presence continuous symmetries expressed via lie group action manifold places strong constraints its geometry and facilitates analysis the linear actions lie groups are especially and are studied representation theory the ellis kolchin armand borel and claude chevalley realised that many foundational results concerning lie groups can developed completely giving rise the theory algebraic groups defined over arbitrary field this insight opened new possibilities pure providing uniform construction for most finite simple groups well algebraic geometry the theory automorphic forms important branch modern number theory deals extensively with analogues lie groups over adele rings adic lie groups play important via their connections with galois representations number definitions and examples real lie group group that also dimensional real smooth manifold which the group operations multiplication and inversion are smooth maps smoothness the group multiplication means that smooth mapping the product manifold into these two requirements can combined the single requirement that the mapping smooth mapping the product manifold into first examples the real invertible matrices form group under denoted noncompact disconnected determinant the rotation matrices form subgroup denoted lie group its own specifically dimensional compact connected lie group which diffeomorphic the circle using the rotation angle this group can parametrized the orthogonal group also forms interesting example lie all the previous examples lie groups fall within the class classical groups related concepts complex lie group defined the same way using complex manifolds rather than real ones and using alternate metric completion clarification needed one can define adic lie group over the adic numbers hilbert fifth problem asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological analytic ones can yield new the answer this question turned out gleason montgomery and zippin showed that topological manifold with continuous group then there exists exactly one analytic structure which turns into lie group see also hilbert smith conjecture the underlying manifold allowed dimensional for hilbert manifold then one arrives the notion dimensional lie possible define analogues many lie groups over finite fields and these give most the examples finite simple groups the language category theory provides concise definition for lie lie group group object the category smooth this because allows generalization the notion lie group lie supergroups more examples lie groups table lie groups list simple lie groups lie groups occur abundance throughout mathematics and matrix groups algebraic groups are groups matrices for orthogonal and symplectic groups and these give most the more common examples lie examples with specific number dimensions the circle group consisting angles mod under addition alternatively the complex numbers with absolute value under this dimensional compact connected abelian lie the sphere forms lie group identification with the set quaternions unit called versors the only other spheres that admit the structure lie group are the sphere real numbers with absolute value and the circle complex numbers with absolute value for for even not lie group because does not admit nonvanishing vector field and fortiori cannot parallelizable differentiable the spheres only and are the last carries the structure lie quasigroup nonassociative which can identified with the set unit octonions the metaplectic group double cover playing important role the theory modular forms connected lie group that cannot faithfully represented matrices finite nonlinear group the heisenberg group connected nilpotent lie group dimension

with ordinary vector addition the group operation becomes dimensional noncompact abelian lie the euclidean group the lie group all euclidean isometric affine dimensional euclidean space the orthogonal group consisting all orthogonal matrices with real entries dimensional lie this group but has connected subgroup the same dimension consisting orthogonal matrices determinant called the special orthogonal group for the rotation group the unitary group consisting unitary matrices with complex compact connected lie group dimension unitary matrices determinant form closed connected subgroup dimension denoted the special unitary group spin groups are double covers the special orthogonal groups used for studying fermions quantum field theory among other the group invertible matrices under matrix multiplication lie group dimension called the general linear group has closed connected subgroup the special linear group consisting matrices determinant which also lie the symplectic group consists all matrices preserving symplectic form connected lie group dimension the group invertible upper triangular matrices solvable lie group dimension borel subgroup the series and whose elements are denoted and are infinite families simple lie constructions there are several standard ways form new lie groups from old the product two lie groups lie any topologically closed subgroup lie group lie this known the closed subgroup theorem cartan theorem the quotient lie group closed normal subgroup lie the universal cover connected lie group lie for the group the universal cover the circle group fact any covering differentiable manifold also differentiable but specifying universal cover one guarantees group structure compatible with its other related notions some examples groups that are not lie groups except the trivial sense that any group can viewed dimensional lie with the discrete topology are infinite dimensional such the additive group dimensional real vector these are not lie groups they are not finite dimensional manifolds some totally disconnected groups such the galois group infinite extension the additive group the adic numbers these are not lie groups because their underlying spaces are not real some these groups are adic lie only topological groups having similar local properties for some positive integer can lie groups course they must also have differentiable early history according the most authoritative source the early history lie groups sophus lie himself considered the winter the birth date his theory continuous hawkins however suggests that was prodigious research activity during the year period from the fall the fall that led the creation ibid some early ideas were developed close collaboration with felix klein lie met with klein every day from october through berlin from the end october the end february and ttingen and erlangen the subsequent two years ibid lie stated that all the principal results were obtained but during the all his papers except the very first were published norwegian which impeded recognition the work throughout the rest europe ibid young german friedrich engel came work with lie systematic treatise expose his theory continuous from this effort resulted the volume theorie der transformationsgruppen published and lie ideas did not stand isolation from the rest his interest the geometry differential equations was first motivated the work carl gustav jacobi the theory partial differential equations first order and the equations classical mechanics much work was published posthumously the generating enormous interest france and germany lie fixe was develop theory symmetries differential equations that would accomplish for them what variste galois had done for algebraic namely classify them terms group lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for special functions and orthogonal polynomials tend arise from group theoretical additional impetus consider continuous groups came from ideas bernhard riemann the foundations and their further development the hands thus three major themes century mathematics were combined lie creating his new the idea exemplified galois through the algebraic notion group geometric theory and the explicit solutions differential equations worked out poisson and and the new understanding geometry that emerged the works cker bius grassmann and and culminated revolutionary vision the although today sophus lie rightfully recognized the creator the theory continuous major stride the development their structure which was have profound influence subsequent development was made wilhelm killing who published the first paper series entitled die zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen transformationsgruppen the composition continuous finite transformation groups the work later refined and generalized lie cartan led classification semisimple lie algebras cartan theory symmetric spaces and hermann weyl description representations compact and semisimple lie groups using highest weights weyl brought the early period the development the theory lie groups for not only did classify irreducible representations semisimple lie groups and connect the theory groups with quantum but also put theory itself firmer footing clearly enunciating the distinction between infinitesimal groups lie and the lie groups and began investigations topology lie groups borel citation needed the theory lie groups was systematically reworked modern mathematical language monograph claude chevalley the concept lie and possibilities classification lie groups may thought smoothly varying families examples symmetries include rotation about what must understood the nature transformations rotations through tiny that link nearby the mathematical object capturing this structure called lie algebra lie himself called them infinitesimal can defined because lie groups are have tangent spaces each the lie algebra any compact lie group very one for which the symmetries form bounded can decomposed direct sum abelian lie algebra and some number simple ones the structure abelian lie algebra mathematically uninteresting since the lie bracket identically the interest the simple hence the question what are the simple lie algebras compact turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite the classical lie and which have simple descriptions terms symmetries euclidean but there are also just five exceptional lie that not fall into any these the largest properties the diffeomorphism group lie group acts transitively the lie group every lie group parallelizable and hence orientable manifold there bundle isomorphism between its tangent bundle and the product itself with the tangent space the types lie groups and structure theory lie groups are classified according their algebraic properties simple semisimple solvable nilpotent abelian their connectedness connected simply connected and their compactness compact lie groups are all they are finite central quotients product copies the circle group and simple compact lie groups which correspond connected dynkin diagrams any simply connected solvable lie group isomorphic closed subgroup the group invertible upper triangular matrices some and any dimensional irreducible representation such group solvable groups are too messy classify except few small any simply connected nilpotent lie group isomorphic closed subgroup the group invertible upper triangular matrices with the diagonal some and any dimensional irreducible representation such group like solvable nilpotent groups are too messy classify except few small simple lie groups are sometimes defined those that are simple abstract and sometimes defined connected lie groups with simple lie for simple according the second definition but not according the they have all been classified for either semisimple lie groups are lie groups whose lie algebra product simple lie they are central extensions products simple lie the identity component any lie group open normal subgroup and the quotient group discrete group the universal cover any connected lie group simply connected lie and conversely any connected lie group quotient simply connected lie group discrete normal subgroup the any lie group can decomposed into simple and abelian groups canonical way write that have sequence normal subgroups then central extension simple connected lie groups circle group this can used reduce some problems about lie groups such finding their unitary the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups smaller the lie algebra associated with lie group lie lie algebra correspondence every lie group can associate lie algebra whose underlying vector space the tangent space the lie group the identity element and which completely captures the local structure the informally can think elements the lie algebra elements the group that are infinitesimally close the and the lie bracket something with the commutator two such infinitesimal before giving the abstract definition give few the lie algebra the vector space just with the lie bracket given general the lie bracket connected lie group always and only the lie group the lie algebra the general linear group invertible matrices the vector space square matrices with the lie bracket given closed subgroup then the lie algebra can thought informally the matrices such that where infinitesimal positive number with such real number exists for the orthogonal group consists matrices with the lie algebra consists the matrices with which equivalent because formally when working over the this accomplished considering the limit but the infinitesimal language generalizes directly lie groups over general rings clarification needed the concrete definition given above easy work but has some minor use first need represent lie group group but not all lie groups can represented this and not obvious that the lie algebra independent the representation get round these problems give the general definition the lie algebra lie group steps vector fields any smooth manifold can thought derivations the ring smooth functions the and therefore form lie algebra under the lie bracket because the lie bracket any two derivations any group acting smoothly the manifold then acts the vector and the vector space vector fields fixed the group closed under the lie bracket and therefore also forms lie apply this construction the case when the manifold the underlying space lie with acting left translations this shows that the space left invariant vector fields vector fields satisfying for every where denotes the differential lie group lie algebra under the lie bracket vector any tangent vector the identity lie group can extended left invariant vector field left translating the tangent vector other points the specifically the left invariant extension element the tangent space the identity the vector field defined this identifies the tangent space the identity with the space left invariant vector and therefore makes the tangent space the identity into lie called the lie algebra usually denoted fraktur thus the lie bracket given explicitly this lie algebra dimensional and has the same dimension the manifold the lie algebra determines local where two lie groups are called locally isomorphic they look the same near the identity problems about lie groups are often solved first solving the corresponding problem for the lie and the result for groups then usually follows for simple lie groups are usually classified first classifying the corresponding lie could also define lie algebra structure using right invariant vector fields instead left invariant vector this leads the same lie because the inverse map can used identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector and acts the tangent space the lie algebra structure can also described the commutator operation xyx sends its derivative yields bilinear operation this bilinear operation actually the zero but the second under the proper identification tangent yields operation that satisfies the axioms lie bracket and equal twice the one defined through invariant vector homomorphisms and isomorphisms and are lie then group homomorphism smooth group homomorphism equivalent require only that continuous rather than the composition two such homomorphisms again and the class all lie together with these forms category two lie groups are called isomorphic there exists bijective homomorphism between them whose inverse also isomorphic lie groups are essentially the they only differ the notation for their every homomorphism lie groups induces homomorphism between the corresponding lie algebras and the association functor mapping between categories satisfying certain one version ado theorem that every dimensional lie algebra isomorphic matrix lie for every dimensional matrix lie there linear group matrix lie with this algebra its lie every abstract lie algebra the lie algebra some lie the global structure lie group not determined its lie for any discrete subgroup the center then and have the same lie algebra see the table lie groups for connected lie group simple semisimple solvable nilpotent abelian and only its lie algebra has the corresponding require that the lie group simply connected then the global structure determined its lie for every dimensional lie algebra over there simply connected lie group with lie unique moreover every homomorphism between lie algebras lifts unique homomorphism between the corresponding simply connected lie the exponential map exponential map the exponential map from the lie algebra the general linear group defined the usual power for matrices any subgroup then the exponential map takes the lie algebra into have exponential map for all matrix the definition above easy but not defined for lie groups that are not matrix and not clear that the exponential map lie group does not depend its representation matrix can solve both problems using more abstract definition the exponential map that works for all lie every vector determines linear map from taking which can thought lie algebra because the lie algebra the simply connected lie group this induces lie group homomorphism that for all and the operation the right hand side the group multiplication the formal similarity this formula with the one valid for the exponential function justifies the definition this called the exponential map and maps the lie algebra into the lie group provides diffeomorphism between neighborhood and neighborhood this exponential map generalization the exponential function for real numbers because the lie algebra the lie group positive real numbers with for complex numbers because the lie algebra the lie group zero complex numbers with and for matrices because with the regular commutator the lie algebra the lie group all invertible because the exponential map surjective some neighbourhood common call elements the lie algebra infinitesimal generators the group the subgroup generated the identity component the exponential map and the lie algebra determine the local group structure every connected lie because the baker hausdorff formula there exists neighborhood the zero element such that for have where the omitted terms are known and involve lie brackets four more case and commute this formula reduces the familiar exponential law exp exp exp the exponential map from the lie algebra the lie group not always onto even the group connected though does map onto the lie group for connected groups that are either compact for the exponential map not also exponential map not surjective nor injective for dimensional see lie groups modelled chet space even from arbitrary small neighborhood corresponding neighborhood infinite dimensional lie groups lie groups are often defined but there are many groups that resemble lie except for being the simplest way define dimensional lie groups model them banach spaces and this case much the basic theory similar that dimensional lie however this inadequate for many because many natural examples dimensional lie groups are not banach instead one needs define lie groups modeled more general locally convex topological vector this case the relation between the lie algebra and the lie group becomes rather and several results about dimensional lie groups longer some the examples that have been studied the group diffeomorphisms quite lot known about the group diffeomorphisms the its lie algebra more the witt algebra which has central extension called the virasoro algebra used string theory and conformal field theory very little known about the diffeomorphism groups manifolds larger the diffeomorphism group spacetime sometimes appears attempts quantize gravity the group smooth maps from manifold dimensional lie group example gauge group with operation pointwise multiplication and used quantum field theory and donaldson theory the manifold circle these are called loop groups and have central extensions whose lie algebras are more kac moody algebras there are dimensional analogues general linear orthogonal and one important aspect that these may have simpler topological see for example kuiper theorem
