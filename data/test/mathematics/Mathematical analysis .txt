exhaustion area regular polygons limit mathematical analysis formally developed the century during the scientific revolution but many its ideas can traced back earlier early results analysis were implicitly present the early days ancient greek for infinite geometric sum implicit zeno paradox the dichotomy later greek mathematicians such eudoxus and archimedes made more but use the concepts limits and convergence when they used the method exhaustion compute the area and volume regions and the explicit use infinitesimals appears the method mechanical theorems work rediscovered the the chinese mathematician liu hui used the method exhaustion the century find the area chongzhi established method that would later called cavalieri principle find the volume sphere the the indian mathematician skara gave examples the derivative and used what now known rolle theorem the the madhava sangamagrama developed infinite series expansions like the power series and the taylor series functions such sine cosine tangent and arctangent alongside his development the taylor series the trigonometric functions also estimated the magnitude the error terms created truncating these series and gave rational approximation infinite his followers the kerala school astronomy and mathematics further expanded his the the modern foundations mathematical analysis were established century newton and leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus which with the stimulus applied work that continued through the into analysis topics such the calculus variations ordinary and partial differential equations fourier analysis and generating functions during this calculus techniques were applied approximate discrete problems continuous the euler introduced the notion mathematical function real analysis began emerge independent subject when bernard bolzano introduced the modern definition continuity but work did not become widely known until the cauchy began put calculus firm logical foundation rejecting the principle the generality algebra widely used earlier particularly instead cauchy formulated calculus terms geometric ideas and infinitesimals thus his definition continuity required infinitesimal change correspond infinitesimal change also introduced the concept the cauchy sequence and started the formal theory complex analysis poisson liouville fourier and others studied partial differential equations and harmonic analysis the contributions these mathematicians and such weierstrass developed the definition limit approach thus founding the modern field mathematical the middle the century riemann introduced his theory integration the last third the century saw the arithmetization analysis weierstrass who thought that geometric reasoning was inherently and introduced the definition limit then mathematicians started worrying that they were assuming the existence continuum real numbers without dedekind then constructed the real numbers dedekind cuts which irrational numbers are formally which serve fill the gaps between rational thereby creating complete set the continuum real which had already been developed simon stevin terms decimal expansions around that the attempts refine the theorems riemann integration led the study the size the set discontinuities real also monsters nowhere continuous functions continuous but nowhere differentiable functions space filling curves began this jordan developed his theory measure cantor developed what now called naive set theory and baire proved the baire category theorem the early calculus was formalized using axiomatic set theory lebesgue solved the problem and hilbert introduced hilbert spaces solve integral equations the idea normed vector space was the and the banach created functional analysis important concepts metric spaces metric space mathematics metric space set where notion distance called metric between elements the set much analysis happens some metric the most commonly used are the real line the complex plane euclidean space other vector spaces and the integers examples analysis without metric include measure theory which describes size rather than and functional analysis which studies topological vector spaces that need not have any sense formally metric space ordered pair where set and metric function such that for any the following non negative iff identity indiscernibles symmetry and triangle inequality sequences and limits sequence sequence ordered like set contains members also called elements terms unlike order and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times different positions the most sequence can defined function whose domain countable totally ordered set such the natural numbers one the most important properties sequence convergence informally sequence converges has limit continuing singly infinite sequence has limit approaches some point called the becomes very that for abstract sequence with running from infinity the distance between and approaches denoted main branches real analysis real analysis real analysis the theory functions real variable branch mathematical analysis dealing with the real numbers and valued functions real deals with the analytic properties real functions and sequences including convergence and limits sequences real the calculus the real and continuity smoothness and related properties valued complex analysis complex analysis complex analysis traditionally known the theory functions complex variable the branch mathematical analysis that investigates functions complex numbers useful many branches including algebraic geometry number theory applied mathematics well physics including hydrodynamics thermodynamics mechanical engineering electrical engineering and quantum field theory complex analysis particularly concerned with the analytic functions complex variables more meromorphic functions because the separate real and imaginary parts any analytic function must satisfy laplace equation complex analysis widely applicable dimensional problems physics functional analysis functional analysis functional analysis branch mathematical the core which formed the study vector spaces endowed with some kind related structure inner product norm topology etc and the linear operators acting upon these spaces and respecting these structures suitable the historical roots functional analysis lie the study spaces functions and the formulation properties transformations functions such the fourier transform transformations defining continuous unitary etc operators between function this point view turned out particularly useful for the study differential and integral equations differential equations differential equations differential equation mathematical equation for unknown function one several variables that relates the values the function itself and its derivatives various orders differential equations play prominent role engineering physics economics biology and other differential equations arise many areas science and specifically whenever deterministic relation involving some continuously varying quantities modeled and their rates change space time expressed known this illustrated classical mechanics where the motion body described its position and velocity the time value newton laws allow one given the velocity acceleration and various forces acting the express these variables dynamically differential equation for the unknown position the body function some this differential equation called equation motion may solved measure theory measure measure set systematic way assign number each suitable subset that intuitively interpreted its this measure generalization the concepts area and particularly important example the lebesgue measure euclidean space which assigns the conventional length area and volume euclidean geometry suitable subsets the dimensional euclidean space for the lebesgue measure the interval the real numbers its length the everyday sense the technically measure function that assigns negative real number subsets set see definition below must assign the empty set and countably additive the measure subset that can decomposed into finite number disjoint the sum the measures the smaller subsets one wants associate consistent size each subset given set while satisfying the other axioms one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure this problem was resolved defining measure only collection all the called measurable subsets which are required form algebra this means that countable unions countable intersections and complements measurable subsets are non measurable sets euclidean which the lebesgue measure cannot defined are necessarily complicated the sense being badly mixed with their indeed their existence trivial consequence the axiom choice numerical analysis numerical analysis numerical analysis the study algorithms that use numerical approximation opposed general symbolic manipulations for the problems mathematical analysis distinguished from discrete mathematics modern numerical analysis does not seek exact because exact answers are often impossible obtain instead much numerical analysis concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds numerical analysis naturally finds applications all fields engineering and the physical but the the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements scientific ordinary differential equations appear celestial mechanics stars and numerical linear algebra important for data stochastic differential equations and markov chains are essential simulating living cells for medicine and other topics mathematical analysis calculus variations deals with extremizing functionals opposed ordinary calculus which deals with functions harmonic analysis deals with fourier series and their geometric analysis involves the use geometrical methods the study partial differential equations and the application the theory partial differential equations clifford analysis the study clifford valued functions that are annihilated dirac like termed general monogenic clifford analytic adic analysis the study analysis within the context adic numbers which differs some interesting and surprising ways from its real and complex non standard analysis which investigates the hyperreal numbers and their functions and gives rigorous treatment infinitesimals and infinitely large computable analysis the study which parts analysis can carried out computable manner stochastic calculus analytical notions developed for stochastic processes set valued analysis applies ideas from analysis and topology valued convex analysis the study convex sets and tropical analysis idempotent analysis analysis the context the semiring the max plus algebra where the lack additive inverse compensated somewhat the idempotent rule when transferred the tropical many nonlinear problems become applications techniques from analysis are also found other areas such physical sciences the vast majority classical mechanics relativity and quantum mechanics based applied and differential equations examples important differential equations include newton second law the schr dinger equation and the einstein field equations functional analysis also major
