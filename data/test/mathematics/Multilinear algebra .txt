extends the methods linear algebra just linear algebra built the concept vector and develops the theory vector spaces multilinear algebra builds the concepts vectors and multivectors with grassmann algebra contents origin use algebraic topology conclusion the abstract approach topics multilinear algebra from the point view applications references origin vector space dimension one usually considers only the according hermann grassmann and this presumption misses the complexity considering the structures triples and general since there are several combinatorial the space multivectors turns out have dimensions the abstract formulation the determinant the most immediate multilinear algebra also has applications mechanical study material response stress and strain with various moduli this practical reference led the use the word tensor describe the elements the multilinear the extra structure multilinear space has led play important role various studies higher though grassmann started the subject with his ausdehnungslehre and published his work was slow find acceptance ordinary linear algebra provided sufficient challenges the topic multilinear algebra applied some studies multivariate calculus and manifolds where the jacobian matrix comes into the infinitesimal differentials single variable calculus become differential forms multivariate and their manipulation done with exterior algebra after developments multilinear algebra were made victor schlegel when published the first part his system der raumlehre and elwin bruno christoffel major advance multilinear algebra came the work gregorio curbastro and tullio civita see was the absolute differential calculus form multilinear algebra that marcel grossmann and michele besso introduced albert einstein the publication einstein general relativity explanation for the precession the perihelion mercury established multilinear algebra and tensors physically important use algebraic topology around the middle the century the study tensors was reformulated more the bourbaki group treatise multilinear algebra was especially influential fact the term multilinear algebra was probably coined citation needed one reason the time was new area homological algebra the development algebraic topology during the gave additional incentive for the development purely algebraic treatment the tensor product the computation the homology groups the product two spaces involves the tensor but only the simplest such torus directly calculated that fashion see nneth theorem the topological phenomena were subtle enough need better foundational technically the tor functors had the material organise was quite including also ideas going back hermann grassmann the ideas from the theory differential forms that had led rham cohomology well more elementary ideas such the wedge product that generalises the cross product the resulting rather severe the topic bourbaki entirely rejected one approach vector calculus the quaternion route that the general the relation with lie groups they instead applied novel approach using category theory with the lie group approach viewed separate since this leads much cleaner there was probably going back purely mathematical the universal property approach was this somewhat more general than category and the relationship between the two alternate ways was also being the same indeed what was done almost precisely explain that tensor spaces are the constructions required reduce multilinear problems linear this purely algebraic attack conveys geometric its benefit that expressing problems terms multilinear there clear and defined best the constraints the solution exerts are exactly those you need general there need invoke any hoc construction geometric recourse ordinate the theoretic everything entirely natural conclusion the abstract approach principle the abstract approach can recover everything done via the traditional practice this may not seem the other hand the notion natural consistent with the general covariance principle general relativity the latter deals with tensor fields tensors varying from point point manifold but covariance asserts that the language tensors essential the proper formulation general some decades later the rather abstract view coming from category theory was tied with the approach that had been developed the hermann weyl his book the classical groups way this took the theory full connecting once more the content old and new topics multilinear algebra the subject matter multilinear algebra has evolved less than
