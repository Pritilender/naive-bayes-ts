geometry lies the intersection metric geometry and affine geometry non euclidean geometry arises when either the metric requirement the parallel postulate set the latter case one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry the traditional euclidean when the metric requirement then there are affine planes associated with the planar algebras which give rise kinematic geometries that have also been called euclidean the essential difference between the metric geometries the nature parallel lines euclid fifth the parallel postulate equivalent playfair postulate which states within dimensional for any given line and point which not there exactly one line through that does not intersect hyperbolic there are infinitely many lines through not intersecting while elliptic any line through intersects see the entries hyperbolic geometry elliptic geometry and absolute geometry for more another way describe the differences between these geometries consider two straight lines indefinitely extended dimensional plane that are both perpendicular third euclidean geometry the lines remain constant distance from each other even extended and are known hyperbolic geometry they curve from each increasing distance one moves further from the points intersection with the common these lines are often called elliptic geometry the lines curve each other and contents history early history creation euclidean geometry terminology axiomatic basis euclidean geometry models euclidean geometry elliptic geometry hyperbolic geometry uncommon properties importance planar algebras kinematic geometries fiction see also notes references external links history early history while euclidean geometry named after the greek mathematician euclid includes some the oldest known non euclidean geometries were not widely accepted legitimate until the the debate that eventually led the discovery the euclidean geometries began almost soon work elements was the elements euclid began with limited number assumptions definitions five common and five and sought prove all the other results propositions the the most notorious the postulates often referred fifth simply the parallel postulate which original formulation straight line falls two straight lines such manner that the interior angles the same side are together less than two right then the straight produced meet that side which are the angles less than the two right other mathematicians have devised simpler forms this property see parallel postulate for equivalent regardless the form the however consistently appears more complicated than other postulates which for between any two points straight line may for least thousand geometers were troubled the disparate complexity the fifth and believed could proved theorem from the other many attempted find proof contradiction including ibn haytham omar nas and giovanni girolamo saccheri the theorems ibn khayyam and tusi quadrilaterals including the lambert quadrilateral and saccheri quadrilateral were the first few theorems the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries these theorems along with their alternative such playfair axiom played important role the later development euclidean these early attempts challenging the fifth postulate had considerable influence its development among later european including witelo levi ben gerson alfonso john wallis and all these early attempts made trying formulate euclidean geometry however provided flawed proofs the parallel containing assumptions that were essentially equivalent the parallel these early attempts however provide some early properties the hyperbolic and elliptic khayyam for tried derive from equivalent postulate formulated from the principles the aristotle two convergent straight lines intersect and impossible for two convergent straight lines diverge the direction which they khayyam then considered the three cases obtuse and acute that the summit angles saccheri quadrilateral can take and after proving number theorems about correctly refuted the obtuse and acute cases based his postulate and hence derived the classic postulate euclid which realize was equivalent his own another example sadr din sometimes known who wrote book the subject based later which presented another hypothesis equivalent the parallel essentially revised both the euclidean system axioms and postulates and the proofs many propositions from the elements his work was published rome and was studied european including saccheri who criticised this work well that giordano vitale his book euclide restituo used the saccheri quadrilateral prove that three points are equidistant the base and the summit then and are everywhere work titled euclides omni naevo vindicatus euclid freed from all flaws published saccheri quickly discarded elliptic geometry possibility some others axioms must modified for elliptic geometry and set work proving great number results hyperbolic finally reached point where believed that his results demonstrated the impossibility hyperbolic his claim seems have been based euclidean because logical contradiction was this attempt prove euclidean geometry instead unintentionally discovered new viable but did not realize johann lambert wrote but did not theorie der parallellinien which saccheri prove the fifth worked with figure that today call lambert quadrilateral quadrilateral with three right angles can considered half saccheri quickly eliminated the possibility that the fourth angle had saccheri and and then proceeded prove many theorems under the assumption acute unlike never felt that had reached contradiction with this had proved the euclidean result that the sum the angles triangle increases the area the triangle and this led him speculate the possibility model the acute case sphere imaginary did not carry this idea any this time was widely believed that the universe worked according the principles euclidean creation euclidean geometry the beginning the century would finally witness decisive steps the creation euclidean circa carl friedrich gauss and independently around the german professor law ferdinand karl schweikart had the germinal ideas euclidean geometry worked but neither published any then around the hungarian mathematician nos bolyai and the russian mathematician nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky separately published treatises hyperbolic consequently hyperbolic geometry called lobachevskian both independent each are the basic authors euclidean gauss mentioned when shown the younger that had developed such geometry several years though did not while lobachevsky created euclidean geometry negating the parallel bolyai worked out geometry where both the euclidean and the hyperbolic geometry are possible depending parameter bolyai ends his work mentioning that not possible decide through mathematical reasoning alone the geometry the physical universe euclidean this task for the physical bernhard riemann famous lecture founded the field riemannian geometry discussing particular the ideas now called manifolds riemannian metric and curvature constructed infinite family geometries which are not euclidean giving formula for family riemannian metrics the unit ball euclidean space the simplest these called elliptic geometry and considered euclidean geometry due its lack parallel formulating the geometry terms curvature tensor riemann allowed euclidean geometry applied higher terminology was gauss who coined the term euclidean was referring his own work which today call hyperbolic geometry several modern authors still consider euclidean and hyperbolic arthur cayley noted that distance between points inside conic could defined terms logarithm and the projective cross ratio function the method has become called the cayley klein metric because felix klein exploited describe the euclidean geometries articles and and later book the klein metrics provided working models hyperbolic and elliptic metric well euclidean klein responsible for the terms hyperbolic and elliptic his system called euclidean geometry parabolic term which generally fell out use his influence has led the current usage the term euclidean mean either hyperbolic elliptic geometry there are some mathematicians who would extend the list geometries that should called various axiomatic basis euclidean geometry euclidean geometry can axiomatically described several unfortunately euclid original system five postulates not one these his proofs relied several unstated assumptions which should also have been taken hilbert system consisting axioms most closely follows the approach euclid and provides the justification for all other using different sets undefined terms obtain the same geometry different all however there axiom which logically equivalent fifth the parallel hilbert uses the playfair axiom while birkhoff for uses the axiom which says that there exists pair similar but not congruent any these removal the one axiom which equivalent the parallel whatever form and leaving all the other axioms produces absolute geometry the first propositions euclid the elements not require the use the parallel postulate anything equivalent they are all true statements absolute obtain euclidean the parallel postulate its must replaced its negation negating the playfair axiom form since compound statement there exists one and only one can done two either there will exist more than one line through the point parallel the given line there will exist lines through the point parallel the given the first replacing the parallel postulate its with the statement given point and line not passing through there exist two lines through which not meet and keeping all the other yields hyperbolic geometry the second case not dealt with simply replacing the parallel postulate with the given point and line not passing through all the lines through meet does not give consistent set this follows since parallel lines exist absolute but this statement says that there are parallel this problem was known different saccheri and lambert and was the basis for their rejecting what was known the obtuse angle order obtain consistent set axioms which includes this axiom about having parallel some the other axioms must the adjustments made depend upon the axiom system being among others these tweaks will have the effect modifying second postulate from the statement that line segments can extended indefinitely the statement that lines are riemann elliptic geometry emerges the most natural geometry satisfying this models euclidean geometry models euclidean geometry two dimensional euclidean geometry modelled our notion flat plane elliptic geometry the simplest model for elliptic geometry where lines are great circles such the equator the meridians globe and points opposite each other called antipodal points are identified considered the this also one the standard models the real projective plane the difference that model elliptic geometry metric introduced permitting the measurement lengths and while model the projective plane there such the elliptic for any given line and point which not all lines through will intersect hyperbolic geometry even after the work gauss and the question does such model exist for hyperbolic geometry the model for hyperbolic geometry was answered eugenio beltrami who first showed that surface called the pseudosphere has the appropriate curvature model portion hyperbolic space and second paper the same defined the klein model which models the entirety hyperbolic and used this show that euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry were equiconsistent that hyperbolic geometry was logically consistent and only euclidean geometry the reverse implication follows from the horosphere model euclidean the hyperbolic within dimensional for any given line and point which not there are infinitely many lines through that not intersect these models the concepts euclidean geometries are being represented euclidean objects euclidean this introduces perceptual distortion wherein the straight lines the euclidean geometry are being represented euclidean curves which visually this bending not property the euclidean only artifice the way they are being uncommon properties euclidean and euclidean geometries naturally have many similar namely those which not depend upon the nature this commonality the subject absolute geometry also called neutral geometry however the properties which distinguish one geometry from the others are the ones which have historically received the most besides the behavior lines with respect common mentioned the also have the lambert quadrilateral quadrilateral which has three right the fourth angle lambert quadrilateral acute the geometry right angle the geometry euclidean obtuse the geometry consequently rectangles exist statement equivalent the parallel only euclidean saccheri quadrilateral quadrilateral which has two sides equal both perpendicular side called the base the other two angles saccheri quadrilateral are called the summit angles and they have equal the summit angles saccheri quadrilateral are acute the geometry right angles the geometry euclidean and obtuse angles the geometry the sum the measures the angles any triangle less than the geometry equal the geometry and greater than the geometry the defect triangle the numerical value sum the measures the angles the this result may also stated the defect triangles hyperbolic geometry the defect triangles euclidean geometry and the defect triangles elliptic geometry importance non euclidean geometry example paradigm shift the history science before the models euclidean plane were presented klein and euclidean geometry stood unchallenged the mathematical model space furthermore since the substance the subject synthetic geometry was chief exhibit the euclidean point view represented absolute the discovery the euclidean geometries had ripple effect which went far beyond the boundaries mathematics and the philosopher immanuel kant treatment human knowledge had special role for was his prime example synthetic priori not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic our knowledge space was truth that were born unfortunately for his concept this unalterably true geometry was theology was also affected the change from absolute truth relative truth mathematics that was result this paradigm the existence euclidean geometries impacted the intellectual victorian england many ways and particular was one the leading factors that caused examination the teaching geometry based euclid elements this curriculum issue was hotly debated the time and was even the subject euclid and his
