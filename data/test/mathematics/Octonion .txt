mathematics	octonion navigation search mathematics the octonions are normed division algebra over the real usually represented the capital letter using boldface blackboard bold there are only four such the other three being the real numbers the complex numbers and the quaternions the octonions are the largest such with eight twice the number dimensions the which they are they are noncommutative and nonassociative but satisfy weaker form namely they are alternative octonions are not well known the quaternions and complex which are much more widely studied and despite they have some interesting properties and are related number exceptional structures among them the exceptional lie groups additionally octonions have applications fields such string theory special relativity and quantum logic the octonions were discovered john graves inspired his friend william hamilton discovery graves called his discovery octaves and mentioned them letter hamilton dated december but his first publication his result graves was slightly later than article the octonions were discovered independently arthur cayley and are sometimes referred cayley numbers the cayley algebra hamilton described the early history discovery contents definition cayley dickson construction fano plane mnemonic conjugate norm and inverse properties commutator and cross product automorphisms isotopies integral octonions see also references external links definition the octonions can thought octets real every octonion real linear combination the unit octonions where the scalar real may identified with the real number that every octonion can written the form with real coefficients addition and subtraction octonions done adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their like multiplication more multiplication distributive over the product two octonions can calculated summing the product all the again like the product each term can given multiplication the coefficients and multiplication table the unit like this most diagonal elements the table are making almost skew symmetric matrix except for the elements the main the row and the column for which the table can summarized the where completely antisymmetric tensor with value when ijk and with the scalar and the above definition though not but only one possible definitions for octonion multiplication with the others can obtained permuting and changing the signs the scalar basis the different algebras are and there rarely need consider which particular multiplication rule each these definitions invariant signs under some cycle the points and for each cycle there are four differing signs and reversal common choice use the definition invariant under the cycle with particularly easy remember the variation this sometimes used label the elements the basis the elements the projective line over the finite field order the multiplication then given and and all expressions obtained from this adding constant mod all other words using the triples these are the nonzero codewords the quadratic residue code length over the field elements there symmetry order given adding constant mod all and also symmetry order given multiplying all subscripts one the quadratic residues mod cayley dickson construction more systematic way defining the octonions via the cayley dickson construction just quaternions can defined pairs complex the octonions can defined pairs addition defined the product two pairs quaternions and defined where denotes the conjugate the quaternion this definition equivalent the one given above when the eight unit octonions are identified with the pairs fano plane mnemonic convenient mnemonic for remembering the products unit octonions given the diagram the which represents the multiplication table cayley and this diagram with seven points and seven lines the circle through and considered called the fano plane the lines are the seven points correspond the seven standard basis elements see definition below each pair distinct points lies unique line and each line runs through exactly three let ordered triple points lying given line with the order specified the direction the then multiplication given together with cyclic permutations these rules together with the multiplicative for each point the diagram completely defines the multiplicative structure the each the seven lines generates subalgebra isomorphic the quaternions conjugate norm and inverse the conjugate octonion given conjugation involution and satisfies note the change the real part given and the imaginary part the set all purely imaginary octonions span dimension subspace denoted conjugation octonions satisfies the equation the product octonion with its always nonnegative real using this the norm octonion can this norm agrees with the standard euclidean norm the existence norm implies the existence inverses for every nonzero element the inverse given satisfies properties octonionic multiplication neither commutative nor associative the octonions satisfy weaker form they are alternative this means that the subalgebra generated any two elements associative actually one can show that the subalgebra generated any two elements isomorphic all which are because their octonions have matrix unlike quaternions the octonions retain one important property shared and the norm satisfies this implies that the octonions form nonassociative normed division algebra the dimensional algebras defined the cayley dickson construction the sedenions all fail satisfy this they all have zero divisors wider number systems exist which have multiplicative modulus dimensional conic sedenions their modulus defined differently from their and they also contain zero divisors turns out that the only normed division algebras over the reals are and these four algebras also form the only finite dimensional division algebras over the reals isomorphism not being the nonzero elements not form they however form loop indeed moufang loop commutator and cross product the commutator two octonions and given this antisymmetric and considered only product the imaginary subspace defines product that the seven dimensional cross product given like the cross product three dimensions this vector orthogonal and with magnitude but like the octonion product not uniquely instead there are many different cross each one dependent the choice octonion automorphisms automorphism the octonions invertible linear transformation which satisfies the set all automorphisms forms group called the group simply connected compact real lie group dimension this group the smallest the exceptional lie groups and isomorphic the subgroup that preserves any chosen particular vector its dimensional real spinor the group spin turn subgroup the group isotopies described see also psl the automorphism group the fano isotopies isotopy algebra triple bijective linear maps such that then for this the same the isotopy group algebra the group all which contains the group automorphisms the isotopy group the octonions the group spin with and acting the three dimensional the subgroup elements where fixes the identity the subgroup spin and the subgroup where and all fix the identity the automorphism group integral octonions there are several natural ways choose integral form the the simplest just take the octonions whose coordinates are this gives nonassociative algebra over the integers called the gravesian however not maximal and there are exactly maximal orders containing these maximal orders are all equivalent under the phrase integral usually refers fixed choice one these seven these maximal orders were constructed kirmse dickson and bruck label the basis vectors the points the projective plane over the field with elements first form the kirmse these consist octonions whose coordinates are integers half and that are half odd integers one the sets the extended quadratic residue code length over the field elements given and its its images under adding constant mod and the complements these sets kirmse incorrectly claimed that these form maximal thought there were maximal orders rather than but coxeter pointed out they are not closed under this mistake occurs several published then switch infinity and any other this gives maximal there are ways giving maximal which are all equivalent under cyclic permutations the coordinates the kirmse integers and the maximal orders are all isometric the lattice rescaled factor particular there are elements minimum nonzero norm each these forming moufang loop order the integral octonions have division with property given integral octonions and can find and with where the remainder has norm less than that the integral all left ideals and right ideals are sided and the only sided ideals are the principal ideals where negative the integral octonions have version factorization into though not straightforward state because the octonions are not associative the product octonions depends the order which one does the the irreducible integral octonions are exactly those prime and every integral octonion can written product irreducible more precisely integral octonion norm can written product integral octonions norms and the automorphism group the integral octonions the group order which has simple subgroup index isomorphic the unitary group the isotopy group the integral octonions the perfect double cover the group rotations the lattice see also composition algebra octonion algebra okubo
