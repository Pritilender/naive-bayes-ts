operational research british discipline that deals with the application advanced analytical methods help make better often considered field mathematics the terms management science and decision science are sometimes used employing techniques from other mathematical such mathematical modeling statistical analysis and mathematical optimization operations research arrives optimal optimal solutions complex making because its emphasis technology interaction and because its focus practical operations research has overlap with other notably industrial engineering and operations management and draws psychology and organization science operations research often concerned with determining the maximum performance minimum risk some world originating military efforts before world war its techniques have grown concern problems variety contents overview history historical origins second world war after world war problems addressed management science related fields applications management science societies and journals see also references notes further reading external links overview operational research encompasses wide range solving techniques and methods applied the pursuit improved making and such simulation mathematical optimization queueing theory and other stochastic process models markov decision processes econometric methods data envelopment analysis neural networks expert systems decision analysis and the analytic hierarchy process nearly all these techniques involve the construction mathematical models that attempt describe the because the computational and statistical nature most these also has strong ties computer science and analytics operational researchers faced with new problem must determine which these techniques are most appropriate given the nature the the goals for and constraints time and computing the major subdisciplines modern operational identified the journal operations research are computing and information technologies financial engineering manufacturing service sciences and supply chain management marketing engineering policy modeling and public sector work revenue management simulation stochastic models transportation history formal operational research originated the efforts military planners during world war the decades after the the techniques began applied more widely problems industry and since that operational research has expanded into field widely used industries ranging from petrochemicals finance logistics and moving focus the development mathematical models that can used analyse and optimize complex and has become area active academic and industrial historical origins the world war operational research was defined scientific method providing executive departments with quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their other names for included operational analysis ministry defence from and quantitative prior the formal start the early work operational research was carried out individuals such charles babbage his research into the cost transportation and sorting mail led universal penny and studies into the dynamical behaviour railway vehicles defence the gwr broad percy bridgman brought operational research bear problems physics the and would later attempt extend these the social the modern field operational research arose during world war modern operational research originated the bawdsey research station the and was the result initiative the rowe rowe conceived the idea means analyse and improve the working the early warning radar system chain home initially analysed the operating the radar equipment and its communication expanding later include the operating this revealed unappreciated limitations the network and allowed remedial action scientists the united kingdom including patrick blackett later lord blackett cecil gordon solly zuckerman later baron zuckerman kcb frs waddington owen jones frank yates jacob bronowski and freeman dyson and the united states with george dantzig looked for ways make better decisions such areas logistics and training after the war began applied similar problems second world war during the second world war close men and women britain were engaged operational about operational research scientists worked for the british army patrick blackett worked for several different organizations during the early the war while working for the royal aircraft establishment set team known the circus which helped reduce the number anti aircraft artillery rounds needed shoot down enemy aircraft from average over the start the battle britain blackett moved from the rae the after first working with raf coastal command and then early the admiralty blackett team coastal operational research section included two future nobel prize winners and many other people who went eminent their they undertook number crucial analyses that aided the war britain introduced the convoy system reduce shipping but while the principle using warships accompany merchant ships was generally was unclear whether was better for convoys small convoys travel the speed the slowest small convoys can travel was also argued that small convoys would harder for german boats the other large convoys could deploy more warships against blackett staff showed that the losses suffered convoys depended largely the number escort vessels rather than the size the their conclusion was that few large convoys are more defensible than many small liberator while performing analysis the methods used raf coastal command hunt and destroy one the analysts asked what colour the aircraft most them were from bomber command they were painted black for time the suggestion ors test was run see that was the best colour camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations the grey north atlantic tests showed that aircraft painted white were average not spotted until they were closer than those painted this change indicated that more submarines would attacked and sunk for the same number result these findings coastal command changed their aircraft using white warwick other work the ors indicated that average the trigger depth delivered depth charges were changed from feet feet the kill ratios would the reason was that boat saw aircraft only shortly before arrived over the target then feet the charges would damage because the boat have had time descend far feet and saw the aircraft long way from the target had time alter course under water the chances being within the foot kill zone the charges was was more efficient attack those submarines close the surface when the locations were better known than attempt their destruction greater depths when their positions could only before the change settings from feet feet submerged boats were sunk and damaged after the were sunk and damaged submarines were caught the even attacked shortly after the numbers rose sunk and damaged blackett observed there can few cases where such great operational gain had been obtained such small and simple change bomber operational research section analysed report survey carried out raf bomber command citation needed for the bomber command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over germany over particular all damage inflicted german air defences was noted and the recommendation was given that armour added the most heavily damaged this recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were not and adding armour vital areas where damage acceptable negatively affects aircraft their suggestion remove some the crew that aircraft loss would result fewer personnel was also rejected raf blackett team made the logical recommendation that the armour placed the areas which were completely untouched damage the bombers which they reasoned that the survey was since only included aircraft that returned the untouched areas returning aircraft were probably vital which would result the loss the kammhuber line when germany organised its air defences into the kammhuber line was realised the british that the raf bombers were fly bomber stream they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew individual cells directed their targets ground was then matter calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters calculate how close the bombers should fly minimise raf the exchange ratio output input was characteristic feature operational comparing the number flying hours put allied aircraft the number boat sightings given was possible redistribute aircraft more productive patrol comparison exchange rates established effectiveness useful the ratio mines laid per ship sunk was common several german mines british british mines german and united states mines japanese operational research doubled the target bomb rate bombing japan from the marianas islands increasing the training ratio from percent flying revealed that packs three united states submarines were the most effective number enable all members the pack engage targets discovered their individual patrol revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed reducing skin the operational research sections the army operational research group the ministry supply were landed normandy and they followed british forces the advance across they among other the effectiveness aerial bombing and tank after world war this section requires expansion march with expanded techniques and growing awareness the field the close the operational research was longer limited only but was extended encompass equipment training logistics and operations research also grew many areas other than the military once scientists learned apply its principles the civilian with the development
