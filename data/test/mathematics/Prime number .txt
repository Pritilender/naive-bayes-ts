called prime prime number has exactly two positive divisors and the number natural numbers greater than that are not prime are called composite among the numbers the numbers and are the prime while and are not excluded prime for reasons explained prime since the only natural numbers dividing are and next too and divide without but divided gives remainder thus however since another number addition and dividing without again none the numbers divide next divisible since not the image the right illustrates that not even number greater than prime because any such number has least three distinct namely and this implies that not accordingly the term odd prime refers any prime number greater than similar all prime numbers bigger than written the usual decimal system end since even numbers are multiples and numbers ending are multiples natural then and divide without therefore the condition being prime can also restated number prime greater than one and none divides without yet another way say the same number prime cannot written product two integers and both which are larger other prime items cannot divided into smaller size groups more than one the set all primes often denoted the first prime numbers all the prime numbers less than are oeis fundamental theorem arithmetic fundamental theorem arithmetic the crucial importance prime numbers number theory and mathematics general stems from the fundamental theorem arithmetic which states that every integer larger than can written product one more primes way that unique except for the order the prime factors primes can thus considered the basic building the natural for square this the same prime factor may occur multiple number into finitely prime factors called prime factorization the fundamental theorem arithmetic can rephrased say that any factorization into primes will identical except for the order the albeit there are many prime factorization algorithms this practice for larger they all have yield the same prime number and divides product then divides divides this proposition known euclid lemma used some proofs the uniqueness prime primality one most early greeks did not even consider and they did not consider the century many mathematicians did consider the number for derrick norman lehmer list primes reprinted late started with its first henri lebesgue said the last professional mathematician call prime although large body mathematical work would still valid when calling the above fundamental theorem arithmetic would not hold for the number can factored were admitted these two presentations would considered different factorizations into prime the statement that theorem would have furthermore the prime numbers have several properties that the number lacks such the relationship the number its corresponding value euler totient function the sum divisors function history sieve eratosthenes algorithm eratosthenes ancient greek mathematician there are hints the surviving records the ancient egyptians that they had some knowledge prime the egyptian fraction expansions the rhind papyrus for have quite different forms for primes and for however the earliest surviving records the explicit study prime numbers come from the ancient greeks euclid elements circa contain important theorems about including the infinitude primes and the fundamental theorem arithmetic euclid also showed how construct perfect number from mersenne prime the sieve attributed simple method compute although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this after the little happened with the study prime numbers until the pierre fermat stated without fermat little theorem later proved leibniz and euler fermat also conjectured that all numbers the form are prime they are called fermat numbers and verified this however the very next fermat number composite one its prime factors euler discovered and fact further fermat numbers are known the french monk marin mersenne looked primes the form with they are called mersenne primes his euler work number theory included many results about showed the infinite series divergent showed that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers the form where the second factor mersenne the start the legendre and gauss independently conjectured that tends the number primes asymptotic where the natural logarithm ideas riemann his paper the function sketched program that would lead proof the prime number this outline was completed hadamard and poussin who independently proved the prime number theorem proving number prime not done for large trial many mathematicians have worked primality tests for large often restricted specific number this includes test for fermat numbers proth theorem around the lucas lehmer primality test originated and the generalized lucas primality test more recent algorithms like aprt ecpp and aks work arbitrary numbers but remain much for long prime numbers were thought have extremely limited application outside pure mathematics this changed the when the concepts public key cryptography were which prime numbers formed the basis the first algorithms such the rsa cryptosystem since all the largest known primes have been found computers the search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical the great internet mersenne prime search and other distributed computing projects find large primes have become popular the last ten fifteen clarification needed while mathematicians continue struggle with the theory number prime numbers theorem there are infinitely many prime another way saying this that the sequence prime numbers never this statement referred euclid theorem honor the ancient greek mathematician euclid since the first known proof for this statement attributed many more proofs the infinitude primes are including analytical proof euler goldbach proof based fermat numbers furstenberg proof using general topology and kummer elegant euclid proof proof book proposition considers any finite set the key idea consider the product all these numbers plus like any other natural divisible least one prime number possible that itself none the primes which divisible can members the finite set primes with which because dividing any one these leaves remainder therefore the primes which divisible are additional primes beyond the ones started thus any finite set primes can extended larger finite set often erroneously reported that euclid begins with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime leading contradiction that contains precisely the smallest primes rather than any arbitrary finite set today the product the smallest primes plus conventionally called the euclid number euler analytical proof proof uses the sum the reciprocals this sum becomes larger than any arbitrary real number provided that big this shows that there are infinitely many since otherwise this sum would grow only until the biggest prime the growth quantified mertens second theorem for the sum does not grow infinity goes this prime numbers occur more often than squares natural brun theorem states that the sum the reciprocals twin primes testing primality and integer factorization there are various methods determine whether given number the most basic trial little practical use because its one group modern primality tests applicable arbitrary while more efficient tests are available for particular most such methods only tell whether prime routines also yielding one prime factors are called factorization algorithms trial division the most basic method checking the primality given integer called trial division this routine consists dividing each integer that greater than and less than equal the square root the result any these divisions then not otherwise indeed composite with and then one the factors necessarily most for for the trial divisions are and none these numbers divides this routine can implemented more efficiently complete list primes then trial divisions need checked only for those that are for check the primality only three divisions are necessary and given that and are while simple trial division quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number possible factors grows too rapidly increases according the prime number theorem explained the number prime numbers less than approximately given the algorithm may need this number trial divisions check the primality for this number million too large for many practical sieves algorithm yielding all primes given such required the trial division called prime number sieve the oldest the sieve eratosthenes see useful for relatively small the modern sieve atkin more but faster when properly before the advent lists primes bounds like were also primality testing versus primality proving modern primality tests for general numbers can divided into two main probabilistic monte and deterministic algorithms deterministic algorithms provide way tell for sure whether given number prime for trial division deterministic algorithm performed will always identify prime number prime and composite number probabilistic algorithms are normally but not completely prove that number these tests rely testing given number partly random for given test might pass all the time applied prime but pass only with probability applied composite repeat the test times and pass every then the probability that our number composite which decreases exponentially with the number can sure like though never perfectly that the number the other the test ever then know that the number particularly simple example probabilistic test the fermat primality test which relies the fact fermat little theorem that mod for any prime have number that want test for then work out mod for random value our flaw with this test that there are some composite numbers the carmichael numbers that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not the test has way distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime though this test can useful for practical more powerful extensions the fermat primality such the baillie psw miller rabin and solovay strassen tests are guaranteed fail least some the time when applied composite deterministic algorithms not erroneously report composite numbers the fastest such method known elliptic curve primality proving analyzing its run time based heuristic arguments opposed the rigorously proven complexity the more recent aks primality test deterministic methods are typically slower than probabilistic the latter ones are typically applied first before more consuming deterministic routine the following table lists number prime the running time given terms the number tested for probabilistic the number tests moreover arbitrarily small positive and log the logarithm unspecified the big notation means for elliptic curve primality proving requires time that bounded factor not depending but times log aks primality test elliptic curve primality proving heuristically psw primality test rabin primality test strassen primality test fermat primality test purpose algorithms and the largest known prime list prime numbers addition the aforementioned tests applying any natural number number much more efficient primality tests available for special for run lucas primality test requires the knowledge the prime factors while the lucas lehmer primality test needs the prime factors for these tests can applied check whether are prime numbers this form are known factorial primes other primes where either particular shape include the sophie germain primes primes the form with prime primorial primes fermat primes and mersenne primes that prime numbers that are the form where arbitrary the lehmer test particularly fast for numbers this this why the largest known prime has almost always been mersenne prime since the dawn electronic fermat primes are the form with arbitrary natural they are named after pierre fermat who conjectured that all such numbers are this was based the evidence the first five numbers this and being however composite and are all other fermat numbers that have been verified regular gon constructible using straightedge and compass and only where product any number distinct fermat primes and any natural including the following table gives the largest known primes the mentioned some these primes have been found using distributed computing the great internet mersenne prime search project was awarded prize for first discovering prime with least million the electronic frontier foundation also offers and for primes with least million digits and billion respectively some the largest primes not known have any particular form that simple formula such that mersenne have been found taking piece random binary converting number multiplying for some positive integer and searching for possible primes within the interval mersenne prime great internet mersenne prime search proth number seventeen bust factorial prime primegrid primorial prime primegrid twin primes primegrid integer factorization integer factorization given composite integer the task providing one prime factors referred factorization elliptic curve factorization algorithm relying arithmetic elliptic curve distribution number theorist don zagier commented that primes both the distribution primes the such the question how many primes are smaller than large described the prime number but efficient formula for the prime there are arbitrarily long sequences consecutive for every positive integer the consecutive integers from are all composite divisible for between and dirichlet theorem arithmetic progressions its basic asserts that linear polynomials with coprime integers and take infinitely many prime stronger forms the theorem state that the sum the reciprocals these prime values and that different such polynomials with the same have approximately the same proportions the corresponding question for quadratic polynomials less formulas for primes formulas for primes there known efficient formula for for mills theorem and theorem wright assert that there are real constants and such that are prime for any natural number here represents the floor function largest integer not greater than the number the latter formula can shown using bertrand postulate proven first chebyshev which states that there always exists least one prime number with for any natural however computing requires the knowledge infinitely many primes begin another formula based wilson theorem and generates the number many times and all other primes exactly there constant polynomial even several that takes only prime however there set diophantine equations variables and one parameter with the following the parameter prime and only the resulting system equations has solution over the natural this can used obtain single formula with the property that all its positive values are number prime numbers below given number prime number theorem counting function the prime counting function defined the number primes not greater than for example since there are five primes less than equal there are known algorithms compute exact values faster than would possible compute each prime the prime number theorem states that approximately given the sense that the ratio and the right hand fraction approaches when grows this implies that the likelihood that number less than prime inversely proportional the number digits more accurate estimate for given the offset logarithmic integral the prime number theorem also implies estimates for the size the prime number etc bounded grows like log the prime gaps the differences two consecutive become arbitrarily this latter statement can also seen more elementary way noting that the sequence for the notation read factorial consists composite for any natural number arithmetic progressions arithmetic progression the set natural numbers that give the same remainder when divided some fixed called modulus for arithmetic progression modulo except for none these numbers since that the remaining numbers this progression are all general all prime numbers above are the form where and has prime thus the progression can have infinitely many primes only when and are coprime their greatest common divisor this necessary condition dirichlet theorem arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many the picture below illustrates this with the numbers are wrapped soon multiple primes are highlighted the rows starting with contain most one prime all other rows and there are infinitely many prime what the primes are distributed equally among those rows the long the density all primes congruent modulo the green tao theorem shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting odd prime expressible the sum two exactly congruent modulo fermat theorem sums two squares prime values quadratic polynomials euler noted that the function gives prime numbers for fact leading into deep algebraic number theory more specifically heegner numbers for bigger does take composite the hardy littlewood conjecture makes asymptotic prediction about the density primes among the values quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients and terms and the coefficients and however progress has proved hard come quadratic polynomial with known take infinitely many prime the ulam spiral depicts all natural numbers like surprisingly prime numbers cluster certain diagonals and not suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than other open questions zeta function and the riemann hypothesis riemann hypothesis pole infinity the riemann zeta function defined infinite sum where complex number with real part bigger than consequence the fundamental theorem arithmetic that this sum agrees with the infinite product the zeta function closely related prime for the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also seen using the zeta there were only finitely many primes then would have finite however the harmonic series diverges exceeds any given there must infinitely many another example the richness the zeta function and glimpse modern algebraic number theory the following identity basel problem due the reciprocal the probability that two numbers selected random are relatively prime the unproven riemann hypothesis dating from states that except for all zeroes the function have real part equal the connection prime numbers that essentially says that the primes are regularly distributed clarification needed from physical roughly states that the irregularity the distribution primes only comes from random from mathematical roughly states that the asymptotic distribution primes about log numbers less than are the prime number theorem also holds for much shorter intervals length about the square root for intervals near this hypothesis generally believed the simplest assumption that primes should have significant irregularities without good other conjectures conjectures about prime numbers addition the riemann many more conjectures revolving about primes have been often having elementary many these conjectures have withstood proof for all four landau problems from are still one them goldbach conjecture which asserts that every even integer greater than can written sum two february this conjecture has been verified for all numbers weaker statements than this have been for example vinogradov theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can written sum three chen theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can expressed the sum prime and semiprime the product two also any even integer can written the sum six the branch number theory studying such questions called additive number theory other conjectures deal with the question whether infinity prime numbers subject certain constraints conjectured that there are infinitely many fibonacci primes and infinitely many mersenne primes but not fermat primes not known whether not there are infinite number wieferich primes and prime euclid numbers third type conjectures concerns aspects the distribution conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes pairs primes with difference twin prime conjecture polignac conjecture strengthening that states that for every positive integer there are infinitely many pairs consecutive primes that differ conjectured there are infinitely many primes the these conjectures are special cases the broad schinzel hypothesis brocard conjecture says that there are always least four primes between the squares consecutive primes greater than legendre conjecture states that there prime number between and for every positive implied the stronger cram conjecture applications for long number theory and the study prime numbers was seen the canonical example pure with applications outside the interest studying the topic with the exception use prime numbered gear teeth distribute wear number theorists such british mathematician hardy prided themselves doing work that had absolutely military however this vision was shattered the when was publicly announced that prime numbers could used the basis for the creation public key cryptography algorithms prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators some rotor machines were designed with different number pins each with the number pins any one rotor either coprime the number pins any other this helped generate the full cycle possible rotor positions before repeating any the international standard book numbers work with check digit which exploits the fact that arithmetic modulo prime and finite fields modular arithmetic modular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic only using the numbers where fixed natural number called calculating differences and products done but whenever negative number number greater than occurs gets replaced the remainder after division for for the sum instead since divided has this referred saying congruent modulo and denoted since and has remainder standard properties addition and multiplication familiar from the integers remain valid modular the parlance abstract algebra the above set which also denoted therefore commutative ring for any division however not general possible this for for the equation solution which would analogue cannot one can see calculating modulo the distinctive feature prime numbers the division possible modular arithmetic and only equivalently prime and only all integers satisfying are coprime their only common divisor indeed for the equation has unique because for any prime also denoted called field more finite field since contains finitely namely elements number theorems can derived from inspecting this abstract for fermat little theorem stating for any integer not divisble may proved using these this implies conjecture says that this equation also sufficient condition for another consequence little theorem the prime number other than and always recurring decimal whose period divisor the fraction expressed likewise base rather than has similar provided that not prime factor wilson theorem says that integer prime and only the factorial divisible moreover integer composite and only divisible other mathematical occurrences primes many mathematical domains make great use prime example from the theory finite groups are the sylow theorems finite group and the highest power the prime that divides the order then has subgroup order also any group prime order cyclic lagrange theorem public key cryptography public key cryptography several key cryptography such rsa and the diffie hellman key exchange are based large prime numbers for example bit primes are frequently used for rsa and bit primes are typical for rsa relies the assumption that much easier more perform the multiplication two numbers and than calculate and assumed coprime only the product the hellman key exchange relies the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm thought hard prime numbers nature some the

generalizations the concept prime number important that has been generalized different ways various branches generally prime indicates minimality appropriate for the prime field the smallest subfield field containing both and either the finite field with elements whence the often additional meaning intended using the word namely that any object can essentially decomposed into its prime for knot theory prime knot knot that indecomposable the sense that cannot written the knot sum two nontrivial any knot can uniquely expressed connected sum prime prime models and prime manifolds are other examples this prime elements rings prime element irreducible element prime numbers give rise two more general concepts that apply elements any commutative ring algebraic structure where subtraction and multiplication are prime elements and irreducible elements element called prime element neither zero nor unit does not have multiplicative inverse and satisfies the following given and such that divides the product then divides element irreducible cannot written product two ring elements that are not the ring the set prime elements equals the set irreducible which any ring any prime element the converse does not hold but does hold for unique factorization domains the fundamental theorem arithmetic continues hold unique factorization example such domain the gaussian integers that the set complex numbers the form where denotes the imaginary unit and and are arbitrary its prime elements are known gaussian primes not every prime gaussian the bigger ring factors into the product the two gaussian primes and rational primes prime elements the form are gaussian whereas rational primes the form are prime ideals prime ideals ring theory the notion number generally replaced with that ideal prime ideals which generalize prime elements the sense that the principal ideal generated prime element prime are important tool and object study commutative algebra algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry the prime ideals the ring integers are the ideals the fundamental theorem arithmetic generalizes the lasker noether theorem which expresses every ideal noetherian commutative ring intersection primary ideals which are the appropriate generalizations prime powers prime ideals are the points geometric via the notion the spectrum ring arithmetic geometry also benefits from this and many concepts exist both geometry and number for factorization ramification prime ideals when lifted extension field basic problem algebraic number bears some resemblance with ramification
