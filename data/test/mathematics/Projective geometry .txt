sijzi veblen virasena yang hui yasuaki aida zhang heng mathematics projective geometry the study geometric properties that are invariant under projective transformations this means compared elementary projective geometry has different projective space and selective set basic geometric the basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than euclidean space given and that geometric transformations are permitted that move the extra points called points infinity traditional and vice properties meaningful projective geometry are respected this new idea which more radical its effects than expressible transformation matrix and translations the affine transformations the first issue for geometers what kind geometric language adequate the novel not possible talk about angles projective geometry euclidean geometry because angle example concept not invariant under projective seen clearly perspective drawing one source for projective geometry was indeed the theory another difference from elementary geometry the way which parallel lines can said meet point infinity once the concept translated into projective again this notion has intuitive such railway tracks meeting the horizon perspective see projective plane for the basics projective geometry two while the ideas were available projective geometry was mainly development the nineteenth huge body research made the most representative field geometry that this was the theory complex projective space since the coordinates used homogeneous coordinates were complex several major strands more abstract mathematics including invariant theory the italian school algebraic geometry and felix klein erlangen programme leading the study the classical groups built projective was also subject with large number practitioners for its own under the banner synthetic geometry another field that emerged from axiomatic studies projective geometry finite geometry the field projective geometry itself now divided into many research two examples which are projective algebraic geometry the study projective varieties and projective differential geometry the study differential invariants the projective contents overview history description duality axioms projective geometry whitehead axioms axioms using ternary relation axioms for projective planes see also notes references external links overview projective geometry elementary metrical form meaning that not based concept two dimensions begins with the study configurations points and lines that there indeed some geometric interest this sparse setting was seen projective geometry was developed desargues and others their exploration the principles perspective art higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes that always and other linear which exhibit the principle duality the simplest illustration duality the projective where the statements two distinct points determine unique the line through and two distinct lines determine unique their point show the same structure projective geometry can also seen geometry constructions with straight edge alone since projective geometry excludes compass constructions there are and concept intermediacy was realised that the theorems that hold projective geometry are simpler for example the different conic sections are all equivalent projective and some theorems about circles can seen special cases these general the early century the work poncelet lazare carnot and others established projective geometry independent field mathematics its rigorous foundations were addressed karl von staudt and perfected italians giuseppe peano mario pieri alessandro padoa and gino fano late the projective like affine and euclidean geometry can also developed from the erlangen program felix projective geometry characterized invariants under transformations the projective group after much work the very large number theorems the therefore the basics projective geometry became the incidence structure and the cross ratio are fundamental invariants under projective projective geometry can modeled the affine plane affine plus line and then treating that line ordinary algebraic model for doing projective geometry the style analytic geometry given homogeneous the other hand axiomatic studies revealed the existence non desarguesian planes examples show that the axioms incidence can modelled two dimensions structures not accessible reasoning through homogeneous coordinate foundational projective geometry and ordered geometry are elementary since they involve minimum axioms and either can used the foundation for affine and euclidean geometry projective geometry not ordered and distinct foundation for history the first geometrical properties projective nature were discovered the third century pappus alexandria filippo brunelleschi started investigating the geometry perspective see the history perspective for more thorough discussion the work the fine arts that motivated much the development projective johannes kepler and rard desargues independently developed the pivotal concept the point desargues developed alternative way constructing perspective drawings generalizing the use vanishing points include the case when these are infinitely far made euclidean geometry where parallel lines are truly into special case encompassing geometric desargues study conic sections drew the attention year old blaise pascal and helped him formulate pascal theorem the works gaspard monge the end and beginning century were important for the subsequent development projective the work desargues was ignored until michel chasles chanced upon handwritten copy meanwhile jean victor poncelet had published the foundational treatise projective geometry poncelet separated the projective properties objects individual class and establishing relationship between metric and projective the non euclidean geometries discovered shortly thereafter were eventually demonstrated have such the klein model hyperbolic space relating projective this early century projective geometry was stepping stone from analytic geometry algebraic geometry when treated terms homogeneous coordinates projective geometry looks like extension technical improvement the use coordinates reduce geometric problems algebra extension reducing the number special the detailed study quadrics and the line geometry julius cker still form rich set examples for geometers working with more general the work poncelet steiner and others was not intended extend analytic geometry techniques were supposed synthetic effect projective space now understood was introduced reformulating early work projective geometry that satisfies current standards rigor can somewhat even the case the projective plane alone the axiomatic approach can result models not describable via linear algebra this period geometry was overtaken research the general algebraic curve clebsch riemann max noether and which stretched existing and then invariant theory towards the end the century the italian school algebraic geometry enriques segre severi broke out the traditional subject matter into area demanding deeper the later part the the detailed study projective geometry became less although the literature some important work was done enumerative geometry that now seen anticipating the theory chern classes taken representing the algebraic topology grassmannians paul dirac studied projective geometry and used basis for developing his concepts quantum mechanics although his published results were always algebraic see blog article referring article and book this also talk dirac gave general audience boston about projective without specifics its application his description projective geometry less restrictive than either euclidean geometry affine geometry intrinsically metrical geometry whose facts are independent any metric under the projective the incidence structure and the relation projective harmonic conjugates are projective range the dimensional projective geometry formalizes one the central principles perspective that parallel lines meet infinity and therefore are drawn that projective geometry may thought extension euclidean geometry which the direction each line subsumed within the line extra point and which horizon directions corresponding coplanar lines regarded line thus two parallel lines meet horizon line virtue their possessing the same idealized directions are referred points while idealized horizons are referred lines all these lines lie the plane however infinity metric purely projective geometry does not single out any lines plane this those infinity are treated just like any because euclidean geometry contained within projective with projective geometry having simpler general results euclidean geometry may arrived more transparent where separate but similar theorems euclidean geometry may handled collectively within the framework projective for parallel and nonparallel lines need not treated separate cases single out some arbitrary projective plane the ideal plane and locate using homogeneous coordinates additional properties fundamental importance include desargues theorem and the theorem pappus projective spaces dimension greater there construction that allows one prove desargues theorem but for dimension must separately under desargues theorem combined with the other possible define the basic operations geometrically the resulting operations satisfy the axioms except that the commutativity multiplication requires pappus hexagon theorem the points each line are one one correspondence with given supplemented additional such that however and remain projective geometry also includes full theory conic sections subject already very well developed euclidean there are clear advantages being able think hyperbola and ellipse distinguished only the way the hyperbola lies across the line infinity and that parabola distinguished only being tangent the same the whole family circles can seen conics passing through two given points the line infinity the cost requiring complex coordinates since coordinates are not synthetic one replaces them fixing line and two points and considering the linear system all conics passing through those points the basic object this approach proved very attractive talented and the field was thoroughly worked example this approach the volume treatise baker there are many projective which may divided into discrete and discrete geometry comprises set which may may not finite while continuous geometry has infinitely many points with gaps the only projective geometry dimension single projective geometry dimension consists single line containing least points the geometric construction arithmetic operations cannot carried out either these for dimension there rich structure virtue the absence desargues theorem fano plane according greenberg and the simplest dimensional projective geometry the fano plane which has points every with points and lines all arranged with the following schedule with the affine coordinates the coordinates desarguesian plane for the points designated the points infinity this and are generally not unambiguously clarification needed standard finite projective geometry written where order the example having only points written the term projective sometimes used indicate the generalised underlying abstract and sometimes indicate particular geometry wide such the metric geometry flat space which analyse through the use homogeneous coordinates and which euclidean geometry may embedded hence its extended euclidean plane the fundamental property that singles out all projective geometries the elliptic incidence property that any two distinct lines and the projective plane intersect exactly one point the special case analytic geometry parallel lines subsumed the smoother form line infinity which lies the line infinity thus line like any other the way special the later spirit the erlangen programme one could point the way the group transformations can move any line the line infinity given line and point not the the elliptic parallel property contrasts with the euclidean and hyperbolic parallel properties elliptic euclidean hyperbolic the elliptic parallel property the key idea which leads the principle projective possibly the most important property which all projective geometries have duality duality projective joseph gergonne noted the principle duality characterizing projective plane given any theorem definition that substituting point for line lie for pass through collinear for concurrent intersection for join vice results another theorem valid the dual the similarly dimensions the duality relation holds between points and allowing any theorem transformed swapping point and plane contained and contains more for projective spaces dimension there duality between the subspaces dimension and dimension for this specializes the most commonly known form that between points and the duality principle was also discovered independently jean victor poncelet establish duality only requires establishing theorems which are the dual versions the axioms for the dimension thus for dimensional one needs show that every point lies distinct every two planes intersect unique line and dual version the the intersection plane and coplanar with the intersection plane and then are the respective intersections planes and and assuming planes and are distinct from and the principle duality allows set dual correspondence between two geometric the most famous these the polarity reciprocity two figures conic curve dimensions quadric surface dimensions commonplace example found the reciprocation symmetrical polyhedron concentric sphere obtain the dual axioms projective geometry any given geometry may deduced from appropriate set axioms projective geometries are characterised the elliptic axiom that any two planes always meet just one line the any two lines always meet just one other there are such things parallel lines planes projective many alternative sets axioms for projective geometry have been proposed see for example coxeter hilbert cohn vossen greenberg whitehead axioms these axioms are based whitehead the axioms projective there are two points and and one incidence relation between points and the three axioms every line contains least points every two and lie unique lines and then lines and where assumed that and are distinct from and the reason each line assumed contain least points eliminate some degenerate the spaces satisfying these three axioms either have most one are projective spaces some dimension over division ring are non desarguesian planes one can add further axioms restricting the dimension the coordinate for coxeter projective geometry references veblen the three axioms together with further axioms that make the dimension and the coordinate ring commutative field characteristic axioms using ternary relation one can pursue axiomatization postulating ternary denote when three points not all necessarily are axiomatization may written down terms this relation and are two points such that and then and are two points then there third point such that and are two and with but not then there point such that and for two different and the line defined consisting all points for which the axioms and then provide formalization for and for the concept line generalizes planes and dimensional may thus recursively defined terms the subspace that containing all the points all lines ranges over collinearity then generalizes the relation independence set points minimal generating subset for the subspace the projective axioms may supplemented further axioms postulating limits the dimension the the minimum dimension determined the existence independent set the required for the lowest the relevant conditions may stated equivalent form projective space least dimension has least point least dimension has least distinct points and therefore least dimension has least non collinear points two line and point not the least dimension has least non coplanar the maximum dimension may also determined similar for the lowest they take the following projective space most dimension has more than point most dimension has more than line most dimension has more than plane and general theorem consequence axiom that all coplanar lines the very principle projective geometry was originally intended therefore property may equivalently stated that all lines intersect one generally assumed that projective spaces are least dimension some the focus projective variant may the axioms eves for include and axiom becomes vacuously true under and therefore not needed this axioms for projective planes projective plane incidence geometry most authors give treatment that embraces the fano plane the minimal finite projective axiom system that achieves this any two distinct points lie unique any two distinct lines meet unique there exist least four points which three are coxeter introduction geometry gives list five axioms for more restrictive concept projective plane attributed adding pappus theorem the list axioms above which eliminates non desarguesian planes and excluding projective planes over fields characteristic those that satisfy the restricted planes given this manner more closely resemble the real projective plane see also projective line projective plane projective space
