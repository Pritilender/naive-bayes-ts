and september mathematics rational number any number that can expressed the quotient fraction two integers with the denominator not equal since may equal every integer rational the set all rational numbers usually denoted boldface blackboard bold unicode was thus denoted peano after quoziente italian for quotient the decimal expansion rational number always either terminates after finite number digits begins repeat the same finite sequence digits over and moreover any repeating terminating decimal represents rational these statements hold true not just for base but also for binary hexadecimal any other integer base real number that not rational called irrational irrational numbers include and the decimal expansion irrational number continues without since the set rational numbers countable and the set real numbers uncountable almost all real numbers are the rational numbers can formally defined the equivalence classes the quotient set where the cartesian product the set all ordered pairs where and are integers and the equivalence relation defined and only abstract algebra the rational numbers together with certain operations addition and multiplication form field this the archetypical field characteristic zero and the field fractions for the ring finite extensions are called algebraic number fields and the algebraic closure the field algebraic numbers mathematical analysis the rational numbers form dense subset the real the real numbers can constructed from the rational numbers completion using cauchy sequences dedekind cuts infinite decimals zero divided any other integer equals therefore zero rational number but division zero contents terminology arithmetic embedding integers equality ordering addition subtraction multiplication division inverse exponentiation integer power continued fraction representation formal construction properties real numbers and topological properties adic numbers see also references external links terminology the term rational reference the set refers the fact that rational number represents ratio two the adjective rational often means that the underlying field considered the field rational rational polynomial usually and most means polynomial with rational also called polynomial over the however rational function does not mean the underlying field the rational and rational algebraic curve not algebraic curve with rational arithmetic fraction arithmetic with fractions embedding integers any integer can expressed the rational number equality ordering where both denominators are either denominator the fractions must first converted into equivalent forms with positive through the and addition two fractions are added subtraction multiplication the rule for multiplication division where note that division equivalent multiplying the reciprocal the divisor inverse additive and multiplicative inverses exist the rational exponentiation integer power negative then and continued fraction representation continued fraction finite continued fraction expression such where are every rational number has two closely related expressions finite continued whose coefficients can determined applying the euclidean algorithm formal construction mathematically may construct the rational numbers equivalence classes ordered pairs integers with this space equivalence classes the quotient space where and only can define addition and multiplication these pairs with the following and division the equivalence relation and only congruence relation compatible with the addition and multiplication defined and may define the quotient set identify two pairs and they are equivalent the above this construction can carried out any integral domain see field fractions denote the equivalence class containing then belongs and belongs this case can write given any equivalence class there are countably infinite number since the canonical choice for chosen that gcd and share common and are coprime for would write instead even though can also define total order let the and symbol and the symbol say that the integers may considered rational numbers the embedding that maps properties the set together with the addition and multiplication operations shown forms field the field fractions the integers the rationals are the smallest field with characteristic zero every other field characteristic zero contains copy the rational numbers are therefore the prime field for characteristic the algebraic closure the field roots rational the algebraic numbers the set all rational numbers countable since the set all real numbers say that almost all real numbers are the sense lebesgue measure the set rational numbers null set the rationals are densely ordered set between any two there sits another and therefore infinitely many other for for any two fractions such that where are have any totally ordered set which dense the above and has least greatest element order isomorphic the rational real numbers and topological properties the rationals are dense subset the real every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close related property that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions regular continued fractions virtue their the rationals carry order topology the rational subspace the real also carry subspace topology the rational numbers form metric space using the absolute difference metric and this yields third topology all three topologies coincide and turn the rationals into topological field the rational numbers are important example space which not locally compact the rationals are characterized topologically the unique countable metrizable space without isolated points the space also totally disconnected the rational numbers not form complete metric space the real numbers are the completion under the metric above adic numbers adic number addition the absolute value metric mentioned there are other metrics which turn into topological let prime number and for any zero integer let where the highest power dividing addition set for any rational number set then defines metric the metric space not and its completion the adic number field ostrowski theorem states that any trivial absolute value the rational numbers equivalent either the usual real absolute value adic absolute see also floating point ford circles theorem
