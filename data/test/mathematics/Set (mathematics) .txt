mathematics	set navigation search naive set theory axiomatic set theory venn diagram intersection mathematics set collection distinct considered object its own for the numbers and are distinct objects when considered but when they are considered collectively they form single set size written sets are one the most fundamental concepts developed the end the set theory now ubiquitous part and can used foundation from which nearly all mathematics can mathematics education elementary topics such venn diagrams are taught young while more advanced concepts are taught part university the german word menge rendered set was coined bernard bolzano his work the paradoxes the infinite contents definition describing sets membership subsets power sets cardinality special sets basic operations unions intersections complements cartesian product applications axiomatic set theory principle inclusion and exclusion see also notes references external links definition set well defined collection distinct the objects that make set also known the elements members can numbers people letters the other and georg cantor the founder set gave the following definition set the beginning his beitr zur ndung der transfiniten mengenlehre set gathering together into whole distinct objects our perception our which are called elements the sets are conventionally denoted with capital letters sets and are equal and only they have precisely the same cantor definition turned out inadequate for formal instead the notion set taken undefined primitive axiomatic set theory and its properties are defined the zermelo fraenkel axioms the most basic properties are that set has and that two sets are equal one and the and only every element one set element the describing sets there are two ways specifying the members one way intensional definition using rule semantic integers french flag the second way extension that listing each member the extensional definition denoted enclosing the list members curly brackets there are two important points note about first set can have two more members which are for however say that two sets which differ only that one has duplicate members are fact exactly identical see axiom extensionality hence the set exactly identical the set the second important point that the order which the elements set are listed irrelevant unlike for sequence tuple can illustrate these two important points with for sets with many the enumeration members can for the set the first thousand positive integers may specified extensionally where the ellipsis indicates that the list continues the obvious ellipses may also used where sets have infinitely many thus the set positive even numbers can written the notation with braces may also used intensional specification this the braces have the meaning the set all playing card the set whose four members are and more general form this set builder notation through for the set the twenty smallest integers that are four less than perfect squares can this the colon means such and the description can interpreted the set all numbers the form such that whole number the range from inclusive sometimes the vertical bar used instead the one often has the choice specifying set intensionally the examples for and membership element member this denoted while not member then for with respect the sets white red and and defined subsets subset every member set also member set then said subset written also pronounced contained equivalently can write read superset includes contains the relationship between sets established called inclusion containment subset but not equal then called proper subset written proper subset proper superset note that the expressions and are used differently different some authors use them mean the same respectively whereas other use them mean the same respectively subset the set all men proper subset the set all the empty set subset every set and every set subset obvious but useful which can often used show that two seemingly different sets are and only and partition set set nonempty subsets such that every element exactly one these power sets power set the power set set the set all subsets note that the power set contains itself and the empty set because these are both subsets for the power set the set the power set set usually written the power set finite set with elements has elements this relationship one the reasons for the terminology power set citation needed for the set contains three and the power set shown above contains elements the power set infinite either countable uncountable set always moreover the power set set always strictly bigger than the original set the sense that there way pair every element with exactly one element there never onto map surjection from onto every partition set subset the powerset cardinality cardinality the cardinality set the number members for blue white red there unique set with members and zero which called the empty set the null set and denoted the symbol other notations are see empty set for the set all sided squares has zero members and thus the empty though may seem the empty like the number zero important indeed the existence this set one the fundamental concepts axiomatic set theory some sets have infinite cardinality the set natural numbers for some infinite cardinalities are greater than for the set real numbers has greater cardinality than the set natural however can shown that the cardinality which the number points straight line the same the cardinality any segment that the entire plane and indeed any finite dimensional euclidean space special sets there are some sets that hold great mathematical importance and are referred with such regularity that they have acquired special names and notational conventions identify one these the empty set denoted another the unit set which contains exactly one namely many these sets are represented using blackboard bold bold special sets numbers denoting the set all primes denoting the set all natural numbers sometimes defined containing denoting the set all integers whether negative denoting the set all rational numbers that the set all proper and improper fractions for and all integers are this set since every integer can expressed the fraction denoting the set all real numbers this set includes all rational together with all irrational numbers that numbers that cannot rewritten such well transcendental numbers such and numbers that cannot defined denoting the set all complex numbers for denoting the set all quaternions for positive and negative sets are denoted superscript for represents the set positive rational each the above sets numbers has infinite number and each can considered proper subset the sets listed below the primes are used less frequently than the others outside number theory and related basic operations there are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given unions union union set two sets can added together the union and denoted the set all things that are members either examples some basic properties and only intersections intersection set new set can also constructed determining which members two sets have the intersection and denoted the set all things that are members both and then and are said disjoint intersection examples some basic properties and only complements relative complement complement symmetric difference complement set two sets can also subtracted the relative complement also called the set theoretic difference and denoted the set all elements that are members but not members note that valid subtract members set that are not the such removing the element green from the set doing has certain settings all sets under discussion are considered subsets given universal set such called the absolute complement simply complement and denoted examples the set the set even and the set odd then some basic properties for and extension the complement the symmetric difference defined for sets for the symmetric difference and the set cartesian product cartesian product new set can constructed associating every element one set with every element another the cartesian product two sets and denoted the set all ordered pairs such that member and member examples white red white red white white green red white green red white green some basic properties cartesian let and finite then applications set theory seen the foundation from which virtually all mathematics can for structures abstract algebra such groups fields and rings are sets closed under one more one the main applications naive set theory constructing relations relation from domain codomain subset the cartesian product given this are quick see that the set all ordered pairs where quite has domain set and codomain set that also because the set all squares subset the set all placed functional this relation becomes the reason these two are equivalent for any given that the function defined its corresponding ordered member the set axiomatic set theory axiomatic set theory although initially naive set theory which defines set merely any well defined collection was well soon ran into several was found that this definition spawned several paradoxes most russell paradox shows that the set all sets that not contain themselves the set set and does not cantor paradox shows that the set all cannot the reason that the phrase well defined not very well was important free set theory these paradoxes because nearly all mathematics was being redefined terms set attempt avoid these set theory was axiomatized based first order logic and thus axiomatic set theory was for most purposes naive set theory still principle inclusion and exclusion inclusion exclusion principle this principle gives the cardinality the union see also logic portal set notation mathematical object alternative set theory axiomatic set theory category sets class set dense set
