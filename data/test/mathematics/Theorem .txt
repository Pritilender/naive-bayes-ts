mathematical theorem logical argument for the theorem statement given accord with the rules deductive system the proof theorem often interpreted justification the truth the theorem light the requirement that theorems the concept theorem fundamentally deductive contrast the notion scientific theory which empirical many mathematical theorems are conditional this the proof deduces the conclusion from the light the interpretation proof justification the conclusion often viewed necessary consequence the namely that the conclusion true case the hypotheses are without any further however the conditional could interpreted differently certain deductive systems depending the meanings assigned the derivation rules and the conditional although they can written completely symbolic for within the propositional calculus theorems are often expressed natural language such the same true which are often expressed logically organized and clearly worded informal intended convince readers the truth the statement the theorem beyond any and from which formal symbolic proof can principle such arguments are typically easier check than purely symbolic many mathematicians would express preference for proof that not only demonstrates the validity but also explains some way why obviously some picture alone may sufficient prove because theorems lie the core they are also central its theorems are often described being trivial difficult deep even beautiful these subjective judgments vary not only from person but also with for proof simplified better theorem that was once difficult may become the other deep theorem may simply but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas fermat last theorem particularly known example such contents informal account theorems provability and theoremhood relation with scientific theories terminology layout lore theorems logic syntax and semantics derivation theorem interpretation formal theorem theorems and theories see also notes references external links informal account theorems logically many theorems are the form indicative conditional then such theorem does not assert only that necessary consequence this case called the hypothesis the theorem note that hypothesis here something very different from conjecture and the conclusion and are termed the antecedent and consequent the theorem even natural number then natural typical example which the hypothesis even natural and the conclusion also natural theorem must expressible formal nevertheless theorems are usually expressed natural language rather than completely symbolic with the intention that the reader can produce formal statement from the informal common mathematics choose number hypotheses within given language and declare that the theory consists all statements provable from these these hypothesis form the foundational basis the theory and are called axioms the field mathematics known proof theory studies formal axioms and the structure planar four color theorem some theorems are trivial the sense that they follow from axioms and other theorems obvious ways and not contain any surprising some the other may called deep because their proofs may long and involve areas mathematics superficially distinct from the statement the theorem show surprising connections between disparate areas theorem might simple state and yet excellent example last and there are many other examples simple yet deep theorems number theory and combinatorics among other other theorems have known proof that cannot easily written the most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the kepler conjecture both these theorems are only known true reducing them computational search that then verified computer initially many mathematicians did not accept this form but has become more widely the mathematician doron zeilberger has even gone far claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever many mathematical theorems can reduced more straightforward including polynomial trigonometric identities and hypergeometric page needed provability and theoremhood establish mathematical statement proof that line reasoning from axioms the system and already established the given statement must however the proof usually considered separate from the theorem although more than one proof may known for single only one proof required establish the status statement the pythagorean theorem and the law quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title theorem with the greatest number distinct relation with scientific theories theorems mathematics and theories science are fundamentally different their epistemology scientific theory cannot its key attribute that falsifiable that makes predictions about the natural world that are testable experiments any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness the scientific least limits its accuracy domain mathematical the other are purely abstract formal the proof theorem cannot involve experiments other empirical evidence the same way such evidence used support scientific collatz conjecture fractal universality mandelbrot set there some degree empiricism and data collection involved the discovery mathematical establishing sometimes with the use powerful mathematicians may have idea what and some cases even plan for how set about doing the for the collatz conjecture has been verified for start values about the riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first trillion zeroes the zeta function neither these statements considered such evidence does not constitute for the mertens conjecture statement about natural numbers that now known but explicit counterexample natural number for which the mertens function equals exceeds the square root all numbers less than have the mertens and the smallest number that does not have this property only known less than the exponential which approximately the power since the number particles the universe generally considered less than the power googol there hope find explicit counterexample exhaustive search note that the word theory also exists denote body mathematical definitions and for group theory there are also theorems particularly and but they often have statements and proofs which physical assumptions and intuition play important the physical axioms which such theorems are based are themselves terminology number different terms for mathematical statements these terms indicate the role statements play particular the distinction between different terms sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage some terms has evolved over axiom postulate statement that accepted without proof and regarded fundamental historically these have been regarded but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject classical axioms are general statements while postulates are statements about geometrical definition also accepted without proof since simply gives the meaning word phrase terms known proposition generic term for theorem particular this term sometimes connotes statement with simple while the term theorem usually reserved for the most important results those with long difficult classical proposition may construction that satisfies given for proposition book elements the construction equilateral lemma helping proposition with little applicability except that forms part the proof larger some the relative importance different theorems becomes more what was once considered lemma now considered though the word lemma remains the examples include gauss lemma zorn lemma and the fundamental lemma corollary proposition that follows with little proof from one other theorem converse theorem statement formed interchanging what given theorem and what for the isosceles triangle theorem states that two sides triangle are equal then two angles are the the given that two sides are and what proved that two angles are are the converse the statement that two angles triangle are equal then two sides are this the converse can proven another but this often not the for the converse the theorem that two right angles are equal angles the statement that two equal angles must right and this clearly not always the there are other less commonly that are conventionally attached proven that certain theorems are referred historical customary for identity used for theorems that state equality between two mathematical examples include euler formula and vandermonde identity rule used for certain theorems such bayes rule and cramer rule that establish useful law examples include the law large numbers the law cosines and kolmogorov one law principle examples include harnack principle the least upper bound principle and the pigeonhole principle few known theorems have even more idiosyncratic the division algorithm see euclidean division theorem expressing the outcome division the natural numbers and more general the identity theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor two numbers may written linear combination these the banach tarski paradox theorem measure theory that paradoxical the sense that contradicts common intuitions about volume dimensional unproven statement that believed true called conjecture sometimes hypothesis but with different meaning from the one discussed considered statement must usually proposed which point the name the proponent may attached the with goldbach conjecture other famous conjectures include the collatz conjecture and the riemann the other fermat last theorem has always been known that even before was was never known layout theorem and its proof are typically laid out theorem statement theorem sometimes called the proof description end the end the proof may signalled the letters quod erat demonstrandum one the tombstone marks meaning end introduced paul halmos following their usage magazine the exact style depends the author many publications provide instructions macros for typesetting the house style common for theorem preceded definitions describing the exact meaning the terms used the also common for theorem preceded number propositions lemmas which are then used the however lemmas are sometimes embedded the proof either with nested with their proofs presented after the proof the corollaries theorem are either presented between the theorem and the directly after the sometimes corollaries have proofs their own that explain why they follow from the lore has been

formal the statements the language are strings symbols and may broadly divided into nonsense and formed set deduction rules also called transformation rules rules inference must these deduction rules tell exactly when formula can derived from set the set formed formulas may broadly divided into theorems and however according hofstadter formal system often simply defines all its formed formula page needed different sets derivation rules give rise different interpretations what means for expression some derivation rules and formal languages are intended capture mathematical the most common examples use first order logic other deductive systems describe term rewriting such the reduction rules for calculus the definition theorems elements formal language allows for results proof theory that study the structure formal proofs and the structure provable the most famous result incompleteness representing theorems about basic number theory expressions formal and then representing this language within number theory del constructed examples statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations number syntactic entities formal languages symbols strings symbols nonsense formed formulas theorem may expressed formal language formalized formal theorem the purely formal analogue formal theorem type well formed formula that satisfies certain logical and syntactic the notation often used indicate that formal theorems consist formulas formal language and the transformation rules formal specifically formal theorem always the last formula derivation some formal system each formula which logical consequence the formulas that came before the the initially accepted formulas the derivation are called its axioms and are the basis which the theorem set theorems called theory what makes formal theorems useful and interest that they can interpreted true propositions and their derivations may interpreted proof the truth the resulting set formal theorems may referred formal theory theorem whose interpretation true statement about formal system called metatheorem syntax and semantics syntax formal semantics the concept formal theorem fundamentally contrast the notion true which introduces semantics different deductive systems can yield other depending the presumptions the derivation rules belief justification other modalities the soundness formal system depends whether not all its theorems are also validities validity formula that true under any possible classical propositional logic validities are tautologies formal system considered semantically complete when all its tautologies are also derivation theorem formal proof the notion theorem very closely connected its formal proof also called derivation illustrate how derivations are will work very simplified formal let call ours its alphabet consists only two symbols and its formation rule for formulas the single axiom abba the only rule inference transformation for theorems are defined those formulae that have derivation ending with that for example abba given abbba applying the transformation abbbab applying the transformation therefore abbbab theorem the notion truth cannot applied the formula abbbab until interpretation given its thus this the formula does not yet represent but merely empty two metatheorems are interpretation formal theorem interpretation theorems and
