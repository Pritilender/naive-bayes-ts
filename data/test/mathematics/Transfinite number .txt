mathematics	transfinite number navigation search transfinite numbers are numbers that are infinite the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers yet not necessarily absolutely infinite the term transfinite was coined georg cantor who wished avoid some the implications the word infinite connection with these which were nevertheless not finite few contemporary writers share these now accepted usage refer transfinite cardinals and ordinals infinite however the term transfinite also remains definition with finite there are two ways thinking transfinite ordinal and cardinal unlike the finite ordinals and the transfinite ordinals and cardinals define different classes defined the lowest transfinite ordinal number and the order type the natural numbers under their usual linear aleph null defined the first transfinite cardinal number and the cardinality the infinite set the natural the axiom choice holds the next higher cardinal number aleph one there may other cardinals which are incomparable with one and larger than but any there are cardinals between zero and the continuum hypothesis states that there are intermediate cardinal numbers between null and the cardinality the continuum the set real numbers that aleph one the cardinality the set real zermelo fraenkel set theory zfc then neither the continuum hypothesis nor its negation can proven from zfc some including suppes and rubin use the term transfinite cardinal refer the cardinality dedekind infinite set contexts where this may not equivalent infinite that contexts where the axiom countable choice not assumed not known given this the following are all transfinite that there dedekind infinite set such that the cardinality there cardinal such that see also absolutely infinite aleph number beth number georg cantor cardinal number inaccessible cardinal infinity plus one infinitesimal transfinite large cardinal large countable ordinal limit ordinal mahlo cardinal measurable cardinal ordinal arithmetic ordinal number transfinite induction
