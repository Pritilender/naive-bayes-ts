mathematics concerned with differentiation and integration vector fields primarily dimensional euclidean space the term vector sometimes used synonym for the broader subject multivariable calculus which includes vector calculus well partial differentiation and multiple integration vector calculus plays important role differential geometry and the study partial differential equations used extensively physics and engineering especially the description electromagnetic fields gravitational fields and fluid flow vector calculus was developed from quaternion analysis willard gibbs and oliver heaviside near the end the and most the notation and terminology was established gibbs and edwin bidwell wilson their book vector analysis the conventional form using cross vector calculus does not generalize higher while the alternative approach geometric algebra which uses exterior products does discussed below contents basic objects vector operations algebraic operations differential operations theorems generalizations different manifolds other dimensions see also notes references external links basic objects the basic objects vector calculus are scalar fields valued and vector fields valued these are then combined transformed under various and more advanced one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields which are identical vector fields and scalar fields except that they change sign under reversing for the curl vector field pseudovector and one reflects vector the curl points the opposite this distinction clarified and elaborated geometric described vector operations algebraic operations the basic algebraic operations vector calculus are referred vector algebra being defined for vector space and then globally applied vector and consist scalar multiplication vector addition dot product cross product there are also two triple products scalar triple product vector triple product although these are less often used basic they can expressed terms the dot and cross differential operations vector calculus studies various differential operators defined scalar vector which are typically expressed terms the del operator also known nabla the five most important differential operations vector calculus gradient curl divergence vector laplacian laplacian where the curl and divergence differ because the former uses cross product and the latter dot product denotes scalar field and denotes vector quantity called the jacobian useful for studying functions when both the domain and range the function are such change variables during theorems likewise there are several important theorems related these operators which generalize the fundamental theorem calculus higher gradient theorem line integral curve theorem theorem surface divergence theorem flux generalizations different manifolds vector calculus initially defined for euclidean space which has additional structure beyond simply being dimensional real vector namely inner product the dot product which gives notion length and hence and orientation which gives notion handed and these structures give rise volume form and also the cross product which used pervasively vector the gradient and divergence require only the inner while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness the coordinate system taken into account see cross product and handedness for more vector calculus can defined other dimensional real vector spaces they have inner product more generally symmetric nondegenerate form and note that this less data than isomorphism euclidean does not require set coordinates frame which reflects the fact that vector calculus invariant under rotations the special orthogonal group more vector calculus can defined any dimensional oriented riemannian manifold more generally pseudo riemannian manifold this structure simply means that the tangent space each point has inner product more symmetric nondegenerate and more globally that there symmetric nondegenerate metric tensor and and works because vector calculus defined terms tangent vectors each other dimensions most the analytic results are easily more general using the machinery differential geometry which vector calculus forms grad and div generalize immediately other the gradient divergence and laplacian yielding harmonic analysis while curl and cross product not generalize from general point the various fields vector calculus are uniformly seen being vector scalar fields are vector vector fields are vector pseudovector fields are vector and pseudoscalar fields are vector higher dimensions there are additional types fields pseudoscalar corresponding dimensions which exhaustive dimension one cannot only work with scalars and any assuming nondegenerate grad scalar function vector and div vector field scalar but only dimension and trivially dimension the curl vector field vector and only dimensions can cross product defined generalizations other dimensionalities either require vectors yield vector are alternative lie algebras which are more general antisymmetric bilinear the generalization grad and and how curl may generalized elaborated curl generalizations the curl vector field bivector field which may interpreted the special orthogonal lie algebra infinitesimal however this cannot identified with vector field because the dimensions differ there are dimensions rotations dimensions but dimensions rotations dimensions and more generally dimensions rotations dimensions there are two important alternative generalizations vector the geometric algebra uses vector fields instead vector fields fewer every vector field can identified with scalar function vector but this not true higher this replaces the cross which specific dimensions taking two vector fields and giving output vector with the exterior product which exists all dimensions and takes two vector giving output bivector field this product yields clifford algebras the algebraic structure vector spaces with orientation and nondegenerate geometric algebra mostly used generalizations physics and other applied fields higher the second generalization uses differential forms covector instead vector fields vector and widely used particularly differential geometry geometric topology and harmonic analysis particular yielding hodge theory oriented riemannian from this point grad curl and div correspond the exterior derivative and respectively and the key theorems vector calculus are all special cases the general form stokes theorem from the point view both these vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less from the point view geometric vector calculus implicitly identifies vector fields with vector fields scalar vectors and vectors with vectors and vectors with from the point view differential vector calculus implicitly identifies forms with scalar fields vector forms and forms with scalar forms and forms with vector thus for example the curl naturally takes input vector but naturally has output vector field form hence pseudovector which then interpreted vector rather than directly taking vector field vector this reflected the curl vector field higher dimensions not having output vector see also real valued function function
