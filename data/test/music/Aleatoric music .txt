music	aleatoric music navigation search aleatoric music also aleatory music chance music from the latin word alea meaning dice music which some element the composition left chance and some primary element composed realization left the determination its the term most often associated with procedures which the chance element involves relatively limited number the term became known european composers through lectures acoustician werner eppler the darmstadt international summer courses for new music the beginning the according his process said aleatoric its course determined general but depends chance eppler through confusion german terms aleatorik and aleatorisch his translator created new english aleatoric rather than using the existing english adjective aleatory which quickly became fashionable and has persisted jacobs more the variant aleatoriality has been introduced contents history early precedents modern usage types indeterminate music open chance music film music see also sources external links history early precedents compositions that could considered precedent for aleatory composition date back least the late with the genre the exemplified the missa cuiusvis toni johannes ockeghem later genre was the musikalisches rfelspiel musical dice game popular the late and early one such dice game attributed wolfgang amadeus mozart these games consisted sequence musical measures for which each measure had several possible and procedure for selecting the precise sequence based the throwing number dice boehmer the french artist marcel duchamp composed two pieces between and based chance one erratum musical written for three was published american composer john cage music changes often considered the first piece conceived largely through random procedures randel though his indeterminacy different order from cage later asked how that you used chance operations when was just being lotringer page needed modern usage the earliest significant use aleatory features found many the compositions american charles ives the early henry cowell adopted ideas during the such works the mosaic quartet string quartet which allows the players arrange the fragments music number different possible cowell also used specially devised notations introduce variability into the performance sometimes instructing the performers improvise short passage play libitum griffiths later american such alan hovhaness beginning with his lousadzak used procedures superficially similar which different short patterns with specified pitches and rhythm are assigned several with instructions that they performed repeatedly their own speed without coordination with the rest the some scholars regard the resultant blur hardly since exact pitches are carefully controlled and any two performances will substantially the rosner and wolverton although according another this technique essentially the same that later used witold awski fisher unreliable depending the vehemence the hovhaness published scores annotate these sections for example free tempo humming hovhaness and repeat and repeat but not hovhaness following the introduction the expression aleatory the french composer pierre boulez was largely responsible for popularizing the term boulez other early european examples aleatory music include klavierst karlheinz stockhausen which features elements performed sequence determined each case the performer boehmer form limited aleatory was used witold awski beginning with jeux nitiens rae where extensive passages pitches and rhythms are fully but the rhythmic coordination parts within the ensemble subject element there has been much confusion the terms aleatory and chance one hpschd itself composed using chance uses music from musikalisches rfelspiel referred well original types indeterminate music indeterminacy some writers not make distinction between chance and indeterminancy and use the terms interchangeably griffiths joe and song roig from this point indeterminate chance music can divided into three the use random procedures produce fixed mobile and indeterminate including graphic notation and texts griffiths the first group includes scores which the chance element involved only the process that every parameter fixed before their john cage music changes for the composer selected tempo and dynamics using the ching ancient chinese book which prescribes methods for arriving random numbers joe and song because this work absolutely fixed from performance cage regarded entirely determinate work made using chance procedures pritchett the level iannis xenakis used probability theories define some microscopic aspects pithoprakta which greek for actions means this work contains four characterized textural and timbral such glissandi and the macroscopic the sections are designed and controlled the composer while the single components sound are controlled mathematical theories joe and song vague the second type indeterminate chance elements involve the notated events are provided the but their arrangement left the determination the karlheinz stockhausen klavierst presents nineteen events which are composed and notated traditional but the arrangement these events determined the performer spontaneously during the earle brown available forms the conductor asked decide the order the events the very moment the performance joe and song this second type control and chance merged some works the late one type music which this might occur called sound mass composition textural composition where individual pitches and lines are integrated into complexes sound sound sound masses not perceive individual but rather chromatically filled complexes these sound blocks may result from minutely notated chromatic lines that fuse into each other and then the sound masses are constant motion and gyorgy ligeti atmosph res they may result from more static clusters blocks sound made adjacent chromatic microtonal krzysztof penderecki threnody for the victims hiroshima clusters are notated pitch pitch conventional whereas other times they are indicated usually means solid black bands the mass musical elements such density register dynamics and instrumental color replace such musical parameters meter lines chords and usually considered primary more traditional compositional context vague the greatest degree indeterminacy reached the third type indeterminate where traditional musical notation replaced visual verbal signs suggesting how work can for example graphic score pieces earle december shows lines and rectangles various lengths and thicknesses that can read duration the performer chooses how read another example morton feldman intersection for piano written coordinate time unit are represented the squares viewed while relative pitch levels middle and low are indicated three vertical squares each the performer determines what particular pitches and rhythms play joe and song open chance music open form open form term sometimes used for mobile polyvalent musical forms where the order movements sections indeterminate left the performer roman ramati composed series influential mobiles such interpolation however open music also used the sense defined the art historian heinrich lfflin kunstgeschichtliche grundbegriffe mean work which fundamentally represents unfinished points outside this mobile can either open closed example closed mobile musical composition zyklus terry riley was composed short each member the ensemble can repeat given sequence many times desired before going the making the details each performance unique however because the overall course closed citation needed film music examples extensive aleatoric writing can found small passages from john williams score
