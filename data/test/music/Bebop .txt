coleman hawkins important antecedent hawkins willingness even from the ordinary resolution musical themes and his playful jumps time signaled departure from existing the recording was but more from historical hawkins became inspiration younger generation jazz most notably charlie parker kansas city the the younger generation jazz musicians created new style that came out the swing they partially strove counter the popularization swing with danceable music that demanded mavericks like dizzy gillespie charlie parker bud powell and thelonious monk were influenced the preceding adventurous such pianists art tatum and earl hines tenor saxophonists coleman hawkins and lester young and trumpeter roy eldridge gillespie and both out the earl hines band chicago had traveled with some the bop including jack teagarden earl hines and jay mcshann while gillespie was with cab calloway practiced with bassist milt hinton and developed some the key harmonic and chordal innovations that would the cornerstones the new charlie parker did the same with bassist gene ramey while with these forerunners the new music which would later termed bebop bop although parker himself never used the feeling demeaned the began exploring advanced complex altered and chord the bop musicians advanced these techniques with more intricate and often arcane minton playhouse new york served incubator and experimental theater for early bebop including don byas thelonious monk and charlie christian who had already hinted the bop style innovative solos with benny goodman part the atmosphere created jams like the ones found playhouse was air the regular musicians would often reharmonize the standards order exclude those whom they considered outsiders simply weaker christian major influence was the realm rhythmic phrasing christian commonly emphasized weak beats and off and often ended his phrases the second half the fourth christian experimented with asymmetrical which was become core element the new bop swing improvisation was commonly constructed two four bar phrases that corresponded the harmonic cadences the underlying song bop improvisers would often deploy phrases over odd number and overlap their phrases across bar lines and across major harmonic christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating harmony their improvised line before appeared the song form being outlined the rhythm this momentary dissonance creates strong sense forward motion the swing improvisers commonly emphasized the first and third beats but bebop composition such dizzy gillespie salt peanuts the rhythmic emphasis switches the second and fourth beats the such new rhythmic phrasing techniques give the typical bop solo feeling floating free over the underlying song rather than being tied into the song swing drummers had kept steady bar pulse the bass bop led kenny clarke moved the keeping function the ride hat reserving the bass drum for bass drum accents were colloquially termed dropping notable bop drummers such max roach shadow wilson philly joe jones roy haynes and kenny clarke began support and respond almost like shifting call and response this change increased the importance the string now the bass not only maintained the harmonic but also became responsible for establishing metronomic rhythmic foundation playing walking bass line four quarter notes the while small swing ensembles commonly functioned without the new bop style required bass every small second wave bebop such clifford brown and sonny stitt began smooth out the rhythmic eccentricities early instead using jagged phrasing create rhythmic the early boppers these musicians constructed their improvised lines out long strings eighth and simply accented certain notes the line create rhythmic musical style bebop differed drastically from the straightforward compositions the swing and was instead characterized fast asymmetrical intricate melodies and rhythm sections that expanded their role the music itself seemed jarringly different the ears the who were used the organized danceable tunes benny goodman and glenn miller during the swing instead bebop appeared sound nervous erratic and often but jazz musicians and jazz music bebop was exciting and beautiful revolution the art was label that certain journalists later gave but never labeled the was just modern would call call really just kenny clarke while swing music tended feature orchestrated big band bebop music highlighted typically theme often the main melody pop jazz standard the swing would presented together the beginning and the end each with improvisational solos based the chords the thus the majority song bebop style would the only threads holding the work together being the underlying harmonies played the rhythm section sometimes improvisation included references the original melody other known melodic lines quotes riffs sometimes they were entirely spontaneous melodies from start chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular era songs and reused with new and more complex forming new this practice was already established earlier but came central the bebop the style made use several relatively common chord such blues but infused with and rhythm the chords the pop standard got rhythm late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented departure from pop and show bebop musicians also employed several harmonic devices not typical previous complicated harmonic substitutions for more basic chords became these substitutions often emphasized certain dissonant intervals such the flat sharp the sharp tritone this unprecedented harmonic development which took place bebop often traced back transcendent moment experienced charlie parker while performing cherokee clark uptown new early described been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being and kept thinking bound something could hear play was working over and found that using the higher intervals chord melody line and backing them with appropriately related could play the thing been came gerhard kubik postulates that the harmonic development bebop sprung from the blues and other related tonal rather than twentieth century western art some have kubik auditory inclinations were the african legacy life reconfirmed the experience the blues tonal sound world odds with the western diatonic chord categories bebop musicians eliminated style functional harmony their music while retaining the strong central tonality the blues basis for drawing upon various african

and even more highly linear rhythmic complexity and melodic angularity which the blue note the fifth degree was established important harmonic the reestablishment the blues the primary organizing and functional while for outside the harmonic innovations bebop would appear inspired experiences western serious music from claude debussy arnold schoenberg such scheme cannot sustained the evidence from cognitive claude debussy did have some influence for bix beiderbecke piano and also true that duke ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices european contemporary west coast jazz would run into such debts would several forms cool jazz but bebop has hardly any such debts the sense direct the ideologically bebop was strong statement rejection any kind propelled desire activate something deeply buried bebop then revived harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others basically western harmonic the ultimate significance all this that the experiments jazz during the brought back american music several structural principles and techniques rooted african instrumentation street the classic bebop combo consisted saxophone trumpet bass drums and piano this was format used and both charlie parker alto sax and dizzy gillespie trumpet their groups and sometimes augmented extra saxophonist guitar electric occasionally adding other horns
