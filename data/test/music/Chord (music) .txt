different categories this tertian chords can decomposed into series major thirds for the major triad defined sequence two the first being major third and the second being minor third most common chords are tertian secundal chords can decomposed into series major seconds for the chord series containing major second and minor second quartal chords can decomposed into series perfect fourths for the chord series containing perfect fourth and augmented fourth tritone these terms can become ambiguous when dealing with diatonic scales such the pentatonic chromatic scales the use accidentals can

fourth create one the following illustrated here the key italian augmented french augmented german augmented the augmented sixth family chords exhibits certain since they are not based are seventh chords and other sixth they are not generally regarded having roots therefore inversions although one voicing the notes common with the namesake interval inverted create diminished the second group sixth chords includes inverted major and minor which may called sixth chords that the six three and six four chords contain intervals sixth with the bass though this not the nowadays this mostly for academic study analysis see figured but the neapolitan sixth chord important major triad with flat supertonic scale degree its root that called sixth because almost always found first though technically accurate roman numeral analysis would generally labelled the chord notated from root because uses chromatically altered tones this chord often grouped with the borrowed chords see below

the chord with the notes the name suspended derives from early polyphonic technique developed during the common practice period which stepwise melodic progress harmonically stable note any particular part was often momentarily delayed suspended extending the duration the previous the resulting unexpected dissonance could then all the more satisfyingly resolved the eventual appearance the displaced traditional music theory the inclusion the third either chord would negate the such chords would called added ninth and added eleventh chords modern layman usage the term restricted the displacement the third only and the dissonant second fourth longer needs held over prepared from the previous neither now obligatory for the displaced note make appearance all though the majority cases the conventional stepwise resolution the third still post bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used nontraditional these often not function chords and not
