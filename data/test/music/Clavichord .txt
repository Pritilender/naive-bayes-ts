tangent against the string known bebung when the key the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration the string silenced strips damping the action the clavichord unique among all keyboard instruments that one part the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while the same time defining the endpoint the vibrating and thus its because this intimate contact between the hand and the production the clavichord has been referred the most intimate keyboard despite its many limitations including extremely low has considerable expressive the player being able control duration volume and even provide certain subtle effects swelling tone and type vibrato unique the fretting hass since the string vibrates from the bridge only far the multiple keys with multiple tangents can assigned the same this called fretting early clavichords frequently had many notes played each even going far the keyed monochord instrument with only one though most clavichords were since only one note can played time each the fretting pattern generally chosen that notes rarely heard together such and share string the advantages this system compared with unfretted instruments see include relative ease tuning with around half many strings keep greater volume though still not really enough for use chamber music and more direct among the temperament could not set without bending the and playing required further refinement since notes sharing single string played quick succession had slightly separated avoid disagreeable deadening the potentially disturbing legato line namur belgium some clavichords have been built with single pair strings for each the first known reference one was johann speth and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built johann michael such instruments are referred unfretted whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called fretted among the advantages unfretted instruments are flexibility tuning the temperament can easily and the ability play any music exactly written without concern for bad notes disadvantages include smaller even though many most unfretted instruments tend significantly larger than fretted and many more strings keep unfretted instruments tend have less incisive tone due the greater load the bridge resulting from the greater number though the late early swedish clavichords tend the loudest
