chords and intervals and melody tonality and even rhythm and metre although there are physical and neurological facts important understanding the idea the precise definition dissonance culturally conditioned definitions and conventions usage related dissonance vary greatly among different musical traditions and nevertheless the basic ideas consonance and resolution exist some form all musical traditions that have concept harmony dissonance being the complement consonance may coincidence lack fusion pattern additional confusion about the idea dissonance created the fact that musicians and writers sometimes use the word dissonance and related terms precise and carefully defined more often informal and very often metaphorical sense rhythmic for many musicians and the essential ideas dissonance and resolution are vitally important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking number despite the fact that words like unpleasant and grating are often used explain the sound all music with harmonic tonal even music perceived generally incorporates some degree the buildup and release tension dissonance and which can occur every level from the subtle the partially responsible for what listeners perceive emotion and expressiveness dissonance and musical style the concept dissonance does not belong the domain harmony presented nature harmonic but derived from voice leading which essential constituent art heinrich schenker understanding particular musical treatment dissonance what considered dissonant and what rules procedures govern how dissonant chords notes are treated key understanding that particular for harmony generally governed which are collections notes defined tolerably consonant the there however hierarchy with some considered more consonant and some more any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony considered given style typically pays attention how its musical structure approaches dissonance steps less leap more and even more how they resolve almost always how they fit within the meter and rhythm dissonances strong beats are more those weaker beats less and how they lie within the phrase dissonances tend resolve dissonance traditional music sharp dissonant intervals and chords play prominent role many traditional musical vocal polyphonic traditions from bulgaria serbia bosnia herzegovina albania latvia georgia nuristan

schwebungsdiaphonie dissonance history western music dissonances lorenz mizler dissonance has been understood and heard differently different musical cultures styles and time relaxation and tension have been used analogy since the time aristotle till the present early renaissance music intervals such the perfect fourth were considered dissonances that must immediately the regola delle terze seste rule thirds and required that imperfect consonances should resolve perfect one step progression one voice and step progression another dahlhaus anonymous allowed two the optima introductio three and anonymous four five successive imperfect the end the imperfect consonances were longer tension but evidenced the allowance their successions argued for adam von fulda independent according gerbert although older scholars once would forbid all sequences more than three four imperfect who are more modern allow the common practice period musical style required preparation for all followed and then resolution there was also distinction between melodic and harmonic dissonance dissonant melodic intervals included the tritone and all augmented and diminished intervals dissonant harmonic intervals minor second and major seventh augmented fourth and diminished fifth enharmonically equivalent tritone thus western musical history can seen progressing from limited definition consonance wider definition early only intervals low the overtone series were considered time intervals ever higher the overtone series were considered the final result this was the called emancipation the dissonance the words arnold schoenberg some century early century american composer henry cowell viewed tone clusters the use higher and higher despite the fact that this idea the historical progression towards the acceptance ever greater levels dissonance somewhat oversimplified and glosses over important developments the history western the general idea was attractive many century modernist composers and

entirely within the context harmonic timbres produced vibrating strings and columns which the dominant musical instruments are generalizing notion consonance described above the coincidence embrace harmonic timbres and their related consonance has recently been emancipated from harmonic timbres and their related tunings milne sethares using electronically controlled harmonic rather than strictly harmonic acoustic provides tonality with new structural resources such dynamic tonality these new resources provide musicians with alternative pursuing the musical uses higher partials harmonic

attractive part the musical timbre and equally great lengths create instruments that produce this slight roughness sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations beating and are both closely related sound amplitude amplitude fluctuations describe variations the maximum value sound signals relative reference point and are the result wave interference the interference principle states that the combined amplitude two more vibrations any given time may larger constructive smaller destructive than the amplitude the individual vibrations depending their phase the case two more waves with different their periodically changing phase relationship results periodic alterations between constructive and destructive giving rise the phenomenon amplitude amplitude fluctuations can placed three overlapping perceptual categories related the rate slow amplitude fluctuations per are perceived loudness fluctuations referred the rate fluctuation the loudness appears and the fluctuations are perceived fluttering the amplitude fluctuation rate increased the roughness reaches maximum strength and then gradually diminishes until disappears fluctuations per depending the frequency the interfering assuming the ear performs frequency analysis incoming indicated ohm acoustic law see helmholtz plomp the above perceptual categories can related directly the bandwidth the hypothetical analysis filters zwicker zwicker for the simplest case amplitude fluctuations resulting from the addition two sine signals with frequencies and the fluctuation rate equal the frequency difference between the two sines and the following statements represent the general the fluctuation rate smaller than the filter then single tone perceived either with fluctuating loudness with the fluctuation rate larger than the filter then complex tone which one more pitches can assigned but exhibits beating along with amplitude fluctuation the second most important signal parameter related the perceptions beating and roughness the degree amplitude that the level difference between peaks and valleys signal terhardt vassilakis the degree amplitude fluctuation depends the relative amplitudes the components the with interfering tones equal amplitudes resulting the highest fluctuation degree and therefore the highest beating roughness for fluctuation rates comparable the auditory filter the rate and shape complex amplitude fluctuations are variables that are manipulated musicians various cultures exploit the beating and roughness making amplitude fluctuation significant expressive tool the production musical otherwise when there pronounced beating the rate and shape complex amplitude fluctuations remain through their interaction with the spectral this interaction manifested
