mounting during the early and later drummers further developed this instrument into the mounted horizontal nearly horizontally mounted crash cymbals modern drum kit however most modern drum kits not employ leather strap suspension many modern drum kits use mount with felt otherwise dampening fabric act barrier hold the cymbals between metal thus forming the modern day ride suspended cymbals can
