and roll are also like habana rockoson revolutionary cuba and cuban exiles the triumph the cuban revolution signalled the emigration many musicians puerto rico florida and new york and cuba artists and their work came under the protection and the socialist and the monopoly owned recording company egrem the castro government abolished copyright laws closed many the venues where popular music used played night and indirectly threw many musicians out this undoubtedly had deleterious effects the evolution popular music and many young musicians now studied classical music and not popular all musicians employed the state were given college courses the nueva trova movement including pablo reflected the new leftist the state took over the lucrative tropicana club which continued popular attraction for foreign tourists until when was closed along with many other music venues and later reopened with the rebirth tourism was almost existent for three traditional cuban music could found local casas musicians were time and paid the state after graduating from the collapse the ussr and the loss its support for cuba changed the situation quite tourism became respectable and did popular music for their musicians were even allowed tour abroad and earn living outside the run famous artists from the cuban exile include celia cruz and the whole conjunto she sang the sonora matancera carlos valdes cachao lupe arturo sandoval willy chirino hansel palabra paquito rivera bebo and gloria estefan are some many these especially became closely associated with the revolutionary and unpersons have been omitted from the standard cuban reference and their subsequent musical recordings are never sale son cuba salsa music son cuba was the fourth innovation based cuban music hit the and differed that was initially developed the not because cuba has many indigenous types music there has always been problem marketing the abroad people who did not understand the differences between rhythms are quite twice the kind product label was developed solve this the first occasion was the after the peanut vendor became international was called even though really had nothing with genuine the number was obviously son pregon the label was used outside cuba for years all for cuban popular the second occasion happened during the period new york musicians cuban and rican origin combined produce the great music the post cha this music acquired the label one really knows how this but everyone recognised what benefit was have common label for mambo guaracha guijira guaguanco cubans and non such tito puentes ruben blades and many experts the cuban music and salsa have always said salsa just another name for music tito puentes once now they call later they may call stir but will alway cuban but over time salsa bands worked other for the late willie developed numbers that made use brazilian new york radio programmes offered further like good cook willie colon you look band the playing cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments salsa later still salsa was the label for especially sugary type bolero even benny perez prado the greatest sonero that ever was singing boleros with salsa cadence the was not until the that cuban music became popular for puerto rican plena bomba other styles music were popular the time puerto many famous puerto rican musicians went learn the music styles cubans the and and was not until the arrival castro and the cuban music stopped its exportation the that puerto ricans new york were able greatly but what known salsa was brought new york the and dizzy and chano pozo this last one was discovered dizzy was one the greatest percussionist that ever the question whether not salsa anything more than cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty initially not much difference could later became clear that not only was new york salsa different from popular music but salsa colombia and other countries could also also seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position achieved the late the reasons for this are also much nueva trova nueva trova trova santiago cuba paralleling nueva latin america the cuban nueva trova which dates from about after the cuban revolution differed from the traditional trova not because the musicians were but because the content the widest political nueva trova defined its connection with castro and its which attempt escape the banalities life concentrating injustice sexism colonialism racism and similar silvio guez and pablo became the most important exponents this carlos puebla and jose ndez were time old trova singers who added their weight the new but the two only puebla wrote special revolution nueva trova had its heyday the but was already declining before the fall the soviet examples political styles the nueva trova movement can for liuba hevia whose lyrics are focused more traditional subjects such love and sharing with the rest highly poetical the other side the carlos varela famous cuba for his open criticism some aspects the nueva initially suffered both inside perhaps from growing disenchantment with party and from the vivid contrast with the buena vista social club film and audiences round the world have had their eyes opened the extraordinary charm and musical quality the older forms cuban topical themes that seemed relevant the and now seem dry and even guantanamera has been damaged repetition less skilled all the those pieces high musical and lyrical among which hasta siempre comandante stands will probably last long cuba the present son remains the basis most popular forms modern cuban son represented standing groups like septeto nacional which was established orquesta orquesta ritmo oriental and orquesta original manzanillo sierra maestra famous for having sparked revival traditional son the nueva trova still has but the overtly political themes the are well out meanwhile irakere fused traditional cuban music with jazz and groups like banda orishas and son continued add new elements especially hip hop and funk form timba music this process was aided the acquisition imported electronic there are still many practitioners traditional son montuno such eliades ochoa who have recorded and toured widely result interest the son montuno after the buena vista social club the increased interest world music coincided with the soviet union periodo especial during which the economy began opening orquesta charanga habanera and ndido banda have been time players the charanga and helped form the popular timba scene the late the biggest award modern cuban music the beny award timba timba cubans have never been content hear their music described salsa even though crystal clear that this was label for their for the most timba equals salsa cubana though there are claims that something since the early timba has been used describe popular dance music rivalled only lately though derived from the same roots timba has its own and intimately tied the life and culture and especially buena vista social club buena vista social club true watershed event was the release buena vista social club recording veteran cuban musicians organized the american musician and cooder buena vista social club became immense worldwide selling millions and made stars octogenarian cuban musicians such ibrahim ferrer rub lez and compay segundo buena vista resulted several followup recordings and spawned film the same name well tremendous interest other cuban subsequent dozens singers and conjuntos made recordings for foreign labels and toured the conclusion some have drawn that the wholesale closure popular music venues after the which threw many musicians out and subsequent control state damaged the development cuban popular rap hop from usa after the collapse the soviet the cuban economy went into poverty became more widespread and visible the some cubans start protest this situation means rap and the rappers become revolution within hip hop used describe life and during the special period after the collapse the soviet the cuban government then took steps improve the tourism was mildly and music venues started cater for visitors well before tourists were quite when hop the cuban government opposed the vulgar image that rappers but later accepted that might better have hop under the influence the ministry culture authentic expression cuban unlike which indigenous dance rap music cuba culturally foreign although some rap groups have prided themselves remaining loyal true hip hop others like the orishas the only cuban rap group succeed latin have been criticized for using salsa rhythms generate commercial government and hop hip hop being tolerated the government cuba something out the because performers are provided with venues and equipment the the cuban rap and hop scene sought out the involvement the ministry culture the production and promotion their which would otherwise have been impossible after the cuban government provided warm the cuban rap agency provided the cuban rap with sponsored record magazine and own hop under this the government gives rap and hop groups time mass media outlets return for hop artists limiting expression and presenting the government positive the hop artists talk about everyday life however most critics believe that the cuban rap agency will hide opinions the cuban the government evidently recognises that rap and hop growing and would difficult impossible citation needed cubat like spanish reggae from panama new genre for the cubans but
