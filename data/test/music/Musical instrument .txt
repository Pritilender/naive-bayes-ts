instruments based their complexity since advancements musical instruments have sometimes reduced for construction early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large later slit drums were made opening bamboo much simpler german musicologist curt sachs one the most prominent musicologists and musical ethnologists modern argues that misleading arrange the development musical instruments workmanship since cultures advance different rates and have access different raw for that contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed the same time but differed culture and handicraft cannot determine which instruments are more primitive ordering instruments geography also not totally cannot always determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared sachs proposed that geographical chronology until approximately however due its limited beyond one can follow the overall development musical instruments time the science marking the order musical instrument development relies archaeological artistic and literary since data one research path can all three paths provide better historical primitive and prehistoric aztec teponaztli until the century european written music histories began with mythological accounts how musical instruments were such accounts included jubal descendant cain and father all such handle the harp and the pan inventor the pan pipes and mercury who said have made dried tortoise shell into the first lyre modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological occasionally informed archeological scholars agree that there was definitive invention the musical instrument since the definition the term musical completely subjective both the scholar and the for homo habilis slapping his body could the makings musical instrument regardless the among the first devices external the human body that are considered instruments are rattles stampers and various drums these earliest instruments evolved due the human motor impulse add sound emotional movements such eventually some cultures assigned ritual functions their musical using them for hunting and various those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such ribbon flutes and some these labels carry far different connotations from those used modern early flutes and trumpets are labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance modern among early cultures for whom drums developed even sacred importance are the chukchi people the russian far east the indigenous people melanesia and many cultures africa drums were pervasive throughout every african one east african the wahinda believed was holy that seeing drum would fatal any person other than the humans eventually developed the concept using musical instruments for producing melody until this time the evolutions musical melody was common only similar the process reduplication instrument players first developed repetition and then early form melody was produced pounding two stamping tubes slightly different one tube would produce clear sound and the other would answer with darker sound such instrument pairs also included bullroarers slit shell and skin cultures who used these instrument pairs associated genders with the father was the bigger more energetic while the mother was the smaller duller musical instruments existed this form for thousands years before patterns three more tones would evolve the form the earliest xylophone xylophones originated the mainland and archipelago southeast asia eventually spreading the and along with which ranged from simple sets three leg carefully tuned sets parallel various cultures developed instruments such the ground harp ground zither musical bow and jaw harp antiquity images musical instruments begin appear mesopotamian artifacts beginning around sumerian and babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes musical instruments due division labor and the evolving class popular simple and playable evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused effectiveness and despite this very few musical instruments have been recovered mesopotamia scholars must rely artifacts and cuneiform texts written sumerian akkadian reconstruct the early history musical instruments even the process assigning names these instruments challenging since there clear distinction among various instruments and the words used describe although sumerian and babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial historians have been able distinguish six idiophones used early concussion clappers sistra bells cymbals and sistra are depicted prominently great relief amenhotep iii and are particular interest because similar designs have been found reaching places such tbilisi georgia and among the native american yaqui tribe the people mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments any evidenced their proliferation mesopotamian plaques and innumerable varieties harps are well lyres and the forerunner modern stringed instruments such the violin ancient egyptian dynasty musical instruments used the egyptian culture before bore striking similarity those leading historians conclude that the civilizations must have been contact with one sachs notes that egypt did not possess any instruments that the sumerian culture did not also however the cultural contacts seem have the prominent ceremonial instrument did not appear egypt for another years clappers and concussion sticks appear egyptian vases early the civilization also made use vertical double arched and angular and various little history available the period between and egypt and babylon entered long violent period war and this period saw the kassites destroy the babylonian empire mesopotamia and the hyksos destroy the middle kingdom egypt when the pharaohs egypt conquered southwest asia around the cultural ties mesopotamia were renewed and musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from asiatic under their new cultural the people the new kingdom began using trumpets lyres lutes castanets and contrast with mesopotamia and professional musicians did not exist israel between and while the history musical instruments mesopotamia and egypt relies artistic the culture israel produced few such scholars must therefore rely information gleaned from the bible and the talmud the hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with jubal ugabs and kinnors these may translated pan pipes and respectively other instruments the period included frame small bells jingles called shofars and the like the introduction monarchy israel during the century produced the first professional musicians and with them drastic increase the number and variety musical however identifying and classifying the instruments remains challenge due the lack artistic for stringed instruments uncertain design called nevals and asors but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define her book survey musical instruments american musicologist sibyl marcuse proposes that the nevel must similar vertical harp due its relation nabla the phoenician term for harp greece rome and etruria the use and development musical instruments stood stark contrast those achievements architecture and the instruments the time were simple and virtually all them were imported from other lyres were the principal musicians used them honor the greeks played variety wind instruments they classified aulos syrinx greek writing from that time reflects serious study reed production and playing romans played reed instruments named tibia featuring holes that could opened allowing for greater flexibility playing other instruments common use the region included vertical harps derived from those the orient lutes egyptian various pipes and and which were played primarily evidence musical instruments use early civilizations india almost completely making impossible reliably attribute instruments the munda and dravidian language speaking cultures that first settled the rather the history musical instruments the area begins with the indus valley civilization that emerged around various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence musical clay statuette indicates the use and examination the indus script has also revealed representations vertical arched harps identical design those depicted sumerian this discovery among many indications that the indus valley and sumerian cultures maintained cultural subsequent developments musical instruments india occurred with the rigveda these songs used various shell harps and other prominent instruments use during the early centuries were the snake double clarinet bagpipes barrel cross and short india had unique musical instruments until the middle ages musical instruments such zithers appeared chinese writings around century and early chinese philosophers such confucius mencius and laozi shaped the development musical instruments adopting attitude toward music similar that the the chinese believed that music was essential part character and and developed unique system classifying their musical instruments according their material idiophones were extremely important chinese hence the majority early instruments were poetry the shang dynasty mentions chimes drums and globular flutes carved from the latter which has been excavated and preserved the zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such troughs wooden fish and wind instruments such pan pitch and mouth organs also appeared this time the xiao and various other instruments that spread through many came into use china during and after the han dynasty although civilizations central america attained relatively high level sophistication the eleventh century they lagged behind other civilizations the development musical for they had stringed all their instruments were drums and wind instruments such flutes and only the flute was capable producing pre columbian south american civilizations areas such day peru colombia ecuador bolivia and chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced south american cultures the time used pipes well varieties idiophones drums and shell wood middle ages during the period time loosely

turkestan influences from middle persia india mongolia and other countries chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period those regions and cymbals gained along with more advanced clarinets oboes flutes drums and some the first zithers appeared china the influenced mongolian india experienced similar development china the middle however stringed instruments developed differently they accommodated different styles while stringed instruments china were designed produce precise tones capable matching the tones stringed instruments india were considerably more this flexibility suited the slides and tremolos hindu rhythm was paramount importance indian music the evidenced the frequent depiction drums reliefs dating the middle the emphasis rhythm aspect native indian historians divide the development musical instruments medieval india between islamic and islamic periods due the different influence each period islamic idiophones such hand cymbals and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use hindu the like instrument was bronze disk that was struck with hammer instead tubular stick zithers named veena short double and triple coiled

the despite the influences greece and most musical instruments europe during the middles ages came from the lyre the only musical instrument that may have been invented europe until this stringed instruments were prominent middle age the central and northern regions used mainly stringed instruments with necks while the southern region used which featured armed body and various harps served central and northern europe far north where the harp eventually became national lyres propagated through the same far east estonia european music between and became more more frequently requiring instruments capable polyphony the persian geographer the century ibn khordadbeh mentioned his lexicographical discussion music instruments that the byzantine empire typical instruments included the urghun organ shilyani probably type harp lyre salandj probably bagpipe and the byzantine lyra lyra was medieval pear shaped bowed string instrument with three five strings held upright and ancestor most european bowed including the violin the monochord served precise measure the notes musical allowing more accurate musical mechanical hurdy gurdies allowed single musicians play more complicated arrangements than fiddle both were prominent folk instruments the middle southern europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended the unlike the facing pegs central and northern european idiophones such bells and clappers served various practical such warning the approach leper the ninth century revealed the first bagpipes which spread throughout europe and had many uses from folk instruments military the construction pneumatic organs evolved europe starting fifth century spain spreading england about the resulting instruments varied size and use from portable organs worn around the neck large pipe literary accounts organs being played english benedictine abbeys toward the end the tenth century are the first references organs being connected reed players the middle ages were limited evidence clarinets exists during this modern renaissance musical instrument development was dominated the occident from indeed the most profound changes occurred during the renaissance period instruments took other purposes than accompanying singing and performers used them solo keyboards and lutes developed polyphonic and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature composers also began designing pieces music for specific the latter half the sixteenth orchestration came into common practice method writing music for variety composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own the polyphonic style dominated popular and the instrument makers responded the duet cornelis saftleven beginning about the rate development musical instruments increased earnest compositions demanded more dynamic people also began writing books about playing and cataloging musical the first such book was sebastian treatise musica getuscht und ausgezogen music germanized and abstracted virdung work noted being particularly thorough for including descriptions irregular instruments such horns and cow though virdung critical the other books including arnolt spiegel der orgelmacher und organisten mirror organ makers and organ players the following treatise organ building and organ the instructional books and references published the renaissance one noted for its detailed description and depiction all wind and stringed including their relative this the syntagma musicum michael now considered authoritative reference sixteenth century musical the sixteenth musical instrument builders gave most such the the classical they retain emphasis aesthetic beauty also listeners were pleased with the physical appearance instrument they were with its therefore builders paid special attention materials and and instruments became collectibles homes and was during this period that makers began constructing instruments the same type various sizes meet the demand consorts ensembles playing works written for these groups instrument builders developed other features that endure for while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already the first organs with solo stops emerged the early fifteenth these stops were meant produce mixture development needed for the complexity music the trumpets evolved into their modern form improve and players used mutes properly blend into chamber music baroque jacob stainer beginning the seventeenth composers began creating works more emotional they felt that monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human many instruments that were incapable larger ranges and and therefore were seen fell out one such instrument was the bowed instruments such the viola baryton and various lutes dominated popular beginning around however the lute disappeared from musical compositions favor the rising popularity the guitar the prevalence string orchestras rose wind instruments such the oboe and bassoon were readmitted counteract the monotony hearing only the seventeenth what was known horn underwent transformation into art consisting lengthened narrower wider and much wider the details this transformation are but the modern horn more french had emerged the slide trumpet variation that includes throated mouthpiece that slid and allowing the player infinite adjustments pitch this variation the trumpet was unpopular due the difficulty involved playing organs underwent tonal changes the baroque manufacturers such abraham jordan london made the stops more expressive and added devices such expressive sachs viewed this trend degeneration the general organ classical and romantic during the classical and romantic periods lasting from roughly great deal musical instruments capable producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular the design changes that broadened the quality timbres allowed instruments produce wider variety large orchestras rose popularity the composers determined produce entire orchestral scores that made use the expressive abilities modern since instruments were involved collaborations much larger their designs had evolve accommodate the demands the some instruments also had become louder fill larger halls and heard over sizable flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design most them efforts increase other instruments were changed just they could play their parts the trumpets traditionally had defective range they were incapable producing certain notes with new instruments such the saxophone and tuba became fixtures instruments such the clarinet also grew into entire families instruments capable different small normal bass and accompanying the changes timbre and volume was shift the typical pitch used tune instruments meant play must tuned the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same beginning the average concert pitch began rising from low vibrations high vienna different countries and even instrument manufacturers preferred different making orchestral collaboration despite even the efforts two organized international summits attended noted composers like hector berlioz standard could agreed twentieth century present the evolution traditional musical instruments slowed beginning the twentieth instruments like the flute french harp and are largely the same those manufactured throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth gradual iterations for the new violin began provide differently sized violins expand the range available the slowdown development was practical response the concurrent slowdown orchestra and venue despite this trend traditional the development new musical instruments exploded the twentieth the sheer variety instruments developed overshadows any prior the proliferation electricity the twentieth century lead the creation entirely new category musical electronic electrophones the vast majority electrophones produced the first half the twentieth century were what sachs called electromechanical other they have mechanical parts that produce sound and those vibrations are picked and amplified electrical examples electromechanical instruments include organs and electric sachs also defined subcategory radioelectric such the theremin which produces music through the hand movements around two the latter half the twentieth century saw the gradual evolution synthesizers instruments that artificially produce sound using analog digital circuits and the late bob moog and other inventors began era development commercial one the first these instruments was the moog synthesizer the modern proliferation computers and microchips has spawned entire industry around electronic musical since electronic musical instruments may produce sound without human there debate the modern music community whether not computer musicians may considered citation needed classification musical instrument classification there are many different methods classifying musical various methods examine aspects such the physical properties the instrument color shape etc the use for the the means which music produced with the the range the and the place orchestra other most methods are specific geographic area cultural group and were developed serve the unique classification requirements the the problem with these specialized classification schemes that they tend break down once they are applied outside their original for system based instrument use would fail culture invented new use for the same scholars recognize sachs the only system that applies any culture more provides only possible classification for each ancient systems ancient system named the natya shastra written the sage bharata muni and dating from between and divides instruments into four main classification instruments where the sound produced vibrating percussion instruments with skin instruments where the sound produced vibrating columns and solid percussion this system was adapted some degree century europe johannes who used the terms tensibilia stringed inflatibilia wind and percussibilia all percussion victor charles mahillon adapted the natya shastra and assigned greek labels the four chordophones stringed membranophones head percussion aerophones wind and autophones skin percussion hornbostel sachs erich von hornbostel and curt sachs adopted scheme and published extensive new scheme for classification zeitschrift ethnologie hornbostel and sachs used most but replaced the term autophone with idiophone the original sachs system classified instruments into four main idiophones which produce sound vibrating the primary body the instrument they are sorted into percussion shaken scraped split and plucked such claves xylophone guiro slit drum mbira and rattle membranophones which produce sound vibrating stretched they may drums further sorted the shape the which are struck with but kazoos and other instruments that use stretched membrane for the primary sound not simply modify sound produced another are also considered chordophones which produce sound vibrating one more they are sorted into according the relationship between the and the sounding board for the strings are laid out parallel the sounding board and there the instrument zither whether plucked like autoharp struck with hammers like piano the instrument has strings parallel the sounding board chamber and the strings extend past the board with then the instrument lute whether the sound chamber constructed wood like guitar uses membrane like banjo aerophones which produce sound with vibrating column they are sorted into free aerophones such bullroarer whip which move freely through the flutes which cause the air pass over sharp reed which use vibrating and vibrated aerophones such trumpets for which the lips themselves function vibrating sachs later added fifth electrophones such theremins which produce sound electronic within each category are many the system has been criticised and revised over the but remains widely used ethnomusicologists and organologists schaeffner andre curator the mus homme disagreed with the sachs system and developed his own system schaeffner believed that the pure physics musical rather than its specific construction playing should always determine its for divide aerophones the basis sound but membranophones the basis the shape the his system divided instruments into two instruments with vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating range instrument range musical instruments are also often classified their musical range comparison with other instruments the same this exercise useful when placing instruments context orchestra other these terms are named after singing voice soprano instruments flute violin soprano saxophone trumpet clarinet oboe piccolo alto instruments alto saxophone french horn english horn viola alto horn tenor instruments trombone tenor saxophone guitar tenor drum baritone instruments bassoon baritone saxophone bass clarinet cello baritone horn euphonium bass instruments double bass bass guitar bass saxophone tuba bass drum some instruments fall into more than one for the cello may considered baritone depending how its music fits into the and the trombone may tenor baritone bass and the french bass baritone tenor depending the range played many instruments have

saxophone contrabass clarinet when used the name these terms are describing the range comparison other instruments its family and not comparison the human voice range instruments other for bass range from while bass clarinet plays about one octave construction the materials used making musical instruments vary greatly culture and many the materials have special significance owing their source some cultures worked substances from the human body into their ancient for the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial new drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used attach the membrane mulberry trees are held high regard china owing their mythological instrument makers would hence use them make the yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck lightning gives them special connection musical instrument construction specialized trade that requires years practice and sometimes most makers musical instruments specialize one genre for luthier makes only stringed some make only one type instrument such whatever the instrument the instrument maker must consider construction and creating balanced instrument that both functional and aesthetically some builders are focused more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments often meant for individual playing styles developed the builder user interfaces regardless how the sound instrument many musical instruments have keyboard the keyboard instruments are any instruments that are played with musical keyboard every key generates one more most keyboard instruments have extra means pedals for stops for manipulate these they may produce sound wind being fanned organ pumped accordion vibrating strings either hammered piano plucked harpsichord electronic means synthesizer some other sometimes instruments that not usually have such the glockenspiel are fitted with though they have moving parts and are struck mallets held the they have the same physical arrangement keys and produce soundwaves similar see also list musical instruments folk instrument experimental musical instrument music instrument technology orchestra
