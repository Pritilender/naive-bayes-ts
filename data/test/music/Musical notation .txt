introduced consisting originally single horizontal but this was progressively extended until system four horizontal lines was this traditionally attributed guido arezzo who set out his thoughts the changes his first musical micrologus the vertical positions each mark the staff indicated which pitch pitches pitches were derived from musical mode although the line staff has remained use until the

most these cipher notations are mainly used notate the skeletal melody the balungan and vocal parts gerongan although transcriptions the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and drum parts are notated with system symbols largely based letters representing the vocables used learn and remember drumming these symbols are typically laid out grid underneath the skeletal melody for specific generic the symbols used for drum notation well the vocables are highly variable from place place and performer addition these current two older notations used kind the solonese script could capture the flexible rhythms the pesinden with squiggle horizontal while yogyakarta like vertical staff allowed notation the balungan dots and also included important drum there are few books published gamelan gender wayang pieces employing alphabetical notation the old balinese composers and scholars both indonesian and foreign have also mapped the slendro and pelog tuning systems gamelan onto the western with and without various symbols for microtones the dutch composer ton leeuw also invented three line staff for his composition gending however these systems not enjoy widespread the second half the twentieth indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation other oral and diatonic scale cipher notation has become common for notating related genres church popular and unlike the cipher notation for gamelan which uses fixed that always corresponds the same within the natural variability gamelan indonesian diatonic cipher notation notation scores must
