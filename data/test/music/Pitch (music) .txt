the sense associated with musical melodies which require sound whose frequency clear and stable enough distinguish from pitch major auditory attribute musical tones along with duration loudness and timbre pitch may quantified frequency but pitch not purely objective physical subjective psychoacoustical attribute historically the study pitch and pitch perception has been central problem and has been instrumental forming and testing theories sound processing and perception the auditory contents perception pitch pitch and frequency theories pitch perception just noticeable difference aural illusions definite and indefinite pitch concert pitch labeling pitches scales other musical meanings pitch see also references further reading external links perception pitch pitch and frequency pitch auditory sensation which listener assigns musical tones relative positions musical scale based primarily the frequency pitch closely related but the two are not frequency scientific whereas pitch sound waves themselves not have and their oscillations can measured obtain takes human mind map the internal quality pitches are usually quantified frequencies cycles per comparing sounds with pure tones which have periodic sinusoidal waveforms complex and aperiodic sound waves can often assigned pitch this according the american national standards institute pitch the auditory attribute sound according which sounds can ordered scale from low since pitch such close proxy for almost entirely determined how quickly the sound wave making the air vibrate and has almost nothing with the amplitude the that high pitch means very rapid and low pitch corresponds slower despite the idiom relating vertical height sound pitch shared most least just one many deep conceptual metaphors that involve the exact etymological history the musical sense high and low pitch still there evidence that humans actually perceive that the source sound slightly higher lower vertical space when the sound frequency increased most the pitch complex sounds such speech and musical notes corresponds very nearly the repetition rate periodic periodic the reciprocal the time interval between repeating similar events the sound the pitch complex tones can meaning that two more different pitches can depending upon the when the actual fundamental frequency can precisely determined through physical may differ from the perceived pitch because overtones also known upper harmonic complex tone composed two sine waves and may sometimes heard three two spectral pitches and derived from the physical frequencies the pure and the combination tone corresponding the repetition rate the situation like the percept commonly referred the missing fundamental which often the greatest common divisor the frequencies pitch depends lesser degree the sound pressure level volume the especially frequencies below and above the pitch lower tones gets lower sound pressure for tone that very loud seems one semitone lower pitch than just barely above the pitch gets higher the sound gets theories pitch perception theories pitch perception try explain how the physical sound and specific physiology the auditory system work together yield the experience pitch perception theories can divided into place coding and temporal coding place theory holds that the perception pitch determined the place maximum excitation the basilar membrane place taking advantage the tonotopy the auditory must effect for the perception high since neurons have upper limit how fast they can lock their action potentials however purely based theory cannot account for the accuracy pitch perception the low and middle frequency temporal theories offer alternative that appeals the temporal structure action mostly the phase locking and mode locking action potentials frequencies the precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch higher levels still but the processing seems based autocorrelation action potentials the auditory however has long been noted that neural mechanism that may accomplish necessary operation true has not been least one model shows that temporal delay unnecessary produce autocorrelation model pitch appealing phase shifts between cochlear filters however earlier work has shown that certain sounds with prominent peak their autocorrelation function not elicit corresponding pitch and that certain sounds without peak their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit more complete autocorrelation must therefore apply signals that represent the output the via nerve interval some theories pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities and therefore best decomposed into pitch chroma periodic value around the like the note names western and pitch height which may indicating which octave the pitch may just noticeable difference the just noticeable difference the threshold which change depends the frequency below the jnd about for sine and for complex above the jnd for sine waves about about cents the jnd typically tested playing two tones quick succession with the listener asked there was difference their the jnd becomes smaller the two tones are played simultaneously the listener then able discern beat frequencies the total number perceptible pitch steps the range human hearing about the total number notes the tempered from aural illusions the relative perception pitch can resulting aural illusions there are several such the tritone paradox but most notably the shepard scale where continuous discrete sequence specially formed tones can made sound the sequence continues ascending descending definite and indefinite pitch not all musical instruments make notes with clear the unpitched percussion instrument class percussion instrument not produce particular sound note definite pitch one where listener can possibly relatively discern the sounds with definite pitch have harmonic frequency spectra close harmonic sound generated any instrument produces many modes vibration that occur listener hears numerous frequencies the vibration with the lowest frequency called the fundamental frequency the other frequencies are overtones harmonics are important class overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples the whether not the higher frequencies are integer they are collectively called the partials referring the different parts that make the total sound note indefinite pitch one that listener finds impossible relatively difficult identify sounds with indefinite pitch not have harmonic spectra have altered harmonic spectra characteristic known inharmonicity still possible for two sounds indefinite pitch clearly higher lower than one for snare drum sounds higher pitched than bass drum though both have indefinite because its sound contains higher other possible and often easy roughly discern the relative pitches two sounds indefinite but sounds indefinite pitch not neatly correspond any specific special type pitch often occurs free nature when sound reaches the ear observer directly from the and also after reflecting reflecting this phenomenon called repetition pitch because the addition true repetition
