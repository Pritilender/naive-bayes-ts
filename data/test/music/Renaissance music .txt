from this changing society emerged unifying musical particular the polyphonic style the franco flemish school the development printing made distribution music possible wide demand for music entertainment and activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence bourgeois dissemination chansons motets and masses throughout europe coincided with the unification polyphonic practice into the fluid style which culminated the second half the sixteenth century the work composers such palestrina lassus victoria and william byrd relative political stability and prosperity the low

overview one the most pronounced features early renaissance european art music was the increasing reliance the interval the third the middle ages thirds had been considered polyphony became increasingly elaborate throughout the with highly independent the beginning the century showed with the voices often striving for this was possible because greatly increased vocal range the middle the narrow range made necessary frequent crossing thus requiring greater contrast between the modal opposed tonal characteristics renaissance music began break down towards the end the period with the increased use root motions this later developed into one the defining characteristics the main characteristics renaissance music music based richer texture four more blending rather than contrasting strands the musical harmony with greater concern with the flow and progression polyphony one the notable changes that mark the renaissance from the middle ages its use encouraged the use larger ensembles and demanded sets instruments that would blend together across the whole vocal genres principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire renaissance period were masses and with some other developments towards the especially composers sacred music began adopt secular forms such the madrigal for their own common sacred genres were the mass the motet the madrigale spirituale and the laude during the secular music had increasing with wide variety but one must cautious about assuming explosion since printing made music more widely much more has survived from this era than from the preceding medieval and probably rich store popular music the late middle ages irretrievably secular music included songs for one many forms such the frottola chanson and madrigal secular music was music that was independent the main type was the german italian the french the italian and the spanish secular vocal genres included the madrigal the frottola the caccia the chanson several forms rondeau virelai bergerette ballade musique the canzonetta the villancico the villanella the villotta and the lute song mixed forms such the motet chanson and the secular motet also purely instrumental music included consort music for recorder viol and other and dances for various common genres were the toccata the prelude the ricercar the canzona and intabulation intavolatura

and the intermedio are theory and notation according margaret bent renaissance notation prescriptive our when translated into modern form acquires prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original renaissance compositions were notated only individual scores were extremely and barlines were not note values were generally larger than are use the primary unit beat was the semibreve whole note had been the case since the ars nova see medieval music there could either two three these for each breve whole which may looked equivalent the modern though was itself note value and measure the situation can considered this the same the rule which modern music note may equal either two notes which would written the same there could two three the next smallest the equivalent the modern half each these different permutations were called imperfect the level the semibreve imperfect the level the and existed all possible combinations with each three one was called and one rules existed also whereby single notes could halved doubled value imperfected respectively when preceded followed other certain notes with black noteheads such quarter notes occurred less this development white mensural notation may result the increased use paper rather than vellum the weaker paper was less able withstand the scratching required fill solid notation previous written had been other and filled were used routinely mainly enforce the aforementioned imperfections alterations and call for other temporary rhythmical accidentals were not always somewhat certain fingering notations tablatures today however renaissance musicians would have been highly trained dyadic counterpoint and thus possessed this and other information necessary read what modern notation requires would then have been perfectly apparent without notation singer versed see musica ficta singer would interpret his her part figuring cadential formulas with other parts and when singing together musicians would avoid parallel octaves and fifths alter their cadential parts light decisions other musicians through contemporary tablatures for various plucked instruments that have gained much information about what accidentals were performed the original for information specific see johannes tinctoris franchinus gaffurius heinrich glarean pietro aron nicola vicentino tom santa gioseffo zarlino vicente lusitano vincenzo galilei giovanni artusi johannes nucius and pietro cerone composers the timeline early renaissance music this group gradually dropped the late medieval complex devices isorhythm and extreme syncopation resulting more limpid and flowing what their music lost rhythmic however gained rhythmic drive the became prominent feature around middle renaissance music woodcut the early music started printed using printing press music printing had major effect how music spread for not only did printed piece music reach larger audience than any manuscript ever did far more cheaply also during this tradition famous makers began for many these makers were masters their example neuschel for his towards the end the polyphonic sacred music exemplified the masses johannes ockeghem and jacob obrecht had once again become more manner that can perhaps seen correlating the stunning detail the painting the ockeghem particularly was fond canon both contrapuntal and mensural composed missa prolationum which all the parts are derived canonically from one musical was the opening decades the next century that music felt tactus think the modern time two breve began common that with three had prevailed prior that the early there another trend towards can seen some degree the work josquin des prez and his contemporaries the franco flemish school then later that palestrina who was partially reacting the strictures the council trent which discouraged excessively complex polyphony inhibiting understanding the early century flemings moved away from the complex systems canonic and other mensural play tending toward points imitation and duet trio sections within overall texture that grew five and six they also even before the tridentine insert lengthening passages homophony underline important text points palestrina the other came cultivate freely flowing style counterpoint rich texture within which consonance followed dissonance nearly beat and suspensions ruled the day see counterpoint tactus was generally two semibreves per breve with three per breve used for special effects and climactic this was nearly exact reversal the prevailing technique century late renaissance music venice from about until around impressive polychoral style which gave europe some the most sonorous music composed until that with multiple choirs brass and strings different spatial locations the basilica san marco venezia see venetian school these multiple revolutions spread over europe the next several beginning germany and then moving france and england somewhat demarcating the beginning what now know the baroque musical the roman school was group composers predominantly church music spanning the late renaissance and early baroque many the composers had direct connection the vatican and the papal though they worked several stylistically they are often contrasted with the venetian school concurrent movement which was much more far the most famous composer the roman school giovanni pierluigi while best known prolific composer masses and was also important his ability bring together the functional needs the catholic church with the prevailing musical styles during the counter reformation period gave him his enduring the brief but intense flowering the musical madrigal mostly from along with the composers who produced known the english madrigal school the english madrigals were predominantly light and generally began either copies direct translations italian most were for three six musica reservata either style performance practice cappella vocal music the mainly italy and southern involving exclusivity and intense emotional expression sung the cultivation european music the americas began the century soon after the arrival the and the conquest mexico although fashioned european uniquely mexican hybrid works based native mexican language and european musical appeared very musical practices new spain continually coincided with european tendencies throughout the subsequent baroque and classical music among these new world composers were hernando franco antonio salazar and manuel zumaya many composers observed division their own works between prima pratica music the renaissance polyphonic and seconda pratica music the new during the first part the masses the and century masses had two kinds sources that were monophonic and with two main forms based cantus firmus practice beginning some time around the new style pervasive four types masses cantus firmus mass tenor the cantus imitation mass the paraphrase mass the imitation mass parody masses were normally titled the source from which they cantus firmus mass uses the same monophonic usually drawn from chant and usually the tenor and most often longer note values than the other mannerism the late the renaissance era extremely manneristic style secular especially the there was trend towards complexity and even extreme chromaticism exemplified madrigals luzzaschi marenzio and gesualdo the term mannerism derives from art transition the baroque beginning florence there was attempt revive the dramatic and musical forms ancient through the means monody form declaimed music over simple more extreme contrast with the preceding polyphonic style would hard this was least the secular these musicians were known the florentine camerata have already noted some the musical developments that helped usher the baroque but for further explanation this see antiphon concertato monody madrigal and opera well the works given under sources and further for more thorough discussion the transition the baroque specifically pertaining instrument see transition from renaissance baroque instrumental music instruments many instruments originated during the others were variations improvements instruments that had existed some have survived the present others have only recreated order perform music the period authentic the modern instruments may classified strings percussion and medieval instruments europe had most commonly been used often self accompanied with occasionally during the century there was division instruments into haut outdoor and bas more intimate only two groups instruments could play freely both types the cornett and sackbut and the tabor and the beginning the instruments were considered less important than they were used for dances and accompany vocal instrumental music remained subordinated vocal and much its repertory was varying ways derived from dependent vocal brass brass instruments the renaissance were traditionally played some the more common brass instruments that were slide trumpet similar the trombone today except that instead section the body only small part the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself also the body was shape was rather but was suitable for the slow dance music which was most commonly used cornett made wood and was played like the recorder will mentioned greater length later but blown like was commonly made several the largest was called the the serpent became practically the only cornetto used the early century while other ranges were replaced the was said the closest instrument the human voice with the ability use dynamics and trumpet early trumpets had and were limited the tones present the overtone series they were also made different although commonly depicted being used their use churches was prominent exception being the music the venetian school they were most commonly used the military and for the announcement period trumpets were found have two rings soldered one near the mouthpiece and another near the sackbut sometimes sackbutt different name for the which replaced the slide trumpet the middle the strings family strings were used many both sacred and few members this family viol this developed the commonly has six was usually played with has structural qualities similar the spanish vihuela its main separating trait its larger this changed the posture the musician order rest against the floor between the legs manner similar the its similarities the vihuela were sharp similar flat thin and identical lyre its construction similar small although instead being strummed with its strings varied quantity from seven and depending the was played with the right while the left hand silenced the notes that were not newer lyres were modified played with irish harp also called the rsach scottish the irseach during the middle ages was the most popular instrument ireland and due its significance irish history seen even the guinness label and national symbol even this played usually its size can vary greatly from harp that can played lap size harp that placed the floor hurdy gurdy also known the wheel which the strings are sounded wheel which the strings pass its functionality can compared that mechanical that its bow turned its distinctive sound mainly because its drone which provide constant pitch similar their sound that see main cittern see main lute see main harpsichord see main virginal percussion some renaissance percussion instruments include the the the the the and various kinds tambourine the early ages the tambourine was originally frame drum without the jingles attached the this instrument soon evolved and took the name the timbrel during the medieval which time acquired the the tambourine was often found with single made easy for dancer the skin that surrounds the frame called the and produces the beat striking the surface with the fingertips could also played shaking the allowing the jingles clank and jingle jew harp instrument often known for its historical purpose for men serenading their citation needed even went the extent being repeatedly banned for its endangerment female citation needed also believed that was banned because its construction and due the great demand silver the century austria this was another reason for its steel instrument that produces sound using shapes the mouth and attempting pronounce different vowels with ones the loop the bent end the tongue the instrument plucked different scales vibration creating different woodwinds the woodwind instruments produce sound means vibrating column air within the holes along the pipe allow the player control the length the column and hence the there are several ways making the air column and these ways define the subcategories woodwind player may blow across mouth into mouthpiece with single day clarinet double oboe all three these methods tone production can found renaissance shawm typical oriental shawm keyless and about foot long with seven finger holes and thumb the pipes were also most commonly made wood and many them had carvings and decorations was the most popular double reed instrument the renaissance was commonly used the streets with drums and trumpets because its piercing and often deafening play the shawm person puts the entire reed their puffs out their and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their reed pipe made from single short length cane with four five finger and reed fashioned from the reed made cutting out small but leaving the base the predecessor the saxophone and the hornpipe same reed pipe but with bell the bagpipe believe have been invented herdsmen who thought use bag made out sheep goat skin and would provide air pressure that when its player takes the player only needs squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm continue the the mouth pipe has simple round piece leather hinged the bag end the pipe and acts like return the reed located inside the long metal known panpipe designed have sixteen wooden tubes with stopper one end and open the each tube different size thereby producing different giving range octave and the player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across transverse flute the transverse flute similar the modern flute with mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the the player blows the side and holds the flute the right recorder the recorder common instrument still used often taught children elementary rather than reed uses whistler mouth which beak shaped mouth its main source sound usually made with seven finger holes and thumb conclusion the century and early century saw the continual improvement many types woodwind instrument bores were redesigned extend their range and improve their tone viols and violins were provided with sound posts enhance their the compass keyboard instruments was widened and new tuning systems were the renaissance its
