common practice period part all musical work including melody and harmony built using the notes single which can conveniently represented staff with standard key signature due the principle octave equivalence scales are generally considered span single with higher lower octaves simply repeating the musical scale represents division the octave space into certain number scale scale step being the recognizable distance interval between two successive notes the measure the width each scale step provides method classify for chromatic scale each scale step represents semitone interval while major scale defined the interval pattern where stands for whole tone interval spanning two and stands for based their interval scales are divided into categories including diatonic chromatic major minor and specific scale defined its characteristic interval pattern and special known its first degree tonic the tonic scale the note selected the beginning the and therefore the beginning the adopted interval

scales steps and intervals chromatic circle scales are typically listed from low most scales are octave repeating meaning their pattern notes the same every octave the bohlen pierce scale one repeating scale can represented circular arrangement pitch ordered increasing pitch for the increasing major scale with the bracket indicating that the last note octave higher than the first and the decreasing major scale with the bracket indicating octave lower than the first note the the distance between two successive notes scale called scale step the notes scale are numbered their steps from

modern classical music heptatonic notes per the most common modern western scale hexatonic notes per common western folk music pentatonic notes per common folk especially oriental also known the black scale tetratonic notes tritonic notes and ditonic notes generally limited prehistoric primitive music monotonic note limited use and for effect modern art music citation needed the number the notes that make scale well the quality the intervals between successive notes the scale help give the music culture area its peculiar sound the pitch distances intervals among the notes scale tell more about the sound the music than does the mere number harmonic content the notes scale form intervals with each the other notes the chord combination note scale has these harmonic intervals note scale has note scale has note chord has though the scale not chord and might never heard more than one note still the presence and placement certain key intervals plays large part the sound the the natural movement melody within the and the selection chords taken naturally from the musical scale containing tritones called one without tritones scale chord containing semitones called one without semitones anhemitonic the significance these categories lies their bases semitones and tritones being the severest dissonances avoidance which often the most used scales across the planet are scales composition play help info play help info play help info scales can abstracted from performance composition they are also often used precompositionally guide limit explicit instruction scales has been part compositional training for many one more scales may used such claude debussy isle joyeuse the the first scale whole tone while the second and third scales are diatonic all three are used the opening pages western music musical mode scales traditional western music generally consist seven notes and repeat the notes the commonly used scales see just are separated whole and half step intervals tones and semitones the harmonic minor scale includes semitone the pentatonic includes two western music the medieval and renaissance periods tends use the note diatonic scale accidentals are and somewhat unsystematically often avoid the tritone music the common practice periods uses three types the diatonic scale seven this includes the major scale and the natural minor the melodic and harmonic minor scales seven these scales are used all their the music this period introduces modulation which involves systematic changes from one scale modulation occurs relatively conventionalized for major mode pieces typically begin tonic diatonic scale and modulate the dominant scale fifth the century certain but more the additional types scales were the chromatic scale twelve the whole tone scale six the pentatonic scale five the octatonic diminished scales eight large variety other scales some the more common the phrygian dominant scales mode the harmonic minor the arabic scales the hungarian minor scale the byzantine music scales called the persian scale scales such the pentatonic scale may considered gapped relative the diatonic auxiliary scale scale other than the primary original see modulation and auxiliary diminished scale naming the notes scale many musical specific note the scale will chosen the tonic the central and most stable note the also known the root relative choice the notes scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they for the notes the major scale can labeled reflecting the choice the expression scale degree refers these numerical such labeling requires the choice first note hence degree labels are not intrinsic the scale but rather its for choose then can label the notes the major scale using and when create new scale called the minor scale see the note article for how the notes are customarily named different the scale degrees heptatonic scale can also named using the terms tonic supertonic mediant subdominant dominant submediant subtonic the subtonic semitone away from the then usually called the leading tone otherwise the tone refers the raised also commonly used the movable solf naming convention which each scale degree denoted the major the solfege syllables naming the notes customary that each scale degree assigned its own letter for the major scale written rather than however impossible this with scales containing more than seven scales may also identified using binary system twelve zeros ones represent each the twelve notes chromatic scale assumed that the scale tuned using tone equal temperament for the same and that the tonic the leftmost for example the binary number equivalent the decimal number would represent any major scale such this system includes scales from providing total possible species but only unique scales containing from notes scales may also shown semitones fret from the for denotes any major scale such which the first degree obviously semitones from the tonic and therefore coincides with the second semitones from the the third semitones from the and again this implies that the notes are drawn from chromatic scale tuned with tone equal scalar transposition composers often transform musical patterns moving every note the pattern constant number scale thus the major scale the pattern might shifted transposed single scale step become this process called scalar and can often found musical sequences since the steps scale can have various this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the this variation what gives scalar music much its jazz and blues jazz scales through the introduction blue notes jazz and blues employ scale intervals smaller than the blue note interval that technically neither major nor minor but the giving characteristic for the key the blue note would either note between and note moving between blues pentatonic scale often jazz many different modes and scales are often within the same piece chromatic scales are especially modern non western scales western scale notes are often separated equally tempered tones creating pitches per many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals different number these scales originate within the derivation the harmonic series musical intervals are complementary values the harmonic overtones series many musical scales the world are based this except most the musical scales from indonesia and the indochina peninsulae which are based inharmonic resonance the dominant metalophone and xylophone common scale eastern music the pentatonic consisting five the middle eastern hejaz scale there are some intervals three gamelan music uses small variety scales including log and ndro none including equally tempered nor harmonic indian classical music uses moveable seven note scale indian gas often use intervals smaller than arabic music maqamat may use quarter tone intervals both gas and the distance between note and inflection ruti that same note may less than microtonal scales this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed june the term microtonal music usually refers music with roots traditional western music that uses standard scales scale mexican composer juli carrillo created the late century microtonal scales which called sonido the composer harry partch made custom musical instruments play compositions that employed note scale system and the american jazz vibraphonist emil richards experimented with such scales his microtonal blues band the easley blackwood has written compositions all tempered scales from notes erv wilson introduced concepts such combination product sets hexany moments symmetry and golden used many modern weasel words microtonal scales are also used traditional indian raga music which has variety modes which are used not only
