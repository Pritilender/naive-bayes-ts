argument navigation search argument logic and philosophy argument attempt persuade someone giving reasons for accepting particular conclusion the general form argument natural language that premises typically the form propositions statements sentences support the the structure some arguments can also set out formal language and formally defined arguments can made independently natural language logic and computer typical deductive argument the premises are meant provide guarantee the truth the while inductive argument they are thought provide reasons supporting the probable truth the standards for evaluating deductive arguments may rest different additional criteria than for the persuasiveness called indispensability transcendental arguments the quality hypotheses retroduction even the disclosure new possibilities for thinking and the standards and criteria used evaluating arguments and their forms reasoning are studied ways formulating arguments effectively are studied rhetoric see argumentation theory argument formal language shows the logical form the symbolically represented natural language arguments obtained its interpretations contents formal and informal arguments standard argument types deductive arguments validity soundness inductive arguments defeasible arguments argument analogy transitional arguments other kinds arguments argument informal logic logical status argument world disclosing arguments explanations and arguments fallacies and nonarguments see also notes references further reading external links formal and informal arguments informal logic formal logic informal arguments studied informal logic are presented ordinary language and are intended for everyday discourse conversely formal arguments are studied formal logic historically called symbolic logic more commonly referred mathematical logic today and are expressed formal language informal logic may said emphasize the study argumentation whereas formal logic emphasizes implication and inference informal arguments are sometimes that the rational the relationship premises warrants relations and not always spelled out and immediately visible and must sometimes made explicit standard argument types there are several kinds arguments the known which are deductive and deductive arguments are sometimes referred arguments because the truth the conclusion follows given that the deductive argument asserts that the truth the conclusion logical consequence the inductive argument the other asserts that the truth the conclusion otherwise supported the each premise and the conclusion are truth bearers capable being either true false and not while statements argument are referred being either true false arguments are referred being valid invalid see logical truth deductive argument valid and only the truth the conclusion entailed logical consequence the and its corresponding conditional therefore logical sound argument valid argument with true valid argument may well have false premises under given however the truth value conclusion cannot determined unsound deductive arguments deductive argument deductive argument one has conclusion that entailed its other the truth the conclusion logical consequence the the premises are then the conclusion must would contradictory assert the premises and deny the because the negation the conclusion contradictory the truth the validity validity deductive arguments may either valid argument valid and its premises are the conclusion must valid argument cannot have true premises and false argument formally valid and only the denial the conclusion incompatible with accepting all the the validity argument however not the actual truth falsity its premises and but solely whether not the argument has valid logical form the validity argument not guarantee the truth its under given valid argument may have false premises that render the conclusion valid argument with one more false premises may either true logic seeks discover the valid the forms that make arguments form argument valid and only the conclusion true under all interpretations that argument which the premises are since the validity argument depends solely its argument can shown invalid showing that its form this can done giving counter example the same form argument with premises that are true under given but conclusion that false under that informal logic this called counter argument the form argument can shown the use for each argument there corresponding statement called corresponding conditional and argument form valid and only its corresponding conditional logical truth statement form which logically true also said valid statement statement form logical truth true under all interpretations statement form can shown logical truth either showing that tautology means proof procedure the corresponding conditional valid argument necessary truth true all possible worlds and the conclusion necessarily follows from the follows logical the conclusion valid argument not necessarily depends whether the premises are the itself just happens necessary without regard the for some greeks are therefore some logicians are some greeks are logicians some logicians are greeks all greeks are human and all humans are therefore all greeks are some greeks are logicians and some logicians are therefore some greeks are either are all doomed are all are not all therefore are all premise some men are premise some hawkers are conclusion some men are this argument there way where you can determine whether argument give example with the same argument counter premise some people are premise some herbivores are conclusion some people are this obviously the example follows the same logical form the previous premise some are premise some are conclusion some are order demonstrate that whatever hawkers may they may may not consideration the premises see existential import the forms argument that render deductions valid are however invalid arguments can also inductive arguments for see formal fallacy and informal fallacy soundness soundness sound argument valid argument whose conclusion follows from its and the the argument are inductive arguments inductive argument deductive logic reasoning using arguments which the premises support the conclusion but not entail forms deductive logic include the statistical syllogism which argues from generalizations true for the most and induction form reasoning that makes generalizations based individual inductive argument said cogent and only the truth the premises would render the truth the conclusion probable the argument strong and the premises true cogency can considered inductive logic analogue deductive logic soundness despite its mathematical induction not form inductive the lack deductive validity known the problem induction defeasible arguments argument defeasible when additional information such new can have the effect that longer justifies its the term defeasibility goes back the legal theorist hart although focused concepts instead stephen toulmin influential argument model includes the possibility counterreasons that are characteristic defeasible but did not discuss the evaluation defeasible defeasible arguments give rise defeasible reasoning argument analogy argument analogy may thought argument from the particular argument analogy may use particular truth premise argue towards similar particular truth the for plato was and socrates was like plato other then asserting that socrates was mortal example argument analogy because the reasoning employed proceeds from particular truth premise plato was similar particular truth the namely that socrates was transitional arguments epistemology transitional arguments attempt show that particular explanation better than another because able make sense transition from old that explanation can account for the problems that existed with explanation but not vice then regarded the more reasonable common example the history science the transition from galilean galilean understandings physical motion other kinds arguments other kinds arguments may have different additional standards validity for charles taylor writes that called transcendental arguments are made chain indispensability that attempt show why something necessarily true based its connection our while nikolas kompridis has suggested that there are two types fallible arguments one based truth and the other based the responsive disclosure possibility see world disclosure the late french philosopher michel foucault said have been prominent advocate this latter form philosophical argument informal logic argument informal relating effort performed sum possible future either economic informal argument connexion between individual action through which generally accepted good you should marry jane individual individual you should not smoke individual individual the argument neither advice nor moral economical judgement but the connection between the argument always uses the connective because argument not explanation does not connect two cause and which already took but possible individual action and its beneficial argument not proof proof logical and cognitive argument praxeologic proof changes our argument compels citation needed logical status argument argument does not belong because connected real real and real effort john will buy this will become twice valuable mary study you will become famous ballet the value the argument connected the immediate circumstances the person spoken the first john has will die the next will not interested buying the the second case she too too she will not interested studying and becoming the argument not but world disclosing arguments world disclosure disclosing arguments are group philosophical arguments that are said employ disclosive approach reveal features wider ontological linguistic understanding specifically ontological sense order clarify transform the background meaning and logical which argument implicitly explanations and arguments explanation while arguments attempt show that something will should the explanations try show why how something will fred and joe address the issue whether not cat has joe may your cat has observe the cat scratching right joe has made argument that the cat has however joe asks why your cat scratching the because has provides both the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that fleas often cause and that one often scratches relieve the difference the argument attempts settle whether not some claim and explanation attempts provide understanding the note that subsuming the specific event cat instance the general rule that animals scratch themselves when they have joe will longer wonder why fred cat scratching arguments address problems explanations address problems also note that the argument the cat has for debate but the the cat has assumed true unquestioned this and just needs explaining arguments and explanations largely resemble each other rhetorical use this the cause much difficulty thinking critically about there are several reasons for this people often are not themselves clear whether they are arguing for explaining the same types words and phrases are used presenting explanations and the terms cetera are frequently used explanations are often used within arguments and presented serve arguments likewise arguments are essential the process justifying the validity any explanation there are often multiple explanations for any given explanations and arguments are often studied the field information systems help explain user acceptance based certain argument types may fit better with personality traits enhance acceptance fallacies and nonarguments formal fallacy fallacies are types argument expressions which are held invalid form contain errors there not yet any general theory fallacy strong agreement among researchers their definition potential for application but the term broadly applicable label certain examples and also variously applied ambiguous logic types fallacy are firmly described first the premises and the conclusion must capable being true secondly must asserted that the conclusion follows from the english the words therefore because and hence typically separate the premises from the conclusion but this not necessarily thus socrates all men are mortal therefore socrates mortal clearly argument valid one because clear asserted that socrates mortal follows from the preceding however was thirsty and therefore drank not despite its not being claimed that drank logically entailed was thirsty the therefore this sentence indicates for that reason not follows that often argument invalid because there missing the supply which would render speakers and writers will often leave out strictly necessary premise their reasonings widely accepted and the writer does not wish state the blindingly example all metals expand when therefore iron will expand when missing iron the other seemingly valid argument may found lack premise hidden which highlighted can show fault example witness nobody came out the front door except the therefore the murderer must have left the back hidden the milkman was not the and the murderer has left the front back see also logic portal
