simply does not emptiness another closely related explanation that reality devoid sensory mediation and and therefore language itself priori inadequate without direct thus the silence does not indicate misology disdain for rather indicates that viewed the answers these questions not understandable the dependent arising provides framework for analysis reality that not based metaphysical assumptions regarding existence but instead imagining direct cognition phenomena they are presented the this informs and supports the buddhist approach liberation from adventitious distortion and

according these there was something they variously call earliest buddhism original canonical some scholars and have proposed other according some the philosophical outlook earliest buddhism was primarily the sense that focused what doctrines reject more than what doctrines accept only knowledge that useful achieving enlightenment according this the cycle philosophical upheavals that part drove the diversification buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once buddhists began attempting make explicit the implicit philosophy the buddha and the early other scholars reject this after the death the attempts were made gather his teachings and transmit them commonly agreed first then also writing the tripi aka dukkha dukkha often translated suffering the inherent unsatisfactoriness this unsatisfactoriness drives our yearning for better way yet keeps imprisoned wordly existence and rebirth dependent origination dependent origination the working the rising and ceasing suffering explained pratitya samutpada dependent origination states that events are not predetermined nor are they random rejects notions direct which are necessarily undergirded

justification all schools indian logic recognize various sets valid justifications for pram buddhism recognizes set that smaller than the for some schools hinduism and buddhism the received textual tradition epistemological category equal perception and inference although this not necessarily true for some other thus the hindu claim was made that could not substantiated appeal the textual would considered ridiculous claim that the sky was green conversely claim which could not substantiated via conventional means might still justified through textual differentiating this from the epistemology modern science must also remembered that most hindu schools believe that logical inference and perception the sense organs the most effective means testing the nyaya school hinduism one which highly believes application logic and reason more than canonical citation needed early buddhist schools the main early buddhist philosophical schools are the abhidharma schools particularly sarv and therav sarvastivadin realism early buddhist philosophers and exegetes the sarv dins created pluralist metaphysical and phenomenological which all experiences things and events can broken down into smaller and smaller perceptual ontological units called dharmas other schools incorporated some parts this theory and criticized the sautr ntikas another early and the therav dins now the only modern survivor the early buddhist criticized the realist standpoint the theravada theravada promotes the concept vibhajjavada literally teaching this doctrine says that insight must come from the critical and reasoning instead blind the buddha said according the canonical not accept anything mere tradition not accept anything just because accords with your scriptures not accept anything merely because agrees with your conceived notions but when you know for these things are these things are these things are praised the these when performed and conduce being and then you live acting mahayana mahayana often adopts pragmatic concept truth doctrines are regarded conditionally true the sense being spiritually modern chinese buddhism all doctrinal traditions are regarded equally main mahayana

idiosyncratic these the true described the perfection the wisdom not self the buddha nature treatise for language that had previously been used essentialist buddhist philosophers was now with new buddhists promote orthodox the tath gatagarbha does according some represent substantial rather positive language expression emptiness and represents the potentiality realize buddhahood through buddhist this the intention the teaching tath gatagarbha soteriological rather than the tath gathagarbha the therav doctrine bhava and the yog store consciousness were all identified some point with
