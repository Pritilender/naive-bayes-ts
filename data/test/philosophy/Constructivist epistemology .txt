called replied that took pride sydney brenner criticisms numerous criticisms have been leveled constructivist the most common one that either explicitly advocates implicitly reduces relativism this because takes the concept truth socially constructed and thereby socially one this leads the charge self refutation what regarded true relative particular social then this very conception truth must itself only regarded being true this another social may well then social constructivism itself would false that social further one could then say that social constructivism could both true and false another criticism constructivism that holds that the concepts two different social formations entirely different and this being the impossible make comparative judgements about statements made according each this because the criteria judgement will themselves have based some worldview this the then brings into question how communication between them about the truth falsity any given statement could social constructivists often argue that constructivism liberating because either enables oppressed groups reconstruct the accordance with their own interests rather than according the interests dominant groups compels people respect the alternative worldviews oppressed groups because there way judging them inferior dominant the wittgensteinian philosopher gavin kitching argues however constructivists usually implicitly presuppose deterministic view language which severely constrains the minds and use words members they are not just constructed language this but are literally determined kitching notes the contradiction somehow the advocate constructivism not similarly while other individuals are controlled the dominant concepts the advocate constructivism can transcend these concepts and see though see also constructivism international relations cultural marxism metacognition dependent realism personal construct psychology
