set views about the relationship between mind and and contrasted with other such physicalism the mind body problem aristotle shared plato view multiple souls psych and further elaborated hierarchical corresponding the distinctive functions animals and nutritive soul growth and that all three perceptive soul pleasure and that only people and other animals and the faculty that unique people this soul the hylomorphic form viable wherein each level the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance the preceding thus for all three souls perish when the living organism for plato the soul was not dependent the physical believed metempsychosis the migration the soul new physical dualism closely associated with the philosophy ren descartes which holds that the mind nonphysical descartes

ontological dualism makes dual commitments about the nature existence relates mind and and can divided into three different substance dualism asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds property dualism suggests that the ontological distinction lies the differences between properties mind and matter emergentism predicate dualism claims the irreducibility mental predicates physical cartesian dualism substance dualism type dualism most famously defended ren descartes which states that there are two fundamental kinds mental and according his which specifically called cartesian the mental does not have extension and the material cannot substance dualism important historically for having given rise much thought regarding the famous body substance dualism philosophical position compatible with most theologies which claim that immortal souls occupy independent realm existence distinct from that the physical property dualism property dualism property dualism asserts that ontological distinction lies the differences between properties mind and and that consciousness ontologically irreducible neurobiology and asserts that when matter organized the appropriate way the way that living human bodies are mental properties hence branch emergent materialism what views properly fall under the property dualism rubric itself matter there are different versions property some which claim independent non reductive physicalism form property dualism which asserted that all mental states are causally reducible physical one argument for this has been made the form anomalous monism expressed donald davidson where argued that mental events are identical physical and there can strict governed causal another argument for this has been expressed john searle who the advocate distinctive form physicalism calls biological naturalism his view that although mental states are ontologically irreducible physical they are causally reducible see causality has acknowledged that many his views and those property dualists look lot but thinks the comparison epiphenomenalism epiphenomenalism epiphenomenalism form property which asserted that one more mental states not have any influence physical states both ontologically and causally asserts that while material causes give rise sensations volitions ideas etc such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing they are causal this can contrasted interactionism the other which mental causes can produce material and predicate dualism predicate dualism view espoused nonreductive physicalists such donald davidson and jerry fodor who maintain that while there only one ontological category substances and properties substances usually the predicates that use describe mental events cannot redescribed terms reduced physical predicates natural characterize predicate monism the view subscribed eliminative materialists who maintain that such intentional predicates desire think feel etc will eventually eliminated from both the language science and from ordinary language because the entities which they refer not then predicate dualism most easily defined the negation this predicate dualists believe that called folk with all its propositional attitude ascriptions ineliminable part the enterprise explaining and understanding human mental states and davidson for subscribes anomalous monism according which there can strict physical laws which connect mental and physical events under their descriptions mental and physical events however all mental events also have physical terms the latter that such events can connected like relations with other physical mental predicates are irreducibly different character holistic and from physical predicates atomic and dualist views mental causation this part about causation between properties and states the thing under not its substances here state the set all properties being thus each state describes only one interactionism interactionism philosophy interactionism the view that mental such beliefs and causally interact with physical this position which very appealing sense notwithstanding the fact that very difficult establish its validity correctness way logical argumentation empirical seems appeal sense because are surrounded such everyday occurrences touching hot stove physical which causes him feel pain mental and then yell and scream physical which causes his parents experience sensation fear and protectiveness mental and non reductive physicalism non reductive physicalism reductive physicalism the idea that while mental states are physical they are not reducible physical that ontological distinction lies the differences between the properties mind and according reductive physicalism all mental states are causally reducible physical states where mental properties map physical properties and prominent form reductive physicalism called anomalous monism was first proposed donald davidson his paper mental events where claimed that mental events are identical with physical and that the mental under their mental descriptions these mental events are not regulated strict physical laws epiphenomenalism epiphenomenalism according epiphenomenalism all mental events are caused physical event and have physical and that one more mental states not have any influence physical the mental event deciding pick rock caused the firing specific neurons the brain when the arm and hand move pick the rock this not caused the preceding mental event nor and but only the physical causes are principle reducible fundamental and therefore mental causes are eliminated using this reductionist explanation causes both and there overdetermination the explanation for the idea that even the animal were conscious nothing would added the production even animals the human was first voiced mettrie and then cabanis and was further explicated hodgson and huxley jackson gave subjective argument for but later refuted and embraced physicalism parallelism parallelism psycho physical parallelism very unusual view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most and perhaps only truly advocated gottfried wilhelm von leibniz like malebranche and others before leibniz recognized the weaknesses account causal interaction taking place physical location the malebranche decided that such material basis interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine occasionalism stating that the interactions were really caused the intervention god each individual leibniz idea that god has created pre established harmony such that only seems physical and mental events and are caused one mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical hence the term parallelism used describe this occasionalism occasionalism occasionalism philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot efficient causes instead all events are taken caused directly god the theory states that the illusion efficient causation between mundane events arises out constant conjunction that god had such that every instance where the cause present will constitute occasion for the effect occur expression the aforementioned this occasioning relation however falls short efficient this not the case that the first event causes god cause the second rather god first caused one and then caused the but chose regulate such behaviour accordance with general laws some its most prominent historical exponents have been louis forge arnold geulincx and nicholas malebranche historical overview plato and aristotle the dialogue phaedo plato formulated his famous theory forms distinct and immaterial substances which the objects and other phenomena that perceive the world are nothing more than mere plato makes the phaedo that the forms are the universalia ante res they are ideal which are able understand the his allegory the cave plato likens the achievement philosophical understanding emerging into the sun from dark where only vague shadows what lies beyond that prison are cast dimly upon the plato forms are physical and they exist nowhere time but neither they exist the nor the pleroma rather matter said participate form methexis remained unclear even exactly what plato intended aristotle argued length against many aspects creating his own doctrine hylomorphism wherein form and matter ultimately aristotle aim was perfect theory rather than reject although aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence plato attributed his metaphysics agree with priori considerations quite for aristotle argues that eternal substantial form necessarily because matter provides stable substratum for change matter always has the potential thus given eternity which will necessarily exercise that part psychology the study the his account the ability humans reason and the ability animals both perfect copies forms are either direct impression environmental the case else virtue understanding and believed the mind can literally assume any form being contemplated and was unique its ability become blank having essential thoughts earth are not any more than thoughts fire are casually they provide immaterial complement for the formless from neoplatonism scholasticism the early middle there was resurgence what now called neoplatonism which generally based neoplatonism exerted considerable influence christianity did the philosophy aristotle via scholasticism the scholastic tradition saint thomas aquinas number whose doctrines have been incorporated into roman catholic dogma the soul the substantial form human aquinas held the quaestiones disputate anima disputed questions the the roman studium provinciale the dominican order santa sabina the forerunner the pontifical university saint thomas angelicum during the academic year aquinas had written least the first book the sententia libri anima aquinas commentary anima the translation which from the greek was completed dominican associate viterbo william moerbeke like aquinas held that the human being was unified composite substance two substantial form and the soul the substantial form and the first actuality material organic body with the potentiality for while aquinas defended the unity human nature composite substance constituted these two inextricable principles form and also argued for the incorruptibility the intellectual contrast the corruptibility the vegetative and sensitive animation plants and his argument for the subsistence and incorruptibility the intellectual soul takes its point departure from the metaphysical principle that operation follows upon being agiture sequitur esse the activity thing reveals the mode being and existence depends since the intellectual soul exercises its own per intellectual operations without employing material intellectual operations are the intellect itself and the intellectual must likewise immaterial and even though the intellectual soul man able subsist upon the death the human aquinas does not hold that the human person able remain integrated the separated intellectual soul neither man nor human the intellectual soul itself not human person individual supposit rational hence aquinas held that soul peter pray for would more appropriate than peter pray for because all things connected with his including ended with his corporeal the catholic doctrine the resurrection the body states that the second coming the souls the departed will reunited with their bodies whole person and witness the apocalypse the thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here part from serious attendance the principle that there can only one consistency with logic philosophy and faith remained high priority for and university doctorate theology generally included the entire science curriculum this doctrine not universally accepted christians many believe that immortal soul goes directly heaven upon death the descartes and his disciples his meditations first philosophy descartes embarked upon quest which called all his previous beliefs into order find out what could discovered that could doubt whether had body could that was dreaming that was illusion created evil but could not doubt whether had this gave descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different the according was thinking res cogitans and immaterial substance this thing was the essence that which believes hopes and the distinction between mind and body argued meditation have clear and distinct idea myself non extended and clear and distinct idea body extended and thinking whatever can conceive clearly and god can descartes the thinking can exist apart from its extended and the mind substance distinct from the substance whose essence the central claim what often called cartesian dualism honor that the immaterial mind and the material while being ontologically distinct causally this idea that continues feature prominently many european mental events cause physical and but this leads substantial problem for cartesian how can immaterial mind cause anything material and this has often been called the problem descartes himself struggled come with feasible answer this his letter elisabeth princess palatine suggested that animal spirits interacted with the body through the pineal gland small gland the centre the brain between the two hemispheres the term cartesian also often associated with this more specific notion causal interaction through the pineal however this explanation was not how can immaterial mind interact with the physical pineal because was such difficult theory some his such arnold geulincx and nicholas malebranche proposed different that all body interactions required the direct intervention god according these the appropriate states mind and body were only the occasions for such not real these occasionalists maintained the strong thesis that all causation was directly dependent instead holding that all causation was natural except for that between mind and arguments for dualism the subjective argument important fact that minds perceive intramental states differently from sensory and this cognitive difference results mental and physical phenomena having seemingly disparate the subjective argument holds that these properties are irreconcilable under physical mental events have certain subjective quality whereas physical seem not for one may ask what burned finger feels what the blueness the sky looks what nice music sounds philosophers mind call the subjective aspects mental events qualia raw feels there something that like feel see familiar shade and there are qualia involved these mental and the claim that qualia cannot reduced anything thomas nagel first characterized the problem qualia for physicalistic monism his what like nagel argued that even knew everything there was know from scientific perspective about sonar still know what like however others argue that qualia are consequent the same neurological processes that engender the and will fully understood the science develops frank jackson formulated his known knowledge argument based upon similar this thought experiment known mary room asks consider mary who was and has lived all her black and white room with black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can the nature jackson asserts that soon mary leaves the she will come have new knowledge which she did not possess the knowledge the experience colours what they are although mary knows everything there know about colours from third person she has never according what was like see orange mary really learns something must knowledge something since she already knew everything about the physical aspects however jackson later rejected his argument and embraced physicalism notes that mary obtains knowledge not but new intramental seeing color also notes that mary might say and mental state affecting the this clashed with his former view epiphenomenalism david lewis response this now known the ability argument that what mary really came know was simply the ability recognize and identify color sensations which she had previously not been daniel dennett and others also provide arguments against this notion see criticism special sciences argument robinson argues predicate dualism then there are special that are irreducible these allegedly irreducible which contain irreducible differ from hard sciences that they are here interest relative fields depend the existence minds that can have interested psychology one such completely depends and presupposes the existence the physics the general analysis nature conducted order understand how the universe behaves the other the study meteorological weather patterns human behavior only interest humans the point that having perspective the world psychological therefore the special sciences presuppose the existence minds which can have these one avoid ontological then the mind that has perspective must part the physical reality which applies its this the then order perceive the physical world the mind must have perspective the this presupposes the existence however cognitive science and psychology not require the mind and operate the assumption that has physical common science presuppose complex while fields such chemistry biology geology could verbosely expressed terms quantum field theory convenient use levels abstraction like molecules cells the mantle often difficult decompose these levels without heavy analysis and sober has also advanced philosophical arguments against the notion the zombie argument philosophical zombie the zombie argument based thought experiment proposed david the basic idea that one can and therefore conceive the existence apparently functioning human body without any conscious states being associated with chalmers argument that seems plausible that such being could exist because all that needed that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about human being must true the none the concepts involved these sciences make reference consciousness other mental and any physical entity can described scientifically via physics whether conscious the mere logical possibility zombie demonstrates that consciousness natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory chalmers states that one probably could not build living zombie because living things seem require level however robots built simulate humans may become the first real hence chalmers joking calls for the need build consciousness ascertain any given human conscious others such dennett have argued that the notion philosophical zombie concept nothing proves that entity computer which would perfectly mimic human and especially perfectly mimic expressions feelings like fear anger would not indeed experience thus having similar states consciousness what real human would argued that under physicalism one must either believe that anyone including oneself might that one can following from the assertion that own conviction about being not zombie product the physical world and therefore different from anyone argument from personal identity this argument concerns the differences between the applicability counterfactual conditionals physical the one and personal agents the the case any material can formulate series counterfactuals the following this printer could have been made this printer could have been made some other kind plastics and tube this printer could have been made what actually made and vacuum tube etc somewhere along the way from the being made exactly the parts and materials which actually constitute the being made some different matter say the question whether this printer the same printer becomes matter arbitrary imagine the case frederick who has counterpart born from the same egg and slightly genetically modified sperm imagine series counterfactual cases corresponding the examples applied the somewhere along the one longer sure about the identity this latter has been overlap constitution cannot applied the identity madell puts the counterpart frederickus constituted the same physical substance does this mean that also mentally identical with does make sense say that something mentally frederick possible solution this dilemma that open individualism argument from reason argument from reason philosophers and scientists such victor reppert william hasker and alvin plantinga have developed argument for dualism dubbed the argument from they credit lewis with first bringing the argument light his book miracles lewis called the argument the cardinal difficulty which was the title chapter three miracles the argument postulates that naturalism all our thoughts are the effect physical then have reason for assuming that they are also the consequent reasonable however knowledge apprehended reasoning from ground therefore naturalism were there would way knowing anything except through this the statement have reason believe naturalism inconsistent the same manner never tell the that conclude its truth would eliminate the grounds from which reach summarize the argument the lewis quotes haldane who appeals similar line mental processes are determined wholly the motions atoms have reason suppose that beliefs are true and hence have reason for supposing brain composed page his essay theology lewis himself summarises the argument similar fashion when minds are wholly dependent and brains and biochemistry the long the meaningless flux the cannot understand how the thought those minds should have any more significance than the sound the wind the the weight glory and other addresses page but lewis later agreed with elizabeth anscombe response his miracles argument she showed that argument could valid and consequent even its propositions were generated via physical cause and effect rational similar richard carrier and john beversluis have written extensive objections the argument from reason the untenability its first causal interaction consciousness the can exist independently physical reality the one must explain how physical memories are created concerning dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical the explanation given arnold geulincx and nicholas malebranche that occasionalism where all body interactions require the direct intervention the time lewis wrote miracles quantum mechanics and physical indeterminism was only the initial stages but still lewis stated the logical possibility the physical world was proved this would provide entry point into the traditionally viewed closed where scientifically described physically improbable event could philosophically described action physical entity physical however that none the arguments his book will rely should also noted while some interpretations quantum mechanics consider wave function collapse others this event defined and arguments against dualism causal interaction one argument against dualism with regard causal consciousness the can exist independently physical reality the one must explain how physical memories are created concerning dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical one the main objections dualistic interactionism lack explanation how the material and immaterial are able varieties dualism according which immaterial mind causally affects the material body and versa have come under strenuous attack from different especially the critics dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally this the basic problem causal interaction first not clear where the interaction would take for burning finger causes apparently there some chain leading from the burning the stimulation nerve something happening the peripheral nerves body that lead something happening particular part and finally resulting the sensation but pain not supposed spatially might responded that the pain takes place the but the pain the this may not devastating however there second problem about the namely the question how the interaction takes where dualism the assumed physical and definition outside the realm the mechanism which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore philosophical proposition compared scientific for compare such mechanism physical mechanism that well take very simple causal such when cue ball strikes eight ball and causes into the what happens this case that the cue ball has certain amount momentum its mass moves across the pool table with certain and then that momentum transferred the eight which then heads toward the compare this the situation the where one wants say that decision causes some neurons fire and thus causes body move across the the intention cross the room mental event does not have physical properties such has then would seem that could not possibly cause any neuron however with explanation required how something without any physical properties has physical effects argument from physics the argument from physics closely related the argument from causal many physicists and consciousness researchers have argued that any action nonphysical mind the brain would entail the violation physical such the conservation energy assuming deterministic physical the objection can formulated more when person decides walk across generally understood that the decision mental immediately causes group neurons that brain physical which ultimately results his walking across the the problem that there something totally nonphysical causing bunch neurons then there physical event which causes the this means that some physical energy required generated against the physical laws the deterministic this definition miracle and there can scientific explanation repeatable experiment performed where the physical energy for the firing came such interactions would violate the fundamental laws physics some external source energy responsible for the then this would violate the law the conservation energy dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against that violates general heuristic principle the causal closure the physical replies the argument from causal interaction and the argument from physics stanford encyclopedia philosophy and catholic encyclopedia give two possible replies these the first reply that the mind may influence the distribution without altering its but such influence still violates energy the second possibility deny that the human body causally the conservation energy applies only closed however physicalists object evidence exists for the causal closure the human another reply akin mills holds that behavioral events are causally overdetermined and can explained either physical mental causes overdetermined event fully accounted for multiple causes however smart and paul churchland have pointed out that physical phenomena fully determine behavioral then occam razor unphysical mind another reply this given that there possibility that the interaction may involve dark energy dark matter some other currently unknown scientific however such processes would necessarily and this case dualism replaced with the interaction point left for study later time when these physical processes are another reply that the interaction taking place the human body may not described billiard classical mechanics nondeterministic interpretation quantum mechanics correct then microscopic events are indeterminate where the degree determinism increases with the scale the system see quantum decoherence philosophers karl popper and john eccles and physicist henry stapp have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply the macroscopic however classical and quantum calculations show that quantum decoherence effects not play role brain indeed macroscopic quantum states have only ever been observed superconductors near absolute zero thomas breuer had proven that physical theories valid for the whole universe are any theory will wrong when applied system which contains the observer himself due dubious discuss this proves that the own body does not follow the same physical laws the rest the but other people from the point view will obey the usual physical conducting experiments them would not indicate any divergence from the physical robin collins responds that energy conservation objections misunderstand the role energy conservation well understood scenarios general relativity violate energy conservation and quantum mechanics provides precedent for causal interactions correlation without energy momentum argument from brain damage this argument has been formulated paul churchland among the point instances some sort brain damage caused automobile drug pathological etc always the case that the mental substance properties the person are significantly changed the mind were completely separate substance from the how could possible that every single time the brain the mind also indeed very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind mental psychological deterioration change that human beings will undergo when specific parts their brains are the question for the dualist try confront how can all this explained the mind separate and immaterial substance its properties are ontologically independent the property dualism and william emergent seek avoid this they assert that the mind property substance that emerges from the appropriate arrangement physical and therefore could affected any rearrangement phineas gage who suffered destruction one both frontal lobes projectile iron often cited example illustrating that the brain causes gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his this physical the destruction part his therefore caused some kind change his suggesting correlation between brain states and mental similar examples neuroscientist david eagleman describes the case another individual who exhibited escalating pedophilic tendencies two different and each case was found have tumors growing particular part his case studies modern experiments have demonstrated that the relation between brain and mind much more than simple specific areas the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions and reliably obtaining the same results measures mental state and neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage the brain and mental deterioration likely this conclusion further supported data from the effects active chemicals such those affecting neurotransmitters mental but also from research neurostimulation direct electrical stimulation the including transcranial magnetic stimulation argument from biological development another common argument against dualism consists the idea that since human beings both phylogenetically and ontogenetically begin their existence entirely physical material entities and since nothing outside the domain the physical added later the course then must necessarily end being fully developed material there nothing material mentalistic involved the formation the blastula the gastrula and the postulation physical mind would seem citation needed argument from neuroscience neurophilosophy neuroscience free will thought identification some the decisions that person makes can detected seconds advance means scanning their brain furthermore subjective experiences and covert attitudes can can mental this strong empirical evidence that cognitive processes have physical basis the argument from simplicity the argument from simplicity probably the simplest and also the most common form argument against dualism the the dualist always faced with the question why anyone should find necessary believe the existence ontologically entities mind and when seems possible and would make for simpler thesis test against scientific explain the same events and properties terms heuristic principle science and philosophy not assume the existence more entities than necessary for clear explanation and prediction see occam razor this argument was criticized peter glassen debate with smart the pages philosophy the late and early glassen argued because not physical occam razor cannot consistently appealed physicalist materialist justification mental states such the belief that dualism the idea that razor may not unrestricted normally described applying all qualitative even abstract but instead concrete only applies physical one applies razor then recommends monism until pluralism either receives more until one applies razor only then may not used abstract concepts this however has serious consequences for selecting between
