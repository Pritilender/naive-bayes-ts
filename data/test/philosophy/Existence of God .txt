philosophy religion and popular culture the western tradition philosophical discussion the existence god began with plato and aristotle who made arguments that would now categorized cosmological other arguments for the existence god have been proposed anselm who formulated the first ontological argument ibn rushd and aquinas who presented their own versions the cosmological argument the kalam argument and the first way respectively descartes who said that the existence benevolent god was logically necessary for the evidence the senses and immanuel kant who argued that the existence god can deduced from the existence good thinkers who have provided arguments against the existence god include david hume kant nietzsche and bertrand russell modern the question existence has been discussed scientists such stephen hawking francis collins richard dawkins and john lennox well philosophers including richard swinburne alvin plantinga william lane craig daniel dennett edward feser and david

god force contained every imaginable for baruch spinoza and his followers use the term god particular philosophical sense mean the essential principles modern western the concept god typically entails

reality ultimately seen qualityless changeless nirguna brahman advaitin philosophy introduces the concept saguna brahman ishvara way talking about brahman ishvara ascribed such qualities omnipotence and ignosticism ignosticism igtheism the theological position that every other theological position including agnosticism and atheism assumes too much about the concept god and many other theological can defined encompassing two related views about the existence the view that coherent definition god must presented before the question the existence god can meaningfully furthermore that definition unfalsifiable the ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the question the existence god per that this the concept god not considered the term god considered the second view synonymous with theological and skips the step first asking what meant before proclaiming the original question does god some philosophers have seen ignosticism variation agnosticism atheism while

studies the origin and scope knowledge from epistemological distinguished from mere belief justification warrant other such property the having which conducive getting the knowledge the sense understanding fact truth can divided into posteriori knowledge based experience deduction see methodology and priori knowledge from introspection axioms self evidence knowledge can also described psychological state since strict sense there can never posteriori knowledge proper see relativism much the disagreement about proofs existence due different conceptions not only the term god but also the terms proof truth and knowledge religious belief from revelation enlightenment satori can fall into either the first posteriori knowledge rooted deduction personal the priori class based different conclusions the existence god often rest different criteria for deciding what methods are appropriate for deciding something true including whether logic counts evidence concerning the quality existence whether subjective experience counts evidence for objective reality whether either logic evidence can rule out the supernatural whether object the mind accepted for existence whether truthbearer can the problem the supernatural one problem posed the question the existence god that traditional beliefs usually ascribe god various supernatural powers supernatural beings may able conceal and reveal themselves for their own for example the tale baucis and philemon according concepts god not part the natural but the ultimate creator nature and the scientific thus aristotelian philosophy god viewed part the explanatory structure needed support scientific and any powers god possesses strictly the natural that derived from place originator see also monadology some religious apologists offer the supernatural nature god the explanation for the inability empirical methods decide the question karl popper philosophy science belief supernatural god outside the natural domain scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must falsifiable the natural the non overlapping magisteria view proposed stephen jay gould also holds that the existence god irrelevant and beyond the domain logical positivists such rudolf carnap and ayer viewed any talk gods literal for the logical positivists and adherents similar schools statements about religious other transcendent experiences could not have truth and were deemed without because metaphysical naturalism the philosophical basis for logical automatically excludes the possibility the supernatural priori without the christian biologist scott todd put even all the data pointed intelligent such hypothesis excluded from science because not this argument limits the domain science the empirically observable and limits the domain god the nature relevant arguments since god the kind which the arguments neither entity the universe nor mathematical not obvious what kinds proofs are relevant even the concept scientific proof were not the fact that there conclusive scientific proof the god mainly demonstrates that the existence god not scientific john polkinghorne suggests that the nearest analogy the existence god physics are the ideas quantum mechanics which are seemingly paradoxical but make sense great deal disparate alvin plantinga compares the question the existence god the question the existence other minds claiming both are notoriously impossible prove against determined one suggested writers such stephen unwin treat particular versions theism and naturalism though they were two hypotheses the bayesian sense list certain data alleged about the and suggest that the likelihoods these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the most the arguments the existence god can seen pointing particular aspects the universe this almost all cases not seriously suggested proponents the arguments that they are merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the however since assessment the weight evidence depends the prior probability that assigned each arguments that theist finds convincing may seem thin atheist and philosophers such wittgenstein take view that considered realist and oppose philosophical arguments related for charles taylor contends that the real whatever will not cannot reduce talk about god anything replace prove then perhaps god real anything george berkeley treatise concerning the principles human knowledge argued that naked cannot and that perception was therefore only minds could proven since all else was merely idea conveyed this viewpoint has been used popular including the matrix movie from this berkeley argued that the universe based upon observation and however noted that the universe includes ideas not perceptible mankind not always and that there must therefore exist omniscient which perceives such berkeley considered this proof the existence the christian outside western thought existence absolute

god empirical arguments aquinas five ways quinque viae unmoved mover first cause argument from contingency argument from degree teleological argument the first part his summa theologica thomas aquinas developed his five arguments for these arguments are grounded aristotelian ontology and make use the infinite regression argument aquinas did not intend fully prove the existence god orthodoxly conceived with all his traditional but proposed his five ways first which built upon later his aquinas five ways argued from the unmoved mover first cause necessary being argument from degree and the teleological argument the unmoved mover argument asserts from our experience motion the universe motion being the transition from potentiality can see that there must have been initial aquinas argued that whatever motion must put motion another there must unmoved aquinas argument from first cause started with the premise that impossible for being cause itself because would have exist before caused and that impossible for there infinite chain which would result infinite regress therefore there must first itself the argument from necessary being asserts that all beings are contingent meaning that possible for them not aquinas argued that everything can possibly not there must have been time when nothing things exist there must exist being with necessary existence regarded aquinas argued from degree considering the occurrence degrees believed that things which are called must called good relation standard there must maximum goodness that which causes all the teleological argument asserts the view that things without intelligence are ordered towards aquinas argued that unintelligent objects cannot ordered unless they are done intelligent which means that there must intelligent being move objects their god rational warrant philosopher stephen notable for his work the history ideas that features the warrant statement that connects the premises joseph hinman applied approach his argument for the existence particularly his book the trace rational warrant for instead attempting prove the existence hinman argues you can demonstrate the rationally warranted nature hinman uses wide range including ones robert andrew mathes and kathleen nobel establish that mystical experiences are transformative way that positive and draws additional work add several additional major points his first the people who have these experiences not only not exhibit traditional signs mental illness often are better mental and physical health than the general population due the second the experiences other they provide framework for navigating life that useful and all the evidence the positive the experience upon lives adapting term from terms the trace the footprints left behind that point the impact discusses how both religious experience and belief god and has always normative among people not need prove the existence there need hinman and the trace god for the impact mystical experiences belief god rationally deductive arguments ontological argument ontological argument the ontological argument has been formulated philosophers including anselm and ren descartes the argument proposes that existence the depending the reads roughly god the greatest conceivable greater exist than not therefore god thomas aquinas criticized the argument for proposing definition god god transcendent should impossible for immanuel kant criticized the proof from logical stated that the term god really signifies two different both idea and kant concluded that the proof based the ambiguity the word kant also challenged the assumption that existence predicate because does not add anything the essence existence not then not necessarily true that the greatest possible being common rebuttal critique although existence does add something both the concept and the reality the concept would vastly different its referent was unreal citation needed another response kant attributed alvin plantinga who explains that even one were grant kant that existence not real necessary which the correct formulation understanding real thus according plantinga argument other arguments these two arguments follow from possible deductions they can set deductions and therefore are placed argument from argument from being one type view ontologically considered inductive

result physical and one could not even suppose except the anthropic argument suggests that basic such are best explained the existence qualia based some philosophers see the existence qualia the hard problem consciousness strong arguments against materialism and therefore for the existence material and immaterial the teleological argument argues that the universe order and complexity are best explained reference creator starts with rather more complicated claim about the that exhibits order and this argument has two one based the analogy design and the other arguing that goals can only

specific moments especially the exodus and the giving the ten commandments front all the tribes positing argument from empirical evidence stemming from sheer number thus demonstrating his the argument from the resurrection jesus this asserts that there sufficient historical evidence for resurrection support his claim the son god and fortiori god this one several arguments known the christological argument islam asserts that the revelation its holy the qur vindicates its divine and thus the existence the church jesus christ day saints also known mormonism similarly asserts that the miraculous appearance jesus and angels joseph smith and others and subsequent finding and translation the book mormon establishes the existence the whole latter day saint movement makes the same claim for example community christ church christ temple church jesus christ church jesus christ latter day saints church jesus christ etc the church jesus christ latter day saints similarly asserts that the finding and translation the plates laban also known the brass plates into the book the law the lord and voree plates james strang one mighty and strong establishes the existence various sects that

word the lord brought mankind angel establishes the existence arguments from testimony arguments from testimony rely the testimony experience possibly embodying the propositions specific revealed religion swinburne argues that principle rationality that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing the witness argument gives credibility personal witnesses contemporary and throughout the variation this the argument from miracles also referred the priest which relies testimony supernatural events establish the existence the majority argument argues that

protestantism are sometimes called born again christians the scottish school common sense led thomas reid taught that the fact the existence god accepted people without knowledge reasons but simply natural that god this school one the chief metaphysical principles that people accept not because they are evident themselves because they can but because common sense obliges people accept the argument from proper basis argues that belief god properly that similar statements like see feel such beliefs are falsifiable thus neither provable nor they concern perceptual beliefs indisputable mental germany the school friedrich heinrich jacobi taught that human reason able perceive the jacobi distinguished three sense reason and just sense has immediate perception the material has reason immediate perception the while the understanding brings these perceptions consciousness and unites them one god then cannot proven like immanuel kant rejected the absolute value the principle must felt the emile jean jacques rousseau asserted that when understanding ponders over the existence god encounters nothing but the impulses however are more value than the and these proclaim clearly the truths natural namely the existence god and the immortality the soul the same theory was advocated germany friedrich schleiermacher who assumed inner religious sense means which people feel religious according religion consists solely this inner and dogmatic doctrines are many modern protestant theologians follow and teach that the existence god cannot certainty this truth only furnished people inner feeling and modernist christianity also denies the demonstrability the existence according one can only know something god means the vital that under favorable circumstances the need the divine dormant subconsciousness becomes conscious and arouses that religious feeling experience which god reveals condemnation this view the oath against modernism formulated pius pope the catholic church

the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results some future neither can super non intelligent qualities like adrsta unseen force being the metaphysical link between work

complete touched upon jean paul sartre being and nothingness sartre phrasing that god would pour soi who also soi which contradiction the argument echoed thus salman rushdie novel grimus that which complete also the argument tries show that omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason act any specifically creating the because would have wants desires since these very concepts are subjectively since the universe there and omnipotent god cannot this argument expounded upon scott adams the book god debris which puts forward form pandeism its fundamental theological similar argument put forward ludwig von mises human referred the praxeological and claimed that perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would longer able take action the present without proving that had been unable achieve its wants showing the historical argument concludes that since most theistic religions throughout history ancient egyptian religion ancient greek religion and their gods ultimately come regarded untrue all theistic including contemporary are therefore most likely incorrect implied part stephen roberts popular contend that are both just believe one fewer god than you when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible you will understand why dismiss subjective arguments anecdotal evidence similar the subjective arguments for the

what seen the power conclusions eurobarometer conclusions the existence god can divided along numerous producing variety orthogonal theism and atheism are positions belief lack while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions knowledge the lack ignosticism concerns belief regarding conceptual apatheism concerns belief regarding the practical importance whether god theism the theistic conclusion that there sufficient reason believe that god gods that arguments not matter much the personal witness the holy argued preeminent apologist william lane the catholic church following the teachings saint paul the apostle saint thomas aquinas and the first vatican council which affirms that existence can known with certainty from the created world the natural light human christian theologians and philosophers make distinction preambles faith and articles the preambles include alleged truths contained revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable the immortality the the existence the articles the other contain truths that cannot proven reached reason alone and presuppose the truths the the holy not demonstrable and presupposes the existence the argument that the existence god can known even prior exposure any divine predates paul made this argument when said that pagans were without excuse because since the creation the world invisible namely his eternal power and has been clearly perceived the things that have been this paul alludes the proofs for later enunciated thomas and but that had also been explored the greek another apologetical school including dutch and american reformed thinkers such abraham kuyper benjamin warfield herman dooyeweerd emerged the late this school was instituted cornelius van til and came popularly called presuppositional apologetics though van til himself felt transcendental would more accurate the main distinction between this approach and the more classical evidentialist approach that the presuppositionalist denies any common ground between the believer and the except that which the believer namely the assumption the truth the theistic other presuppositionalists not believe that the existence god can proven appeal uninterpreted brute facts which have the same meaning people with fundamentally different because they deny that such condition even they claim that the only possible proof for the existence god that the very same belief the necessary condition the intelligibility all other human experience and they attempt prove the existence god means appeal the transcendental necessity the indirectly appeal the unavowed presuppositions the rather than directly appeal some form common practice this school utilizes what have come known transcendental arguments these arguments they claim demonstrate that all human experience and action even the condition itself proof for the existence because existence the necessary condition their alvin plantinga presents argument for the existence god using modal logic others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence god miss the the word god has meaning human culture and history that does not correspond the beings whose existence supported such assuming they are the real question not whether most perfect uncaused first exist the real question whether jehovah zeus krishna any gods any religion and which the other many theists equate all monotheistic henotheistic most perfect matter what name assigned the one monotheistic god one example would understanding the muslim allah christian yhwh and chinese shangdi different names for the same most these arguments not resolve the issue which these figures more likely these arguments fail make the distinction between immanent gods and transcendent some christians note that the christian faith teaches salvation faith and that faith reliance upon the faithfulness the most extreme example this position called fideism which holds that faith simply the will and argues that existence were rationally faith its existence would become ren kierkegaard argued that objective such unimportant god could rationally his existence would unimportant citation needed because god cannot rationally proven that his existence important the justification knowledge the calvinist theologian robert reymond argues that believers should not attempt prove the existence since believes all such proofs are fundamentally believers should not place their confidence much less resort them discussions with rather they should accept the content revelation reymond position similar that his mentor gordon clark which holds that all worldviews are based certain unprovable first premises axioms and therefore are ultimately the christian theist therefore must simply choose start with christianity rather than anything leap faith this position also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics but should not confused with the van tillian atheism atheism the atheistic conclusion that the arguments and evidence both indicate there insufficient reason believe that any gods and that personal subjective religious experiences are indistinguishable from therefore one should not believe that god positive atheism negative and positive atheism positive atheism also called strong and hard form atheism that asserts that deities exist the strong atheist explicitly asserts the existence some strong atheists further assert that the existence gods logically stating that the combination attributes which god may asserted have omnipotence omniscience omnipresence transcendence omnibenevolence are logically incomprehensible and therefore the existence such god priori false metaphysical naturalism common worldview associated with strong science refutes isaacson argues empirical form strong god the world opposed being abstract then science effectively proves there because the absence evidence there more reason believe that world exists than there believe that zeus exists that santa claus the tooth fairy the loch ness monster bigfoot the other god abstract then means that god interfere the lives answer there was burning etc negative atheism negative atheism also called weak and soft any type atheism other than wherein person does not believe the existence any but does not explicitly assert there agnosticism agnosticism the view that the truth value certain especially claims about the existence any deity but also other religious and metaphysical claims unknown agnosticism broad umbrella term does not define belief disbelief agnostics may still identify themselves theists strong agnosticism strong agnosticism the belief that impossible for humans know whether not any deities weak agnosticism weak agnosticism the belief that the existence nonexistence deities unknown but not necessarily agnostic theism agnostic theism the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and for agnostic theist believes that the proposition least one deity exists but per believes that the existence gods unknown inherently the agnostic theist may also alternatively agnostic regarding the properties the they believe agnostic atheism agnostic atheism the view those who not claim know the existence any deity but not believe the theologian robert flint explains man have failed find any good reason for believing that there perfectly natural and rational that should not believe that there and although assume superhuman but merely the ordinary human power judging and after investigation into the nature and reach human ending the conclusion that the existence god
