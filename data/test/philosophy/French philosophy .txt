medieval period peter abelard peter abelard peter abelard april was scholastic philosopher theologian and logician the story his affair with and love for has become the chambers biographical dictionary describes him the keenest thinker and boldest theologian the the general importance abelard lies his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner with the object giving formally rational expression received ecclesiastical however his own particular interpretations may have been they were conceived essentially the same spirit the general scheme thought afterwards elaborated the century with approval from the heads the helped establish the ascendancy the philosophical authority aristotle which became firmly established the century after his was this time that the completed organon and gradually all the other works the greek first came available the before his time plato authority was the basis for the prevailing regards his called conceptualism and his attitude the question see scholasticism outside his was ethics that abelard showed greatest activity philosophical laid particular stress upon the subjective intention not the moral least the moral human his thought this anticipating something modern the more remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least the field hardly venturing bring the principles and rules conduct under pure philosophical even after the great ethical inquiries aristotle became fully known pope innocent iii accepted doctrine which amended augustine doctrine original the vatican accepted the view that unbaptized babies did first straight hell but special area limbo limbus they would therefore feel pain but supernatural happiness either only because was they would not able see the deity that created century michel eyquem montaigne may have been but his dogmatic stances made him the father the conformist french his work consists little trials for his filled with autobiographical and casual his intention with these papers was leave something which family could remember was the first person use the word essays and his writings came highly influential upon shakespeare rousseau and nietzsche his radical scepticism summed the phrase que served one the catalysts for ren descartes oeuvre century modern philosophy began france with the philosophy ren descartes his meditations first philosophy changed the primary object philosophical thought from ontology epistemology and overcame the aristotelian dogmatism inherited philosophy from scholasticism the dominant form thought preceding while simultaneously raising some the most fundamental problems for future generations ren descartes ren descartes descartes was concerned with the uncertainty the sciences and the radical scepticism which spread across europe when publications sextus empiricus became descartes desired find indubitable ground which all the sciences could placed and progressively thus rejected anything which appeared uncertain and decided only accept apodeictic knowledge after invoking the possibility omnipotent deceiver reject the external the information given him from his mathematics and descartes discovered least one thing could known himself was then had thus cogito ergo sum therefore became the first principle cartesianism descartes then claimed that because discovered the cogito through perceiving clearly and anything can perceive clearly and distinctly must then argues that can conceive infinite but finite beings cannot produce infinite ideas and hence infinite being must have put the idea into his uses this commonly known ontological argument invoke the existence benevolent god the indubitable foundation that makes all sciences many people admired descartes but were unsatisfied with this some accused him circularity proclaiming his ontological argument uses his definition truth while his proof his definition truth uses his ontological argument hence the problems solipsism truth and the existence the external world came dominate century western another famous problem arises from substance dualism for substance that which can conceived independent everything else and exist independent anything since descartes conceived the mind independent everything else when doubting everything and because wanted god could produce world which only the mind came define the mind different substance from that for the mind defined unextended substance and the body extended this raised the fundamental question how possible that mind and body interact with one nicolas malebranche nicolas malebranche one solution the mind body problem came from cartesian nicolas malebranche malebranche maintained that created substances different kind cannot interact with one believed substances the same kind could not interact either because necessary causation could proposes then that uncreated who brings about that each time one perceives one also perceives hence the doctrine named occasionalism malebranche was known and celebrated his own but has since become somewhat obscure figure the history western his philosophy had profound effect however through its influence upon spinoza and hume whose problem causation was influenced possible that malebranche also influenced george berkeley although rejects any association with malebranche beyond superficial century french philosophy the century was deeply was heavily imbued with enlightenment principles and many its philosophers became critics church and state and promoters rationality and these philosophers would come have deep influence the politics and ideologies france and charles baron montesquieu was social commentator and political his theories deeply influenced the american founders especially his belief that the state powers should separated into legislative executive and judicial branches which formed the basis for separation powers under the united states constitution the spirit the laws montesquieu outlined the view that man and societies are influenced believed that hotter climates create tempered people and colder climates aloof whereas the mild climate france ideal

were those the right free trial and freedom best remembered for his aphorisms and his satire leibniz known candide which tells the tale young believer leibnizian optimism who becomes disillusioned after series jean jacques rousseau distinguished himself from the progressive scientism the enlightenment with his proclamation discourse the arts and sciences that art and science are corruptors human furthermore caused controversy with his theory that man good nature but corrupted which direct contradiction the christian doctrine original some his theories continue such his idea called the general will which has been both accused fascism and praised for its socialist rousseau thought highly influenced the french revolution his critique private property has been seen forbear marxist ideology and his picture was the only one grace the home immanuel kant was highly praised the french that his remains were moved the panth denis diderot was key collaborator the creation the encyclop

controversial fear the encyclop dia that diderot had worked for twenty years was ruined beyond century auguste comte auguste comte was philosopher born montpellier was the founder the discipline sociology and the doctrine positivism and may regarded the first philosopher science the modern sense the strongly influenced the utopian socialist henri simon comte developed the positive philosophy attempt remedy the social malaise the french revolution calling for new social paradigm based the comte offered account social evolution proposing that society undergoes three phases its quest for the truth according general law three stages comte stages were the theological the metaphysical and the positive comte attempted introduce cohesive religion humanity which though largely was influential the development various secular humanist organizations the also created and defined the term altruism comte was considerable influence century impacting the work thinkers such karl marx and john stuart mill ferdinand saussure ferdinand saussure was swiss linguist who taught for many years was concerned with distinguishing linguistics from philology moving from the study the history individual words and comparisons languages the study the essential underlying structures his small output most which was published became the foundations linguistics semiotics and structuralism the school philosophy concerned with the underlying structures which limit and affect language and the human saussure divided language into two the langue which the system signs and rules owned and parole the individual acts speech within the given this was likened saussure chess and game for before anyone can they have know the rules and structure the for the essential unit any language the like divides the word into two inseparable the which the sound and the which the concept associated with the saussure stressed the arbitrariness this maintaining that any signifier can refer any how sign obtains its meaning what not within the not what for the word means dog simply because does not mean bird can already seen clearly that language highly dualistic for indeed maintained that man thought essentially for the way language can studied dualistic can studied complete system within frozen moment can studied which the examination its historical can said that structuralists focussed the synchronic aspects while poststructuralists reaction toward the highly dualistic and deterministic focussed the diachronic aspects culture attempt invoke grey henri bergson while ferdinand saussure was relatively obscure thinker his may said that henri bergson was somewhat his philosophy appealed both academics and the general public from its first inception death the early although major influence william james alfred north whitehead jean paul sartre emmanuel vinas maurice ponty and the novelist marcel proust interest his work greatly decreased after however the late through the works proclaimed bergsonian gilles deleuze came revitalization interest henri all henri works were concerned with his theory real time experienced came the idea while trying improve the evolutionary philosophy herbert spencer and has likened the rolling and unrolling thread represent sense mortality and the continual gain new spectrum thousand shades with current feeling running through

these images are insufficient and can only show the idea the first too the second juxtaposed and complete whereas time constant state and the third forgets the heterogeneous nature the bergson maintains that the case the same for any other image the idea one can bergson calls this idea duration and defines being not unextended not multiplicity yet mobile and continuously interpenetrating

recreates one will either reconstruct unity hence substance pluralism and substance monism are fact two representations the same century twentieth century french philosophy french philosophy the century saw the rise many schools was heavily influenced german particularly the phenomenology husserl and heidegger presented cartesian phenomenology was consistently noticeable throughout the whereas existentialism spread throughout the west and gained only die out somewhat with the advent structuralism which came seen merely necessary means access post structuralism while postmodern thought came dominate the late phenomenology phenomenology can defined way philosophizing which involves descriptive explanations phenomena given consciousness and how given which attempts avoid imposed phenomenology was seen radical cartesianism which rejected substance dualism better understand transcendental played major role existentialism and many postmodern thought such gilles deleuze and jacques derrida who actually began his career with critical study edmund husserl phenomenology still important area research france emmanuel vinas was one the first introduce phenomenology through his translation edmund cartesian meditations vinas considered ethics primary philosophy and once proclaimed that precedes metaphysics and should considered the first developed moral philosophy based around notions the other and the face which introduced ethics into which had been missing since the demise max scheler maurice ponty was concerned with the foundations his theory the body was produced alternative ren descartes cogito and substance dualism contrast the clear distinction between the mind and the external where the latter but extension the the body existential account the reflective the perception and the world intricately existentialism existentialism was prominent school thought the first half the traditionally existentialism concerned with the human exploring such topics freedom and the experience the can trace its roots back philosophers such ren kierkegaard friedrich nietzsche and martin heidegger well lebensphilosophie but bloomed with the thought french phenomenologist jean paul sartre jean paul sartre defined his existentialism drawing all the conclusions from consistent line his major thesis that existence precedes with immaterial such artisan devises such that slicing and then produces object whose purpose fulfil its however without there artisan who developed the essence man teleological first man born thrown into the world where sole responsibility for his actions rests his then through his actions defines the essence not only but what believes man ought the denial this responsibility through excuses what sartre termed bad faith jean paul sartre was spokesman for but his influence waned with the advent albert camus rejected being labelled preferring called the opening pages the myth sisyphus states what considers the fundamental question suicide the correct response absurd likening godless life the story sisyphus where doomed forever push rock hill only for roll down camus answer requires the struggle itself enough fill one must imagine sisyphus simone beauvoir was existential feminist beauvoir believed that through surrounding women false aura man had turned her into the furthermore she proclaimed women were stereotyped this aura and that was used man excuse for not understanding them and dominating the always the but beauvoir maintains that thesis what applies women much does men and that through their choices and women can transcend this aura and reject being the citation needed structuralism previously french structuralism primarily concerned with the underlying structures which limit and affect language and the human finds its roots the thought ferdinand saussure who was concerned with linguistics but soon structuralism began applied anthropology social sciences and psychology structuralism played major role intellectual thought after world war where rejected existential concepts freedom for the idea man determined structures the thought such thinkers claude strauss and jacques lacan however the end the century became perceived important not for but for the schools thought such poststructuralism and deconstruction claude strauss applied structuralism perhaps most famously the dreams roland barthes was literary critic and semiologist who applied thought literary mythologies barthes explored advertisements movies etc demonstrate the seated bourgeois propaganda found described these myths order certain form green bottles signify red the bourgeois then assign second signifier this that healthy strong sell products uphold the status jacques lacan was psychoanalyst who sought explain the mind terms structures both order correct perceived errors thought well errors the subsequent interpretation freud through the theories strauss and lacan was also influenced german philosophers hegel and martin heidegger through alexandre lectures phenomenology spirit poststructuralism and postmodernism jean ois lyotard metanarratives bracha ettinger the second half the century saw the rise called postmodern thought this rise was especially noticeable however the term fairly hard some people maintain that nothing but slur applied group disparate philosophers wrongly grouped however can also seen critique traditional western particularly dichotomies and the belief influenced heavily structuralism phenomenology and existentialism louis althusser and his prominently including tienne balibar reworked marxism using insights from against the called humanist trend sartrean and western althusser offered influential new reading describing epistemological between the hegelian marx and the late marx das kapital with his focus the economic level and althusser came into conflict with social such thompson jean ois lyotard defined postmodernism scepticism toward metanarratives metanarrative kind grand arching story that encompasses and claims predict everything example marxism which explains the communist the inevitable historical synthesis the proletariat and capitalist modern capitalist class lyotard considered the metanarrative essential feature hence the postmodern condition the replacement metanarratives with multiplicity call them the appellation lyotard gave language games lyotard maintained that these language games lack any embracing structure but were brought about technological developments such fields communication and mass media making metanarratives michel foucault maintained similar scepticism about such right and sane and and human his method was not deny such but historicize examining what the supposedly necessary may and demonstrating the relationships between knowledge and power and his main fields investigation were medicine and disciplinary foucault was hegelian and teleological his historical through his examinations psychiatry madness and civilization showed that the development psychiatry was not obvious improvement previous treatments the and that the apparent scientific neutrality psychiatric treatments hides the fact that they are form controlling defiance bourgeois jacques derrida developed deconstruction response structuralism deconstruction takes examines binary oppositions within from several different interpreting and then attempts show them dependent upon one unstable ambiguous and historically and culturally through showing the fluidity the deconstruction shows the fluidity the derrida maintained that meaning not even the dichotomies classical philosophers took for through internal the text deconstructs itself and hence allows highly original jean baudrillard was concerned with the concealment the fact that there are truths given termed this concealment simulacra example gives the borges story empire that creates map which was accurate that laid over and covered the entire city the map grew when the empire and decayed when the empire when the empire was the only object left was the for people live the map and hence reality crumbles because eventually the difference between reality and illusion becomes indistinguishable for the baudrillard called this hyperreality example this reality which dependent the watcher embracing create the illusion that mirrors gilles deleuze developed philosophy difference which valued the simulacrum higher than the idea and its which inversion which held the idea and its copy high esteem and neglected the simulacrum saw difference prior identity and reason not but little haven built the duration likened where you accept original sin and immaculate then all makes deleuze also developed constructivist view philosophy the job developing just like the job produce poems and the job paint for these deleuze developed idiosyncratic way reading philosophers which once referred would use them stepping stones for creating new concepts which appear belong the philosopher but are utterly example that spinoza whom deleuze read alain badiou born marxist philosopher and former student althusser who currently among the leading french philosophers and public his work ranges from mathematics and most well known for original theories the subject and the popularly known for interventions into
