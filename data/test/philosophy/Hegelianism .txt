right hegelians young hegelians the secret hegel hegelianism the philosophy hegel which can summed the dictum that the rational alone which means that all reality capable being expressed rational his goal was reduce reality more synthetic unity within the system transcendental idealism contents method doctrine development categorization philosophies division philosophy philosophy nature philosophy mind philosophy history stages history philosophy absolute mind influence the hegelian schools germany other nations references method hegel method philosophy consists the triadic development entwicklung each concept and each thus philosophy will not contradict but will give data experience the which the ultimately true for wish know what liberty take that concept where first find the unrestrained action the who does not feel the need repressing any feeling tendency next find that the savage has given this freedom exchange for its the considers the tyranny civilization and finally the citizen under the rule find the third stage namely liberty higher and fuller sense than how the savage possessed the liberty say and think many things beyond the power the this triadic the second stage the direct the least the sublation the the third stage the first returned itself truer richer and fuller the three stages therefore styled itself sich out itself anderssein and for itself sich these three stages are found succeeding one another throughout the whole realm thought and from the most abstract logical process the most complicated concrete activity organized mind the succession states the production systems doctrine development logic which according really metaphysic have deal with the process development applied reality its most abstract according deal concepts robbed their empirical logic are discussing the process vacuo thus the very beginning study finds the logical concept now being not static concept according aristotle supposed essentially because tends its very nature pass over into and then return itself the higher becoming for there was nothing more certain than that being equaled other that being identical with that everything what hegel does not deny but equally certain that being tends become its nothing and that both are united the concept for the truth about this for that this not necessarily aristotle made distinction between things made art and things made nature things made such follow this description living things however are generating and constantly creating their own being the sense living thing highly dynamic and defined the thing creating its own describes life not terms being but for instance goal become neither absolutely young absolutely old and somewhere the process being young and becoming sounds like hegel made the comparison between being and not being while aristotle made the comparison between art and for the equally important truth that was and will ashes the whole for that the tree became table and will become thus becoming not the highest expression also the highest expression thought because then only attain the fullest knowledge thing when know what what and what will when know the history its the same way being and nothing develop into the higher concept farther the scale life and mind appear the third terms the process and turn are developed into higher forms interesting here note that aristotle saw being superior becoming because anything which still becoming something else hence god for perfect because never but eternally but one cannot help asking what that develops its hegel different each the lowest form being higher life and still higher form mind the only thing always present the process das werden however call the process the name spirit geist idea begriff may even call because least the third term every triadic development the process categorization philosophies division philosophy the first and most reaching consideration the process god the reveals the truth that the idea must studied this the subject logic out this the subject the philosophy nature and and for this the subject the philosophy mind geistesphilosophie philosophy nature passing over the rather abstract considerations which hegel shows his logik the process the itself through being and finally through essence take the study the development the idea the point where enters into otherness nature the idea has lost because has lost its unity and into thousand but the loss unity only because reality the idea has merely concealed its studied nature reveals itself many successful attempts the idea emerge from the state otherness and present itself fuller richer namely spirit mind therefore the goal also the truth for whatever nature realized higher form the mind which emerges from philosophy mind the philosophy mind begins with the consideration the mind soon however that mind only the first the itself the next stage objective mind objectified morality and the this mind the condition there follows the condition absolute the state which mind rises above all the limitations nature and and subjected itself alone religion and for the essence mind freedom and its development must consist breaking away from the restrictions imposed otherness nature and human philosophy history hegel philosophy the his theory and his account absolute mind are perhaps the most interesting portions his philosophy because the most easily the mind the individual which account its its prejudices and its blind impulses only partly subjects itself the yoke the opposite order attain fuller realization itself the freedom the this yoke necessity first met with the recognition the rights next morality and finally social which the primal institution the family aggregates families form civil which however but imperfect form organization compared with the the state the perfect social embodiment the and stands this stage development for god the studied furnishes for our consideration constitutional law relation other states develops international and its general course through historical vicissitudes passes through what hegel calls the dialectics hegel teaches that the constitution the collective spirit the nation and that the government and the written constitution the embodiment that each nation has its own individual and the greatest crimes the act which the tyrant the conqueror stifles the spirit war hegel can never ruled one can never know when one will example being the napoleonic overrunning europe and putting down royalist course war day and for much history involved mainly combatants unlike today where civilians form the majority war represents crisis the development the idea which embodied the different and out this crisis usually the state which holds the more advanced spirit wins though may also suffer lick its yet still win the spiritual happened for example when the northerners sacked its form legality and religion all won out spite the losses the peaceful revolution also possible according hegel when the changes required solve the crisis are ascertained thoughtful insight and when this insight spreads throughout the body people volk can longer accept implicitly true what its constitution expresses the its consciousness notion and its actuality are not then the spirit torn two things may then first the people may either supreme internal effort dash into fragments this law which still claims may more quietly and slowly effect changes the yet operative which however longer true but which the mind has already passed the second intelligence and strength may not suffice for and may hold the lower may happen that another nation has reached its higher thereby rising the and the first gives its nationality and becomes subject the therefore essential importance know what the true constitution for what opposition has and passes has temporary but cannot hold its has been but cannot secure permanent that must cast lies the very nature the this insight can reached through philosophy revolutions take place state without the slightest violence when the insight becomes institutions somehow crumble and each man agrees give his government however recognize that the time for this has should the knowing not the cling temporary taking though bulwark guarding from the essential and the essential what contained the that government will along with its before the force the breaking its government breaks the nation new government may that the government and the unessential retain the upper the ground historical development therefore rational since the not the embodiment reason many first considered contingent events history can reality stages the logical unfolding the sovereign reason which gets embodied advanced such necessary when expressed impulse interest character personality get used the cunning which was its own stages history therefore understand historical happenings the reluctant working reason towards the full realization itself perfect consequently must interpret history rational and throw the succession events into logical categories and this interpretation for mere inference from actual thus the widest view history reveals three most important stages oriental imperial the stage suppression greek social democracy the stage which freedom was lost unstable demagogy and christian constitutional monarchy which represents the reintegration freedom constitutional government philosophy absolute mind even the mind limited subjection other there remains the final step the process the acquisition namely that which absolute mind art religion and philosophy subjects itself itself mind has the intuitive contemplation itself realized the art and the development the arts has been conditioned the increasing docility with which the art material lends itself the actualization mind the mind feels the superiority itself the particularizing limitations finite here the philosophy there are three great oriental religion which exaggerated the idea the greek religion which gave undue importance the and christianity which represents the union the infinite and the last absolute transcends the limitations imposed even religious and discarding representative attains all truth under the form whatever truth there art and religion contained higher and free from all philosophy therefore the freest and wisest phase the union subjective and objective and the ultimate goal all influence the far reaching influence hegel due measure the undoubted vastness the scheme philosophical synthesis which conceived and partly philosophy which undertook organize under the single formula triadic development every department from abstract logic the philosophy has great deal attractiveness those who are metaphysically but influence due still larger measure two extrinsic his philosophy the highest expression that spirit collectivism which characterized the nineteenth theology especially hegel revolutionized the methods the application his notion development biblical criticism and historical investigation obvious anyone who compares the spirit and purpose contemporary theology with the spirit and purpose the theological literature the first half the nineteenth citation needed too and the substitution the category becoming for the category being very patent and due the influence political economy and political science the effect collectivistic conception the state supplanted large extent the individualistic conception which was handed down from the eighteenth century the nineteenth the hegelian schools hegelian rightists young hegelians germany hegel immediate followers germany are generally divided into the right hegelians and the left hegelians the latter also referred the young the rightists developed his philosophy along lines which they considered accordance with christian they included karl friedrich schel johann philipp gabler johann karl friedrich rosenkranz and johann eduard erdmann the leftists accentuated the christian tendencies system and developed schools materialism socialism rationalism and pantheism they included ludwig feuerbach karl marx bruno bauer and david strauss max stirner socialized with the left hegelians but built his own philosophical system largely opposing that these other nations britain
