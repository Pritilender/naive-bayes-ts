presumption that hereditary prince has easier task since the people are accustomed retain the hereditary prince must carefully maintain the political institutions which the people are whereas new prince has the more difficult task since must first stabilize his found power order build enduring political that requires the prince being public figure above whilst privately acting amorally achieve state the examples are those princes who most successfully obtain and maintain drawn from his observations florentine and his ancient history readings thus the latin phrases and classic the prince does not dismiss instead politically defines the criteria for acceptable cruel action must decisive swift effective and machiavelli aware the irony good results coming from evil notwithstanding some mitigating the catholic church proscribed the prince registering the index librorum prohibitorum moreover the humanists also viewed the book among erasmus its primary intellectual contribution the history political thought the fundamental break between political realism and political idealism the prince manual acquiring and keeping political contrast with plato and aristotle classical ideal

and tyrannical princes the prince and his more republican exhortations discorsi many have concluded that the prince actually only jean jacques rousseau for admired machiavelli the republican and consequently argued that the prince book for the republicans exposes the methods used the book was only intended manual for tyrannical contains would apparently more effective the secrets contains would not made publicly also antonio gramsci argued that audience was the common people because the rulers already knew these methods through their this interpretation supported the fact that machiavelli wrote not latin which would have been the language the ruling although machiavelli supposed many his heroes the prince are fact mythical and his goal the unification essentially utopian the time etymologically his century contemporaries adopted and used the adjective machiavellian elaborately often the introductions political tracts offering more than government reasons most notably those jean bodin and giovanni botero while pejorative usage machiavellian anti machiavellism the misnomer describing someone who deceives and manipulates others for gain personal the gain only action insofar effects the prince hasn the moderating themes his other politically denotes someone extreme however machiavellianism remains popular speech and journalism while denotes personality type age enlightenment cesare beccaria crimes and punishments cesare beccaria italy was also affected the movement which was consequence the renaissance and changed the road italian followers the group often met discuss private salons and notably the cities milan rome and venice cities with important universities such padua bologna and naples however also remained great centres scholarship and the with several philosophers such giambattista vico who widely regarded being the founder modern italian and antonio genovesi italian society also dramatically changed during the with rulers such leopold

philosophy italy also had renowned philosophical movement the with idealism sensism and empiricism the main sensist italian philosophers were gioja and romagnosi criticism the sensist movement came from other philosophers such pasquale galluppi who affirmed that priori relationships were antonio rosmini instead was the founder italian the most comprehensive view philosophical standpoint found his sistema filosofico which set forth the conception complete encyclopaedia the human synthetically according the order perfectly harmonious contemplating the position recent philosophy from locke hegel and having his eye directed the ancient and fundamental problem the truth and certainty our philosophy restored love and think will return the teachings the and part give those teachings the benefit modern theodicy examined and analysed the fact human and obtained the following that the notion idea being existence general enters and presupposed all our acquired without they would impossible that this idea essentially inasmuch what seen distinct from and opposed the mind that sees the light from the eye that looks that essentially because being and truth are convertible and because the vision the mind cannot since error could only committed and here there but pure intuition affirming nothing and denying nothing that the application this essentially objective and true idea the human being intellectually first the animal body individually conjoined with and occasion the sensations produced him not the causes those that from the action felt perceives and affirms and therefore true that acts and thus gets the external these are the true primitive containing the subsistence the particular being and its essence species determined the quality the action felt from predicate that separating the essence species from the obtains the full specific idea and then from leaving aside some its the abstract specific idea that the having reached this stage can proceed further and further including the first principles the principles the several complex groups and without end that the same most universal idea this generator and formal element all acquired cannot itself but must innate implanted god our being naturally shining our must therefore what men call the light hence the name rosmini gives ideal and this laid down the fundamental principle all philosophy and the supreme criterion truth and this believed the teaching well whom was ardent admirer and the there were also several other movements which gained some form popularity such ontologism the main italian son this philosophical movement was vincenzo gioberti who was priest and gioberti writings are more important than his political the general history european philosophy they stand the speculations rosmini serbati against which have been called the last link added medieval the system known ontologism more especially his greater and earlier unrelated other modern schools shows harmony with the roman catholic faith which caused cousin declare that italian philosophy was still the bonds theology and that gioberti was method with him subjective and psychological ontology and begins with the ideal the ens creates nihilo the god the only being all other things are merely god the origin all human knowledge called thought which one and say identical with god directly beheld but order use has reflected and this means knowledge being and existences not and their mutual necessary the beginning gioberti some respects platonist identifies religion with and his treatise del primato morale civile degli italiani arrives the conclusion that the church the axis which the being human life affirms the idea the supremacy brought about the restoration the papacy moral founded religion and public his later the rinnovamento and the protologia thought some have shifted his ground under the influence his first written when was had personal reason for its young exile and paolo having many doubts and misgivings the reality revelation and future gioberti once set work with teorica del sovrannaturale which was his first publication after philosophical treatises followed rapid the teorica was followed introduzione allo studio della filosofia three volumes this work states his reasons for requiring new method and new here brings out the doctrine that religion the direct

gathering influence through the work such students ugo benedetto croce wrote that gentile holds the honor having been the most rigorous hegelian the entire history western philosophy and the dishonor having been the official philosopher fascism his philosophical basis for fascism was rooted his understanding ontology and epistemology which found vindication for the rejection individualism acceptance collectivism with the state the ultimate location authority and loyalty which the individual found the conception individuality meaning outside the state which turn justified totalitarianism ultimately gentile foresaw social order wherein opposites all kinds given sanction existing independently from each that and broad interpretations were currently false imposed all former kinds capitalism communism and that only the reciprocal totalitarian state corporative fascist could defeat these problems made from reifying external that which fact gentile only thinking whereas was common the philosophy the time see conditional subject abstract and object gentile postulated the that subject was the concrete and objectification was abstraction that what was conventionally dubbed subject was fact only conditional and that true subject was the act being essence above any gentile was notable philosophical theorist his time throughout since having developed
