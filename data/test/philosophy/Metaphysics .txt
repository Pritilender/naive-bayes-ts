met beyond upon after and physik physics was first used the title for several because they were usually anthologized after the works physics complete the prefix meta beyond indicates that these works come after the chapters however aristotle himself did not call the subject these books metaphysics referred first the editor andronicus rhodes thought have placed the books first philosophy right after another physics and called them meta physika biblia the books that come after the books physics this was misread latin scholiasts who thought meant the science what beyond the however once the name was the commentators sought find intrinsic reasons for its for was understood mean the science the world beyond physis that the science the again was understood refer the chronological

being existence and reality the nature being perennial topic for parmenides taught that reality was single unchanging being the century philosopher heidegger thought previous philosophers had lost sight the question being qua favour the questions beings existing that return the parmenidean approach was ontological catalogue attempt list the fundamental constituents the question whether not existence predicate has been discussed since the early modern not least relation the ontological argument for the existence god existence that something has been contrasted with essence the question what something reflections the nature the connection and distinction between existence and essence dates back aristotle metaphysics and later found one its most influential interpretations the ontology the eleventh century metaphysician avicenna ibn since existence without essence seems associated with nothingness philosophers such empirical and conceptual objects objects and their properties problem universals the world seems contain many individual both like and such love and the number the former objects are called particulars particulars are said have size shape color location and two particulars may have some such attributes such attributes are also termed universals properties the nature and whether they have any real existence and what standing realism and nominalism representing opposing metaphysicians concerned with questions about universals particulars are interested the nature objects and their and the relationship between the some plato argue that properties are abstract existing outside space and time which particular objects bear special david armstrong holds that universals exist time and space but only their instantiation and their discovery function others maintain that particulars are bundle collection properties bundle properties they biological literature contains abundant references taxa singular taxon groups like the mammals the poppies some authors claim least that taxa are real that say that animal included mammalia the scientific name for the mammal say that bears certain relation abstract advocates phylogenetic nomenclature more nominalistic oppose this their calling animal mammal shorthand way saying that descended from the last common ancestor say humans and cosmology and cosmogony cosmology metaphysical cosmology the branch metaphysics that deals with the world the totality all phenomena space and time historically has had quite broad and many cases was founded the ancient greeks drew distinction between this use and their model for the however modern times addresses questions about the universe which are beyond the scope the physical distinguished from religious cosmology that approaches these questions using philosophical methods dialectics cosmogony deals specifically with the origin the modern metaphysical cosmology and cosmogony try address questions such what the origin the what its first its existence see monism pantheism emanationism and creationism what are the ultimate material components the see mechanism dynamism hylomorphism atomism what the ultimate reason for the existence the does the cosmos have see teleology determinism and free will determinism free will determinism the philosophical proposition that every including human decision and causally determined unbroken chain prior holds that random spontaneous stochastic intrinsically miraculous events the principal consequence the deterministic claim that poses challenge the existence free will the problem free will the problem whether rational agents exercise control over their own actions and addressing this problem requires understanding the relation between freedom and and determining whether the laws nature are causally some known incompatibilists view determinism and free will mutually exclusive they believe they will therefore believe free will position known hard determinism proponents range from baruch spinoza ted honderich others labeled compatibilists soft believe that the two ideas can coherently adherents this view include thomas hobbes and many modern philosophers such john martin fischer incompatibilists who accept free will but reject determinism are called libertarians term not confused with the political robert kane and alvin plantinga are modern defenders this identity and change identity and change identity philosophy space and time the greeks took some extreme positions the nature parmenides denied that change occurs while heraclitus thought change was cannot step into the same river identity sometimes called numerical identity the relation that thing bears and which thing bears anything other than itself sameness according leibniz some object identical some object then any property that has will have however too that objects can change over one were look tree one and the tree later lost would seem that one could still looking that same two rival theories account for the relationship between change and identity are perdurantism which treats the tree series and endurantism which maintains that the the same present every stage its mind and matter matter materialism philosophy mind the nature matter was problem its own right early aristotle himself introduced the idea matter general the western adapting the term hyle which originally meant early debates centered identifying single underlying water was claimed thales air anaximenes apeiron the fire heraclitus democritus conjunction with his leucippus conceived atomic theory many centuries before was accepted modern worth however that the grounds necessary ensure validity the proposed veridical nature were not but just philosophical those traditions espoused thales and the nature the mind and its relation the body has been seen more problem science has progressed its mechanistic understanding the brain and proposed solutions often have ramifications about the nature mind ren descartes proposed substance dualism theory which mind and body are essentially with the mind having some the attributes traditionally assigned the soul the seventeenth this creates conceptual puzzle about how the two interact which has received some strange such occasionalism evidence close relationship between brain and such the phineas gage case have made this form dualism increasingly another proposal discussing the body problem idealism which the material sweepingly eliminated favor the idealists such george berkeley claim that material objects not exist unless perceived and only the german such fichte hegel and schopenhauer took kant their although debatable how much idealist kant himself idealism also common theme eastern related ideas are panpsychism and panexperientialism which say everything has mind rather than everything exists alfred north whitehead was century exponent this idealism monistic theory which holds that there single universal substance neutral monism associated different forms with baruch spinoza and bertrand russell seeks less extreme than and avoid the problems substance dualism claims that existence consists single substance that itself neither mental nor but capable mental and physical aspects thus implies dual aspect theory for the last one hundred the dominant metaphysics has without doubt been materialistic monism type identity theory token identity theory functionalism reductive physicalism nonreductive physicalism eliminative materialism anomalous monism property dualism epiphenomenalism and emergence are just some the candidates for scientifically informed account the should noted that while many these positions are none them are substance dualism prominent recent philosophers mind include david armstrong ned block david chalmers patricia and paul churchland donald davidson daniel dennett fred dretske douglas hofstadter jerry fodor david lewis thomas nagel hilary putnam john searle john smart ludwig wittgenstein and fred alan wolf necessity and possibility modal logic modal realism metaphysicians investigate questions about the ways the world could have david lewis the plurality endorsed view called concrete modal realism according which facts about how things could have been are made true other concrete worlds just like which things are other such gottfried leibniz have dealt with the idea possible worlds the idea necessity that any necessary fact true across all possible worlds possible fact true some possible even not the actual for possible that cats could have had two that any particular apple could have not certain propositions seem necessarily such analytic propositions all bachelors are the particular example analytic truth being necessary not universally held among less controversial view might that identity seems fundamentally incoherent claim that for any not identical this known the law identity putative first aristotle describes the principle contradiction impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong the same thing this the most certain all principles wherefore they who demonstrate refer this ultimate for nature the source all the other religion and spirituality theology the study god gods and the nature the whether there god monotheism many gods polytheism gods atheism whether unknown unknowable whether any gods exist agnosticism apophatic theology and whether divine entity directly intervenes the world theism its sole function the first cause the universe deism these and whether god gods and the world are different panentheism and dualism are identical pantheism are some the primary metaphysical questions concerning philosophy within the standard western philosophical theology reached its peak under the medieval school thought known scholasticism which focused primarily the metaphysical aspects christianity the work the scholastics still integral part modern with key figures such thomas aquinas still playing important role the philosophy religion space and time philosophy space and time book the confessions saint augustine hippo asked the fundamental question about the nature traditional realist position ontology that time and space have existence apart from the human idealists including kant claim that space and time are mental constructs used organize are otherwise suppose that one sitting with apple front him the apple exists space and time but what does this statement could for that space like invisible dimensional grid which the apple suppose the and all physical objects the were removed from existence would space invisible still ren descartes and leibniz believed would arguing that without physical space would meaningless because space the framework upon which understand how physical objects are related each newton the other argued for absolute container space the pendulum swung back relational space with einstein and ernst mach while the relative and the realism debate are equally applicable time and time presents some special problems its the flow time has been denied ancient times parmenides and more recently mctaggart his paper the unreality time the direction also known time arrow also although physics now driving the debate rather than appears that fundamental laws are reversible and the arrow time must emergent phenomenon perhaps explained statistical understanding thermodynamic entropy common sense tells that objects persist across that there some sense which you are the same person you were which the oak the same the which you perhaps even can step into the same river philosophers have developed two rival theories for how this called endurantism and perdurantism broadly endurantists hold that whole object exists each moment its and the same object exists each perdurantists believe that objects are dimensional entities made series temporal parts like the frames movie styles and methods metaphysics rational versus empirical rationalism method theory which the criterion the truth not sensory but intellectual and bourke rationalist metaphysicians aim deduce the nature reality priori reasoning empiricism holds that the senses are the primary source knowledge about the analytical versus systemic the system style metaphysics attempts answer all the important questions comprehensive and coherent providing theory everything complete picture the the contrasting approach deal with problems dogmatic versus critical under the scholastic approach the middle number themes and ideas were not open kant and others thought this dogmatism should replaced critical approach individual versus collective scholasticism and analytical philosophy are examples collaborative approaches many other philosophers expounded individual parsimonious versus adequate should metaphysical system posit little much descriptive versus revisionary peter strawson makes the distinction between descriptive which sets out investigate our deepest and revisionary which sets out improve rectify history and schools metaphysics pre socratic metaphysics greece the first known according aristotle thales miletus rejecting mythological and divine sought single first cause arche origin under which all phenomena could and concluded that this first cause was fact moisture thales also taught that the world has harmonious and thus intelligible rational other such anaximander and anaximenes also had monistic conception the first another school was the eleatics italy the group was founded the early fifth century bce parmenides and included zeno elea and melissus samos methodologically the eleatics were broadly and took logical standards clarity and necessity the criteria truth parmenides chief doctrine was that reality single unchanging and universal zeno used reductio absurdum demonstrate the illusory nature change and time his paradoxes heraclitus ephesus made change teaching that all things his expressed brief quite for also taught the unity opposites democritus and his teacher leucippus are known for formulating atomic theory for the they are considered forerunners the scientific socrates and plato socrates known for his dialectic questioning approach philosophy rather than positive metaphysical his plato famous for his theory forms which confusingly places the mouth socrates the dialogues wrote expound platonic realism also considered form idealism considered solution the problem universals what particular objects have common that they share specific form which universal all others their respective the theory has number other epistemological knowledge the forms more certain than mere sensory ethical the form the good sets objective standard for time and the world the forms eternal and time and change belong only the lower sensory time moving image abstract objects and numbers geometrical etc exist independently the world platonism developed into neoplatonism philosophy with monotheistic and mystical flavour that survived well into the early christian aristotle plato pupil aristotle wrote widely almost every including metaphysics his solution the problem universals contrasts with whereas platonic forms exist separate and can exist uninstantiated visible aristotelean essences indwell potentiality and actuality are principles dichotomy which aristotle used throughout his philosophical works analyze motion causality and other the aristotelean theory change and causality stretches four causes the formal efficient and the efficient cause corresponds what now known cause simpliciter final causes are explicitly teleological concept now regarded controversial the form dichotomy was become highly influential later philosophy the essence scholasticism and the middle ages between about and philosophy discipline took place part the catholic church teaching known scholasticism scholastic philosophy took place within established framework blending christian theology with aristotelean although fundamental orthodoxies could not there were nonetheless deep metaphysical particularly over the problem universals which engaged duns scotus and pierre abelard william ockham remembered for his principle ontological rationalism and continental rationalism rationalism the early modern period and the building scope philosophy often linked the rationalist method that the technique deducing the nature the world pure the scholastic concepts substance and accident were leibniz proposed his monadology plurality interacting descartes famous for his dualism material and mental spinoza believed reality was single substance british empiricism british empiricism marked something reaction rationalist and building speculative metaphysics was pejoratively the sceptic david hume famously declared that most metaphysics should consigned the flames see hume was notorious among his contemporaries one the first philosophers openly doubt but better known now for his critique causality john stuart mill thomas reid and john locke were less embracing more cautious style metaphysics based common sense and other notably george berkeley were led from empiricism idealistic kant immanuel kant attempted grand synthesis and revision the trends already scholastic systematic and skeptical not forget the burgeoning science his like the systems had overarching framework which all questions were like who famously woke him from his dogmatic was suspicious metaphysical and also places much emphasis the limitations the human kant saw rationalist philosophers aiming for kind metaphysical knowledge defined the synthetic apriori that knowledge that does not come from the senses priori but nonetheless about reality inasmuch about unlike abstract mathematical propositions which terms analytical and being apriori distinct from scientific knowledge which terms synthetic the only synthetic apriori knowledge can have how our minds organise the data the that organising framework space and which for kant have independent but nonetheless operate uniformly all apriori knowledge space and time all that remains metaphysics traditionally there reality beyond sensory data which calls the realm noumena however cannot know but only appears allows himself speculate that the origins morality and free will might exist the noumenal but these possibilities have set against its basic unknowability for although saw himself having disposed has generally been regarded retrospect having metaphysics his century philosophy was overwhelmingly influenced kant and his schopenhauer schelling fichte and hegel all purveyed their own panoramic versions german idealism kant own caution about metaphysical and refutation idealism having fallen the the idealistic impulse continued into the early century with british idealists such bradley and mctaggart followers karl marx took dialectic view history and fashioned materialism early analytical philosophy and positivism during the period when idealism was dominant science had been making great the arrival new generation scientifically minded philosophers led sharp decline the popularity idealism during the analytical philosophy was spearheaded bertrand russell and moore russell and william james tried compromise between idealism and materialism with the theory neutral monism the early mid century philosophy also saw trend reject metaphysical questions the driving force behind this tendency was the philosophy logical positivism espoused the vienna circle around the same the american pragmatists were steering middle course between materialism and system building with fresh inspiration from was revived whitehead and charles hartshorne continental philosophy the forces that shaped analytical the break with and the influence science were much less significant outside the english speaking although there was shared turn toward continental philosophy continued trajectory from post the phenomenology husserl and others was intended collaborative project for the investigation the features and structure consciousness common all line with basing his synthetic apriori the

blooded later analytical philosophy while early analytic philosophy tended reject metaphysical under the influence logical was revived the second half the twentieth philosophers such david lewis and david armstrong developed elaborate theories range topics such causation possibility and necessity and abstract however the focus analytical philosophy generally away from the construction encompassing systems and towards close analysis individual among the developments that led the revival metaphysical theorizing were quine attack the analytic synthetic distinction which was generally taken undermine carnap distinction between existence questions internal framework and those external the philosophy the problem empty and the debate over status property have all risen out relative obscurity become central while perennial issues such free possible and the philosophy time have had new life breathed into rejections metaphysics number individuals have suggested that much metaphysics should the david hume took extreme arguing that all genuine knowledge involves either mathematics matters fact and that which goes beyond concludes his enquiry concerning human understanding with the does contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity does contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter fact and the ayer and rudolf carnap endorsed carnap quoted the passage they argued that metaphysical statements are neither true nor false but meaningless according their verifiability theory meaning statement meaningful only there can empirical evidence for against thus while ayer rejected the monism noted above avoided commitment the contrary holding both views without carnap took similar line with the controversy over the reality the external years after enquiry appeared immanuel kant published his critique pure reason though followed hume rejecting much previous argued that there was still room for some synthetic priori knowledge concerned with matters fact yet obtainable independent these included fundamental structures time and also argued for the freedom the will and the existence things the ultimate but objects the logical atomist ludwig wittgenstein introduced the concept that metaphysics could influenced theories aesthetics via logic vis world composed atomical arguing against such the scholastic philosopher edward feser has
