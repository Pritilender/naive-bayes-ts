cites the concept tabula rasa where individuals are not born with mental content and that knowledge builds from experience epistemological solipsism the idea that the existence the world outside the mind unresolvable ren descartes parmenides argued that impossible doubt that thinking actually but thinking must have therefore something beyond thinking really parmenides deduced that what really

his original cogito ergo sum from this descartes went construct complete system knowledge which involves proving the existence god using among other version the ontological argument his view that reason alone could yield substantial truths about reality strongly influenced those philosophers usually considered modern rationalists such baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz and christian wolff while

inductive deductive reasoning given certain statements called premises other statements called are unavoidably implied rules inferences from premises include the most popular modus ponens where given and then then must common convention for deductive argument the syllogism argument termed valid its conclusion does follow from its whether the premises are true while argument sound its conclusion follows from premises that are propositional logic uses premises that are propositions which are declarations that are either true while predicate logic uses more complex premises called formulae that contain variables these can assigned values can quantified when they apply with the universal quantifier always the existential quantifier applies least inductive reasoning makes conclusions

metaphysics the study the most general features reality such existence time the relationship between mind and body objects and their properties wholes and their events processes and causation traditional branches metaphysics include cosmology the study the world its and ontology the study being within metaphysics itself there are wide range differing philosophical theories idealism for the belief that reality mentally constructed otherwise immaterial while realism holds that least some part exists independently the subjective idealism describes objects more than collections bundles sense data the the century philosopher george berkeley contended that existence fundamentally tied perception with the phrase esse est aut percipi aut percipere perceived addition the aforementioned however there also ontological dichotomy within metaphysics between the concepts particulars and universals particulars are those objects that are said exist space and opposed abstract objects such universals are properties held multiple such redness the type existence universals and abstract objects issue serious debate within metaphysical realism the philosophical position that universals fact while nominalism the denial abstract conceptualism holds that universals but only within the the question whether not existence predicate has been discussed since the early modern essence the set

europe and the middle east during the middle ages roughly extending from the christianization the roman empire until the medieval philosophy defined partly the rediscovery and further development classical greek and hellenistic philosophy and partly the need address theological problems and integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines abrahamic religion islam judaism and christianity with secular learning the history western european medieval philosophy traditionally divided into two main the period the latin west following the early middle ages until the when the works aristotle and plato were preserved and and the golden citation needed the and centuries the latin which witnessed the culmination the recovery ancient and significant developments the field philosophy religion logic and metaphysics the medieval era was disparagingly treated the renaissance who saw barbaric middle period between the classical age greek and roman and the rebirth renaissance classical yet this period nearly thousand years was the longest period philosophical development and possibly the jorge gracia has argued that sophistication and the philosophical flowering the thirteenth century could rightly said rival the golden age greek philosophy the fourth century some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation faith reason the existence and unity god the object theology and metaphysics the problems and philosophers from the middle ages include the christian philosophers augustine hippo boethius anselm gilbert poitiers peter abelard roger bacon bonaventure thomas aquinas

renaissance renaissance philosophy giordano bruno the renaissance rebirth was period transition between the middle ages and modern which the recovery classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies metaphysics and theology towards eclectic inquiries into philology and the study the classics and the humane arts such history and enjoyed scholarly interest hitherto unknown tendency referred humanism displacing the medieval interest metaphysics and the humanists followed petrarch making man and his virtues the focus the study classical philosophy also developed two new the one the study aristotle was changed through the influence averroism the disagreements between these averroist and more orthodox catholic aristotelians such albertus magnus and thomas aquinas eventually contributed the development humanist developed the exemplified the thought pietro pomponazzi and giacomo zabarella secondly alternative the study plato and the neoplatonists became this was assisted the rediscovery works which had not been well known previously western notable renaissance platonists include nicholas cusa and later marsilio ficino and giovanni pico della mirandola the renaissance also renewed interest aristotelian theories nature considered living whole comprehensible independently the work nicholas cusa nicholas copernicus giordano bruno telesius and tommaso campanella such movements natural philosophy dovetailed with revival interest magic hermeticism and astrology which were thought yield hidden ways knowing and mastering nature marsilio ficino and giovanni pico della these new movements philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations the reformation and the decline feudalism though the theologians the protestant reformation showed little direct interest their destruction the traditional foundations theological and intellectual authority harmonized with revival fideism and skepticism thinkers

after death century philosophy largely turned against idealism favor varieties philosophical naturalism such the positivism auguste comte the empiricism john stuart mill and the materialism karl marx logic began period its most significant advances since the inception the increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields inference formalization the work george boole and gottlob frege other philosophers who initiated lines thought that would continue shape philosophy into the century gottlob frege and henry sidgwick whose work logic and respectively provided the tools for early analytic philosophy charles sanders peirce and william james who founded pragmatism ren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche who laid the groundwork for existentialism and post structuralism century philosophy contemporary philosophy bertrand russell within the last philosophy has increasingly become professional discipline practiced within like other academic accordingly has become less general and more the view one prominent recent philosophy has become highly organized done specialists primarily for other the number philosophers has the volume publication has and the subfields serious philosophical investigation have not only the broad field philosophy today far too vast embraced one something similar true even many highly specialized the speaking analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much the the first half the was cohesive shaped strongly logical positivism united the notion that philosophical problems could and should solved attention logic and language the pioneering work bertrand russell was model for the early development analytic moving from rejection the idealism dominant late century british philosophy humean strengthened the conceptual resources modern mathematical the latter half the analytic philosophy diffused into wide variety disparate philosophical only loosely united historical lines influence and identified commitment clarity and the war transformation the analytic program led two broad one interest ordinary language way avoiding redescribing traditional philosophical and the more thoroughgoing naturalism that sought dissolve the puzzles modern philosophy via the results the natural sciences such cognitive psychology and evolutionary the shift the work ludwig wittgenstein from view congruent with logical positivism therapeutic dissolution traditional philosophy linguistic misunderstanding normal forms was the most influential version the first direction analytic the later work russell and the philosophy quine are influential exemplars the naturalist approach dominant the second half the but the diversity analytic philosophy from the onward defies easy the naturalism quine and his epigoni was some precincts superseded new possible worlds the influential work david lewis recently the experimental philosophy movement has sought reappraise philosophical problems through social science research continental single school temperament enjoyed the flight the logical positivists from central europe during the and however diminished philosophical interest natural and emphasis the broadly figures prominently what usually called continental philosophy century movements such phenomenology existentialism modern hermeneutics critical theory structuralism and poststructuralism are included within this loose the founder edmund husserl sought study consciousness experienced from person while martin heidegger drew the ideas nietzsche and husserl propose unconventional existential approach ontology the speaking world arab nationalist philosophy became the dominant school involving philosophers such michel aflaq zaki arsuzi salah din bitar athism and sati husri these people disregarded much and were mostly concerned with the spirituality which the fight against imperialism and lead united arab nation major traditions german idealism german idealism immanuel kant forms idealism were prevalent philosophy from the century the early transcendental advocated immanuel kant the view that there are limits what can since there much that cannot brought under the conditions objective kant wrote his critique pure reason attempt reconcile the conflicting approaches rationalism and and establish new groundwork for studying kant intention with this work was look what know and then consider what must true about logical consequence the way know one major theme was that there are fundamental features reality that escape our direct knowledge because the natural limits the human although kant held that objective knowledge the world required the mind impose conceptual categorical framework the stream pure sensory framework including space and time maintained that things themselves existed independently our perceptions and was therefore not idealist any simple kant account things themselves both controversial and highly continuing his johann gottlieb fichte and friedrich schelling dispensed with belief the independent existence the and created thoroughgoing idealist the most notable work this german idealism was hegel phenomenology spirit hegel admitted his ideas were not but that all the previous philosophies had been his goal was correctly finish their hegel asserts that the twin aims philosophy are account for the contradictions apparent human experience which for out the supposed contradictions between being and not and also simultaneously resolve and preserve these contradictions showing their compatibility higher level examination being and not are resolved with becoming this program acceptance and reconciliation contradictions known the hegelian dialectic philosophers influenced hegel include ludwig andreas feuerbach who coined the term projection pertaining our inability recognize anything the external world without projecting qualities ourselves upon those karl marx friedrich engels and the british idealists notably green mctaggart and bradley few century philosophers have embraced however quite few have embraced hegelian immanuel copernican also remains important philosophical concept pragmatism pragmatism instrumentalism william james pragmatism was founded the spirit finding scientific concept truth that does not depend personal insight reference some metaphysical the meaning purport statement should judged the effect its acceptance would have truth that opinion which inquiry taken far enough would ultimately for charles sanders peirce these were principles the implied the idea and hope that inquiry not generally the details how these principles should interpreted have been subject discussion since peirce first conceived peirce maxim pragmatism consider what which might conceivably have practical conceive the object our conception then our conception these effects the whole our conception the like postmodern neo pragmatist richard rorty many are convinced that pragmatism asserts that the truth beliefs does not consist their correspondence with but their usefulness and the late century american philosophers charles sanders peirce and william james were its and was later developed john dewey instrumentalism since the usefulness any belief any time might contingent peirce and james conceptualised final truth something only established the final settlement all critics have accused pragmatism falling victim simple because something that true proves that usefulness the basis for its thinkers the pragmatist tradition have included john george santayana quine and lewis pragmatism has more recently been taken new directions richard john lachs donald davidson susan haack and hilary putnam phenomenology phenomenology edmund husserl phenomenology was ambitious attempt lay the foundations for account the structure conscious experience important part phenomenological project was show that all conscious acts are directed about objective feature that husserl called intentionality the first part his volume the logical investigations launched extended attack psychologism the second began develop the technique descriptive phenomenology with the aim showing how objective judgments are grounded conscious however the person experience particular but the properties essential any experiences the kind also attempted identify the essential properties any act developed the method further ideas transcendental phenomenology proposing ground actual and thus all fields human the structure consciousness transcendental ego later attempted reconcile his transcendental standpoint with acknowledgement the intersubjective life world which real individual subjects husserl published only few works his which treat phenomenology mainly abstract methodological but left enormous quantity unpublished concrete husserl work was immediately influential with the foundation phenomenological schools munich and phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work such philosophers martin heidegger formerly research maurice ponty and jean paul sartre through the work heidegger and husserl focus subjective experience influenced aspects existentialism existentialism existentialism existentialism term applied the work number late and century philosophers despite profound doctrinal shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human not merely the thinking but the feeling living human the starting point characterized what has been called the existential sense disorientation and confusion the face apparently meaningless absurd many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic academic both style and too abstract and remote from concrete human ren kierkegaard although they did not use the the century philosophers ren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche are widely regarded the fathers their however has extended beyond existentialist the main target writings was the idealist philosophical system hegel which ignored excluded the inner subjective life living human kierkegaard conversely held that truth arguing that what most important actual human being are questions dealing with inner relationship kierkegaard believed that the truth religious faith was subjective and one wrestled with although kierkegaard and nietzsche were among his the extent which the german philosopher martin heidegger should considered existentialist being and time presented method rooting philosophical explanations human existence dasein analysed terms existential categories existentiale and this has led many commentators treat him important figure the existentialist however the letter humanism heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism jean paul sartre sartre became the known proponent exploring not only theoretical works such being and nothingness but also plays and sartre along with simone beauvoir represented avowedly atheistic branch which now more closely associated with their ideas contingency bad and the absurd than with spiritual nevertheless the focus the individual human responsible before the universe for the authenticity his her common all these structuralism and structuralism structuralism structuralism ferdinand saussure inaugurated the linguist ferdinand saussure structuralism sought clarify systems signs through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make saussure conceived the sign being delimited all the other signs the and ideas being incapable existence prior linguistic which articulates this led continental thought away from and toward what was termed the decentering language longer spoken man express true inner but language speaks structuralism sought the province hard but its positivism soon came under fire wide field some whom were once themselves but later came criticize structuralists believed they could analyze systems from objective for but the poststructuralists argued that this that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis itself determined what while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated crystalline poststructuralists asserted that every attempt grasp the signified results more meaning always state being making ultimate interpretation structuralism came dominate continental philosophy throughout the and early encompassing thinkers diverse claude strauss roland barthes and jacques lacan post structuralism came predominate over the including thinkers such michel foucault jacques derrida gilles deleuze and even roland barthes incorporated critique the analytic tradition analytic philosophy the term analytic philosophy roughly designates group philosophical methods that stress detailed attention use classical logic and classical logics and clarity meaning above all other some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse language because misunderstandings the logic our while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy continuous with michael dummett his origins analytical philosophy makes the case for counting gottlob frege the foundations arithmetic the first analytic the grounds that that book frege took the linguistic analyzing philosophical problems through bertrand russell and moore are also often counted founders analytic beginning with their rejection british their defense realism and the emphasis they laid the legitimacy russell classic works the principles mathematics denoting and principia mathematica with alfred north whitehead aside from greatly promoting the use mathematical logic set the ground for much the research program the early stages the analytic emphasizing such problems the reference proper whether the nature the analysis definite the discussions the foundations well exploring issues ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding the nature mind persistence and which russell tackled often with the aid mathematical russell and the beginning the developed critique hegel and his british followers and grand systems speculative philosophy though means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy hegel see charles taylor nor speculative some schools the group include logical positivism and ordinary language both markedly influenced russell and development logical atomism the former positively and the latter ludwig wittgenstein who studied under russell published his tractatus philosophicus which gave rigidly logical account linguistic and philosophical the understood most the problems philosophy mere puzzles which could solved investigating and then minding the logical structure years reversed number the positions set out the tractatus for example his second major philosophical investigations investigations was influential the development ordinary language which was promoted gilbert ryle austin and few the united meanwhile the philosophy quine was having major with such classics two dogmas empiricism that paper quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic arguing that clear conception analyticity argued for the thesis that including scientific set
