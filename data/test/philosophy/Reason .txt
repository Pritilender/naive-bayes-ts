term was logos the root the modern english word logic but also word which could mean for example speech explanation account money philosophical term logos was translated its linguistic senses latin ratio this was originally not just translation used for but was also commonly translation for logos the sense account french raison derived directly from and this the direct source the english word reason the earliest major philosophers publish such francis bacon thomas hobbes and john locke also routinely wrote latin and and compared their terms treating the words logos ratio raison and reason the meaning the word reason senses such human also overlaps large extent with rationality and the adjective reason philosophical contexts normally rational rather than reasoned reasonable some philosophers such thomas hobbes for also used the word ratiocination synonym for reasoning philosophical history francisco goya the sleep reason produces monsters produce monstruos the proposal that reason gives humanity special position nature has been argued defining characteristic western philosophy and later western modern science starting with classical philosophy can described way life based upon and the other direction reason has been one the major subjects philosophical discussion since ancient reason often said reflexive and the critique reason has been persistent theme has been defined different different different classical philosophy for many classical philosophers nature was understood teleologically meaning that every type thing had definitive purpose which fit within natural order that was itself understood have perhaps starting with pythagoras heraclitus the cosmos even said have reason this not just one characteristic that humans happen and that influences happiness amongst other reason was considered higher stature than other characteristics human such because something humans share with nature linking apparently immortal part the human mind with the divine order the cosmos within the human mind soul psyche reason was described plato being the natural monarch which should rule over the other such spiritedness thumos and the aristotle plato defined human beings rational animals emphasizing reason characteristic human nature defined the highest human happiness well being eudaimonia life which lived excellently and completely accordance with the conclusions drawn from the discussions aristotle and plato this matter are amongst the most debated the history but teleological accounts such were highly influential for those who attempt explain reason way which consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity the human for the neo platonist account plotinus the cosmos has one which the seat all and the souls all individual humans are part this reason for plotinus both the provider form material and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their such platonist accounts the rational part the human soul were standard amongst medieval islamic and under this mainly via averroes came debated seriously europe until well into the renaissance and they remain important iranian philosophy subject centred reason early modern philosophy the early modern era was marked number significant changes the understanding starting europe one the most important these changes involved change the metaphysical understanding human scientists and philosophers began question the teleological understanding the nature was longer assumed with its own aims and human nature was longer assumed work according anything other than the same laws nature which affect inanimate this new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from spiritual understanding the accordingly the ren descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion humans rational suggesting instead that they are nothing more than thinking along the lines other things any grounds knowledge outside that understanding therefore subject his search for foundation all possible descartes deliberately decided throw into doubt all knowledge except that the mind itself the process this time admit nothing that not necessarily therefore precisely nothing but thinking that reason words whose meanings was previously this eventually became known epistemological reason because based the knowing subject who perceives the rest the world and itself set objects and successfully mastered applying the knowledge accumulated through such breaking with tradition and many thinkers after descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into such reason and describing them one indivisible incorporeal contemporary thomas hobbes described reason broader version addition and which not limited this understanding reason sometimes termed calculative reason similar hobbes asserted that discourse can end absolute knowledge past but that sense and absolute the late through the john locke and david hume developed line thought still hume took especially skeptical direction proposing that there could possibility deducing relationships cause and and therefore knowledge based reasoning even seems hume famously remarked speak not strictly and philosophically when talk the combat passion and reason and ought only the slave the and can never pretend any other office than serve and obey hume also took his definition reason unorthodox extremes unlike his that human reason not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual from judgments associating two and that reason nothing but wonderful and unintelligible instinct our which carries along certain train and endows them with particular according their particular situations and followed from this that animals have only much less complex than human the immanuel kant attempted show that hume was wrong demonstrating that transcendental self was necessary condition all therefore suggested the basis such fact possible reason both about the conditions and limits human and long these limits are reason can the vehicle justice and substantive and formal reason the formulation who wrote some the most influential modern treatises the the great achievement reason that able exercise kind universal kant was able therefore formulate the basis theoretical and aesthetic universal laws here practical reasoning the legislating governing formulation universal norms and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws nature under practical the moral autonomy freedom human beings depends their ability behave according laws that are given them the proper exercise that this contrasted with earlier forms which depended religious understanding and nature for their according free society each individual must able pursue their goals however they see long their actions conform principles given formulated such called the categorical imperative which would justify action only could act only according that maxim whereby you the same will that should become universal contrast hume kant insists that reason itself german vernunft has natural ends the solution the metaphysical especially the discovery the foundations kant claimed that this problem could solved with his transcendental logic which unlike normal logic not just which can used was for but theoretical science its own right and the basis all the according rgen habermas the substantive reason has dissolved modern such that can longer answer the question how should instead the unity reason has strictly thus described reason group three autonomous spheres the model three cognitive instrumental reason the kind reason employed the used observe predict and control and intervene the world the basis its moral practical reason what use deliberate and discuss issues the moral and political according universalizable procedures similar categorical and aesthetic reason typically found works art and and encompasses the novel ways seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices for these three spheres are the domain and therefore need mediated with the lifeworld drawing such picture habermas hoped demonstrate that the substantive unity which modern societies had been able answer questions about the good could made for the unity formalizable the critique reason hamann herder kant hegel kierkegaard nietzsche heidegger foucault rorty and many other philosophers have contributed debate about what reason ought some like nietzsche and are skeptical about universal instrumental and even skeptical toward reason others including believe that has obscured the importance intersubjectivity spirit human and attempt reconstruct model what reason should some foucault believe there are other forms neglected but essential modern and our understanding what means live life according the last several number proposals have been made this critique recognize the other new for opposition centred habermas has proposed model communicative reason that sees essentially cooperative based the fact linguistic intersubjectivity nikolas kompridis has proposed widely encompassing view reason that ensemble practices that contributes the opening and preserving human and focus possibilities for social the philosopher charles taylor influenced the century german philosopher martin heidegger has proposed that reason ought include the faculty disclosure which tied the way make sense things everyday new department the essay what michel foucault proposed concept critique based distinction between private and public uses this has two private reason the reason that used when individual cog when one has role play society and jobs have taxes charge civil public reason the reason used when one reasoning reasonable being and not cog when one reasoning member reasonable these the use reason must free and reason compared related concepts reason compared logic logic the terms logic logical are sometimes used they were identical with the term reason with the concept being rational sometimes logic seen the most pure the defining form for example modern economics rational choice assumed equate logically consistent choice reason and logic can however thought although logic one important aspect author douglas hofstadter escher bach characterizes the distinction this logic done inside system while reason done outside the system such methods skipping working drawing looking seeing what happens you change the rules the reason type thought and the word logic involves the attempt describe rules norms which reasoning that orderly reasoning can the oldest surviving writing explicitly consider the rules which reason operates are the works the greek philosopher aristotle especially prior analysis and posterior analysis although the ancient greeks had separate word for logic distinct from language and aristotle newly coined word syllogism syllogismos identified logic clearly for the first time distinct field when aristotle referred the logik was referring more broadly rational reason compared effect and symbolic thinking causality symbols pointed out philosophers such locke and some animals are also clearly capable type associative thinking even the extent associating causes and dog once can learn how recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked the but this does not mean the dog has reason any strict sense the also does not mean that humans acting the basis experience habit are using their human reason requires more than being able associate two even those two ideas might described reasoning human cause and perceptions for and memories for reason the association smoke and the fire would have thought through way which can for example cause and the explanation locke for reason requires the mental use third idea order make this comparison use syllogism more reason the strict sense requires the ability create and manipulate system symbols well indices and icons according charles sanders peirce the symbols having only though connection either smoke one example such system artificial symbols and signs language the connection reason symbolic thinking has been expressed different ways thomas hobbes described the creation notes leviathan speech used the word speech english version the greek word logos that speech did not need when such speech becomes and the marks notes remembrance are called signes going further although aristotle source the idea that only humans have reason logos does mention that animals with for whom sense perceptions can come closest having something like reasoning and nous and even uses the word logos one place describe the distinctions which animals can perceive such reason imagination mimesis and memory imagination mimesis memory recollection reason and imagination rely similar mental processes imagination not only found aristotle for stated that phantasia that which can hold images phantasmata and phronein type thinking that can judge and understand some also exist some according both are related the primary perceptive ability which gathers the perceptions different senses and defines the order the things that are perceived without distinguishing and without deliberation logos but this not yet because human imagination the recent modern writings terrence deacon and merlin donald writing about the origin language also connect reason connected not only language but also mimesis more specifically they describe the ability create language part internal modeling reality specific other results are consciousness and imagination fantasy modern proponents genetic disposition language itself include noam chomsky and steven pinker whom donald and deacon can reason symbolic and peculiarly then this implies that humans have special ability maintain clear consciousness the distinctness icons images and the real things they starting with modern merlin donald writes dog might perceive the meaning fight that was realistically acted but could not reconstruct the message distinguish the representation from its referent real trained apes are able make this young children make this distinction early hence their effortless distinction between acting event and the event itself classical equivalent description this mental faculty eikasia the philosophy this the ability perceive whether perception image something related somehow but not the and therefore allows humans perceive that dream memory reflection mirror not reality what klein refers dianoetic eikasia the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental such those mental icons signes and marks discussed above definitive explaining reason from this human thinking special the way that often understand visible things they were themselves images our intelligible objects foundations hypoth ses ancient this thinking dianoia activity which consists making the vast and diffuse jungle the visible world depend plurality more both merlin donald and the socratic authors such plato and aristotle emphasize the importance mimesis often translated imitation representation donald writes imitation found especially monkeys and apes but mimesis fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry that involves the invention intentional mimesis not absolutely tied external mim sis now popular again academic that was particularly prevalent and within discussed mainly the poetics michael account the theory man this the distinctive feature human that whenever choose what imagine action for ourselves though were inspecting from the intentions are nothing more than imagined internalizings the all action therefore imitation donald like plato and especially memory and recollection emphasizes the peculiarity humans voluntary initiation search through mental the ancient greek anamn sis normally translated recollection was opposed mneme memory memory shared with some requires consciousness not only what happened the but also that something happened the which other words kind eikasia but nothing except man able recollection deliberate effort search for and recapture something once klein writes become aware our having forgotten something means begin donald calls the same thing autocueing which explains mimetic acts are reproducible the basis self generated this permits voluntary recall mimetic without the aid external cues probably the earliest form representational thinking celebrated paper modern the fantasy author and philologist tolkien wrote his essay fairy that the terms fantasy and enchantment are connected not only the satisfaction certain primordial human but also the origin language and the logical reasoning methods and argumentation looking logical categorizations different types reasoning the traditional main division made philosophy between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning formal logic has been described the science deduction the study inductive reasoning generally carried out within the field known informal logic critical thinking deductive reasoning deductive reasoning subdivision philosophy logic logic the study deduction form reasoning which conclusion follows necessarily from the stated deduction generally inference reasoning from the general the deduction also the conclusion reached deductive reasoning one classic example deductive reasoning that found syllogisms like the the reasoning this argument because there way which the and could true and the inductive reasoning inductive reasoning induction form inference producing propositions about unobserved objects either specifically based previous used ascribe properties relations objects types based previous observations experiences formulate general statements laws based limited observations recurring phenomenal patterns inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning even the cases inductive the truth the premises does not guarantee the truth the instead the conclusion inductive argument follows with some degree probability relatedly the conclusion inductive argument contains more information than already contained the thus this method reasoning classic example inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist david hume abductive reasoning abductive reasoning abductive reasoning argument the best form inductive since the conclusion abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something what distinguishes abduction from the other forms reasoning attempt favour one conclusion above attempting falsify alternative explanations demonstrating the likelihood the favoured given set more less disputable for when patient displays certain there might various possible but one these preferred above others being more analogical reasoning analogical reasoning analogical reasoning reasoning from the particular the example analogical reasoning can viewed form inductive reasoning dubious discuss since the truth the premises does not guarantee the truth the however the traditional view that inductive reasoning reasoning from the particular the and thus analogical reasoning distinct from inductive fallacious reasoning fallacy formal fallacy informal fallacy flawed reasoning arguments known fallacious reasoning bad reasoning within arguments can because commits either formal fallacy informal fallacy formal fallacies occur when there problem with the the the word formal refers this link the form the argument that contains formal fallacy will always consider for the following drink made with will this drink was not made with this drink not informal fallacy error reasoning that occurs due problem with the content rather than mere structure the traditional problems raised concerning reason philosophy sometimes described life with normal human reason pursued more consistent and dedicated way than two categories problem concerning reason have long been discussed philosophers concerning essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself human philosophizing about the first question concerning whether can confident that reason can achieve knowledge truth better than other ways trying achieve such the other question whether life life that aims guided can expected achieve happy life more than other ways life whether such life reason results knowledge reason versus and first truth first principle nous since classical times question has remained constant philosophical debate which sometimes seen conflict between movements called platonism and aristotelianism concerning the role reason confirming truth people use deduction and induction reach conclusions they think are conclusions reached this way are considered more certain than sense perceptions their the other such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon foundation sense then our most logical conclusions can never said certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek this leads the question what types first principles starting points are available for someone seeking come true first principles are archai starting and the faculty used perceive them sometimes referred aristotle and plato nous which was close meaning awareness consciousness empiricism sometimes associated with aristotle but more correctly associated with british philosophers such john locke and david hume well their ancient equivalents such democritus asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting attain this approach always leads the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge not idealism associated with plato and his claims that there higher reality from which certain people can directly arrive truth without needing rely only upon the and that this higher reality therefore the primary source philosophers such plato aristotle farabi avicenna averroes maimonides aquinas and hegel are sometimes said have argued that reason must fixed and perhaps analysis the vision these reason divine least has divine such approach allowed religious philosophers such thomas aquinas and tienne gilson try show that reason and revelation are according the only thought which philosophy brings with the contemplation history the simple conception that reason the sovereign the that the history the therefore presents with rational since the century rationalists reason has often been taken subjective faculty rather the unaided ability pure reason form for descartes spinoza and leibniz this was associated with mathematics kant attempted show that pure reason could form concepts time and space that are the conditions kant made his argument opposition who denied that reason had any role play reason versus emotion passion emotion passion after plato and western literature often treated reason being opposed emotions feelings this was understanding human nature for stoic philosophy roman people might say their passions made them behave contrary that their reason kept the passions under this often expressed colloquially the dilemma between following the head the heart reason has been seen the notably the work david hume and more recently freud reasoning which claims that the object desire demanded logic alone called rationalization rousseau first his second discourse that reason and political life not natural and possibly harmful asked what really can said about what natural what other than reason and civil best suits his rousseau saw two principles prior human first hold intense interest our own secondly object the suffering death any sentient especially one like these two passions lead desire more than could become dependent upon each and relationships authority and this effectively puts the human race into rousseau says that almost dares assert that nature does not destine men according rousseau outlines certain programs rational most notably the political legislation the contrat social and the moral education mile all the rousseau understands such corrections only ameliorations essentially unsatisfactory that socially and intellectually corrupted this quandary presented rousseau led kant new way justifying reason freedom create good and these therefore are not blamed nature various german idealism after and major later figures such nietzsche bergson husserl scheler and heidegger remain occupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands urges reason the influence rousseau and these later writers also large upon art and many writers such nikos kazantzakis extol passion and disparage politics modern nationalism comes from argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural reason versus faith tradition faith religion tradition evaluative diversity though theologies and religions typically not claim irrational there often perceived conflict tension between faith and tradition the one and reason the potentially competing sources wisdom law and truth defenders traditions and faiths from claims that they are irrationalist for ignoring even attempting forbid reason and argument concerning some typically maintain that there real conflict with because reason itself not enough explain such things the origins the right and and reason can and should complemented other sources knowledge other words first principles the counter claim this that such defense does not logically explain why some arguments from reason would forbidden while others are which tends property all religion and traditional citation needed there are enormously wide differences between different even schools within different concerning this some commentators have claimed that western civilization can almost defined its serious testing the limits tension between unaided reason and faith revealed truths figuratively summarized athens and jerusalem respectively leo strauss spoke greater west that included all areas under the influence the tension between greek rationalism and abrahamic revelation including the muslim lands was particularly influenced the great muslim philosopher farabi consider what extent eastern philosophy might have partaken these important strauss thought best consider whether dharma tao may equivalent nature which mean physis according strauss the beginning philosophy involved the discovery invention and the philosophical equivalent was supplied such notions ways which appear really universal all times and places the philosophical concept nature natures way understanding archai first principles brought about peculiar tension between reasoning the one and tradition faith the although there this special history debate concerning reason and faith the christian and jewish the pursuit reason sometimes argued compatible with the other practice other religions different such hinduism because they not define their tenets such absolute reason particular fields study reason political philosophy and ethics political philosophy ethics the good aristotle famously described reason with part human nature which means that best for humans live politically meaning communities about the size and type small city state polis for then that human being more political politikon the polis animal ion than any bee than any those animals that live for makes nothing and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech logos voice serves indicate what painful and that why also found other because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what painful and pleasant and express these each but speech logos serves make plain what advantageous and harmful and also what just and for peculiarity contrast the other have perception good and just and and the and the community these things makes household city polis then the drive for such community exists but the first set one responsible for things very great for humans are the best all animals when they are the worst when divorced from law and the reason that injustice most difficult deal with when furnished with and the weapons human being has are meant nature along with prudence and but only too possible turn them contrary consequently human being lacks the most unholy and savage and when comes sex and the but justice something political with the polis for right the arrangement the political and right discrimination what aristotle politics peter with greek terms inserted square the concept human nature being fixed this implied other that can define what type community always best for this argument has remained central argument all ethical and moral thinking since and has become especially controversial since firstly rousseau second and the theory evolution already aristotle there was awareness that the polis had not always existed and had needed invented developed humans the household came and the first villages and cities were just extensions with the first cities being run they were still families with kings acting like friendship philia seems prevail man and woman

this kind nicomachean ethics viii rough literal translation with greek terms shown square rousseau his second discourse finally took the shocking step claiming that this traditional account has things with language and rationally organized communities all having developed over long period time merely result the fact that some habits cooperation were found solve certain types and that once such cooperation became more forced people develop increasingly complex often only defend themselves from each other according reason language and rational community did not arise because any conscious decision plan humans nor because any existing human living together rationally organized communities like modern humans development with many negative aspects compared the original state man anything specifically human this the flexibility and adaptability this view the animal origins distinctive human characteristics later received support from charles darwin theory evolution the two competing theories concerning the origins reason are relevant political and ethical thought according the aristotelian best way living together exists independently historical according should even doubt that language and politics are good opposed being simply the best option given the particular course events that lead rousseau that human nature malleable rather than often taken for example karl marx

his colleague hugo describes the idea that there could have been other forces driving the evolution sperber points out that reasoning very difficult for humans and that hard for individuals doubt their own reasoning most effective when done collective demonstrated the success projects like science sperber says this could suggest that there are not just but group selection pressures any group that managed find ways reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its increasing their fitness this could also help explain why according are not optimized reason effectively patricia writing
