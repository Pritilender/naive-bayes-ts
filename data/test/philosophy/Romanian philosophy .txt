panayotou govdelas some them were alumni the academies from the who studied with himself ancient student the princely academy from daniel philippidis also studied this academy the under the famous philologist neophyte cavsocalyvitis but they had studied also with the exception major western doungas for was student friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling his physics tried reconcile the dogmatic orthodox theology with the science following they were not only proponents modern philosophy and natural but also enlightenment the philosophy the french philosophes had thus major impact the romanian intelligentsia through their courses and published philosophically the most interesting these authors beniamin whose metaphysics contains among other valuable theory perception involving the

universities pisa and paris eufrosin poteca taught philosophy the saint sava and was prolific translator philosophical and theological his own philosophy was strongly influenced the sensualism condillac tracy and rousseau political philosophy and his strong christian maintained that there are three metaphysical first body soul and studied three distinct physics the study unanimated psychology the study animated and ideology the sense the science the whole universe displays this triadic permeated life and identified the laws nature with the laws and drew from this conception many moral the lack foundation also thought that the foundation all politics and rights the golden from here argued against and that got him exiled remote where lived until the end his another important name that ionic utul moldavian was educated home some french acquiring extensive knowledge political indeed quotes rousseau montesquieu voltaire but also obscure writers such sabatier his ideas are disseminated mostly his correspondence and political but left also some interesting like construction politics according human nature essay against deists and materialists his intention was build political theory starting from christian anthropology the state the political system justified such procedure was democratic the second whose title obviously inspired mersenne criticises the materialist vision the machine mettrie the bases rather paulinic doctrine the amphibian character character which clearly distinguishes him from the natural important philosopher also alexandru jdeu student friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling this although very proud his moldavian was ardent russian since lived bessarabia moldavian territory annexed his philosophy concerned with the destiny and slavophile and argues for the development purely russian emerging from the careful study the russian according only such philosophy can only this way the russian element can brought the way arrive such philosophy continue the thinking skovoroda the only authentic russian philosopher this will fulfil the moment existence for itself the russian ioan zalomit studied the philosophy france and with victor cousin and friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling obtained here the title doctor philosophy with thesis kant his inaugural dissertation zalomit tries overcome the kantian opposition between laws

neophyte and from migrated the romanian classes gheorghe after the death lazar became teacher the academy and had prodigious activity cultural published almost his romanian grammar influenced condillac which knew from his greek after the turmoil the revolution heliade dulescu comes with philosophical inspired from kabala and the socialism proudhon and fourier there are also traces hegel but not directly read knew him probably from the works his two most important works are the universal critical history and equilibrium between antitheses heliade dulescu against monisms and dualisms all trinitarian affirms that all philosophical concepts come which can classified two sympathetic and sympathetic duality formed two positive terms which indicate time space spirit matter right duty antipathetic duality contains positive and negative life death movement inertia good evil now each sympathetic duality produces third through which the dualism here are some spirit matter universe form substance body progress conservation perfectibility spiritual man physical man moral beginning from heliade dulescu develops kind means although ingenious geometrical means thus offer metaphysical explanation progress and armed with this fight the for his final purpose offer argument support his political called progressive those who reply that this inconsistent answers that the duality progress conservation not but and that only progressive conservatism the epoch charles carol and prince alexandru ioan cuza founds the universities and and karl von sigmaringen under the name carol domnitor the principality romania which will later become the kingdom romania this event marks new wave well reaction against the formerly prevalent cultural that almost the same the junimnea literary society founded the last thirty years the century are culturally dominated the junimea the romanian philosophy will have new beginning for the first international the philosophers from junimea were titu maiorescu vasile conta alexandru xenopol mihai eminescu constantin leonardescu ioan pop florantin titu maiorescu studied the philosophy and obtained his two doctorates from the university giessen and later from the university his first philosophical paper was einiges philosophische gemeinfasslicher form work that was rather well written under the influence herbart and his most important contribution was logic influenced herbart who had numerous reprints and served textbook until the years was proponent and was skeptical with respect the possibility creative romanian vasile conta obtained his doctorate from the university bruxelles and functioned professor law the university his published romanian and included orie fatalisme and orie ondulation universelle conta

from his constant preoccupations with his most famous orie xenopol presents philosophy science the utmost importance and draws distinction between facts and facts the facts repetition are studied the natural and are characterised natural the facts succession are studied the sciences the notably and they are not subsumed any but they form xenopol was considered rickert one his also discussed the concept the notion hypothesis and the verification his views space and time oppose kantian and argues explicitly against the german who his opinion had turned history into mere fairy mihai the romanian national studied philosophy viena and apparently was preparing thesis the philosophy but never got his the author the first romanian translation the critique pure reason many his poems and prose appropriate literary quite few philosophical mainly influenced kant schopenhauer and buddhism but never wrote philosophical texts the other hand his political exposed newspaper articles and editorials quite eminescu one the most important and influential romanian conservative political thinkers the last decades the constantin leonardescu studied the universities bucharest and and was professor philosophy the university generally was influenced the french eclecticism and had thoroughly scientific attitude like many his leonardescu had great interested science which tried apply diverse domains such epistemology and his long list published books includes philosophy face the progress positive sciences metaphysics religion and science the principles psychology the inductive morals the science the human behaviour etc ioan pop doctor philosophy the university vienna taught philosophy several schools authored several books psychology and general well the first romania treatise aesthetics advanced also personal conception called the universal kind materialistic process from this position summoned the true the tribunal towards the end his prince grigore sturdza was learned who had philosophical published some philosophical works among which les lois fondamentales univers the most the matter chiefly the the scientific which eventually serves basis for metaphysical outside the borders the later can notice the activity vasile lucaciu from northern part catholic studied rome where obtained his doctorate theology and the author thomist philosophical institutions philosophy published between and three logic metaphysics and moral philosophy century during the the history romanian philosophy can divided three the communist the communist and the communist pre communist period two major schools philosophy have the first half the two peaks romanian the school and the school nae ionescu transylvanian philosophers can also grouped mostly reason their non affiliation the two other but also the reason their belonging the same spiritual apart this three schools there are many other cultivating with predilection the philosophical special mention deserve the members the onicescu aptly characterised analytic the maiorescians the maiorescians are constantin motru negulescu dumitru draghicescu ion petrovici and mircea florian constantin the grandson eufrosin poteca called his philosophical system energetic influenced the energetism and expert experimental psychology studied under getting his doctorate with dissertation followed the inductivist trend the human personality was considered him superior form the final stage the evolution the his metaphysics implies political program well ethics the purpose the political life must the transition from the anarchic that governed the romanian society energetic negulescu published philosophy the renaissance still readable and capital study the philosophy called the genesis the forms the culture dumitru draghicescu obtained his licence philosophy with memoir the influence kant auguste compte the university bucharest continuing his studies where did his doctorate with durkheim his youth was under the influence materialist draghicescu had major contributions social philosophy was also important one vers une nouvelle dieu volumes was wery well received charles hartshorne for the authentically new aspects the concept god which put draghicescu considered that man the being the limit whose development saying that all attributes can applied such considered his potentiality and historical ion petrovici wrote logic and logic contributed the logical theory mainly regarding the relations between the intension and the extension contradicted the law their inverse metaphysics perhaps the most well known his contributions the lecture the idea which the nothingness was determined transcendent preceding existence and transcending but manifesting itself immanently the existent mircea who studied germany with the neokantian elaborated between the wars philosophy the pure trying overcome the epistemology based the object his results are published the volume philosophical reconstruction the ionescians the ionescians grouped around their teacher nae ionescu earned his phd with study logistic the terminology the mathematical actually rejected mathematical thinking reductive even comparison classical his thinking logic general may regarded form published only newspaper where held strongly reactionary and quickly moved toward the extreme after his some his students and associates amz eliade onicescu vulc published his various lectures history epistemology theory and metaphysics and the history his approach the history philosophy mostly not nae thought could described overall existential philosophy christian called from the verb autochthonous version existentialism influenced vitalism and orthodox many late commentators have accused him plagiarism neglecting that never wrote his not even lecture ionescu creatively and many occasions one can recognise ideas initiated scheler heidegger his charisma was and students were completely captivated the fact that philosophised the the course without giving interesting answers issues they and provoking certain spiritual with impetus toward thinking because was quite always disposed toward revising his thought and never wrote philosophy his disciples compared him the most important his adherents were mircea vulcanescu mircea eliade emil cioran constantin noica others like petre were also influenced his and philosophers like alexandru dragomir and mihai ora attended some his mircea vulcanescu had enormous being considered many the chief the generation but did not publish significant philosophical however influence romanian philosophy with his seminal essay the romanian dimension existence this work analyses the conceptual paradigm that serves means evaluation diverse philosophical visions analysing certain romanian what calls phenomenological claims unravel the inherent for from analysis the linguistic particularities negation the romanian deduces the romanian with traits like fatalism indifference regarding easygoing attitude toward the conception that there alternative but also nothing mircea the known scholar the history published few essays showing the influence his teacher but through these early works brought nothing essentially new the landscape the romanian however very important person the intellectual landscape the another possible leader new emil his early books written proposed philosophy shows morbid obsession with all expressed deeply lyrical wrote mostly nihilist themes nietzschean and schopeanhaurean with some contemporary influences like giovanni papini and nicolai constantin noica debuted with essay called mathesis simple joys the short book glosses the distinction between life and after this essay noica will orientate himself towards the history writing kant leibniz descartes plato aristotle hume etc his phd thesis was called sketch for the history how something new may possible where tries answer how the spirit not endlessly analysing european philosophy from plato the transylvanians transylvania produced between the wars three remarkable lucian blaga rosca and eugeniu sperantia lucian philosophical called ekstatic highly original with roots the philosophy psychoanalysis and patristic philosophy the system was projected five monumental trilogies but only three were achieved and fourth was partially the trilogies the trilogy knowledge the trilogy culture the trilogy values and the cosmological trilogy the metaphysical vision blaga centres around mysterious metaphysical source principle called the great which creates the universe mutilating the forms existence that emanate from order avoid the possibility the apparition another great the results these acts mutilation are infinitesimal structured and called divine the extant beings appear the aggregation these the speculative cosmology blaga also includes entelechial interpretation evolutionist his theory knowledge asserts the existence unconscious endowed with his own set categories which double the kantian categories the conscious these categories the unconscious prevent humans from completely revealing the mystery since all his knowledge must fit into this categorical thus the great anonymous maintains isolated centrality because complete knowledge would make the man but also infuses human activity with creative blaga metaphysical axiology also follows this all categories encompass human powers and their dynamic influence finally projected into other what can not this finalist repetitively ensures the creative destiny all human culture according blaga the result trying reveal the mysteries constitutes the since man can not reveal completely the because the transcendent exerted the unconscious categorial all his productions bear the mark this dynamic the totality these categories some point called stylistic and they have the structure cosmoid that small sufficient thus each culture characterised which different categories activate and wear off until the complete exhaustion the stylistic that the culture generated the attempts revelation within the respective stylistic matrix this vision inspired but significantly detached from the morphological theory exposed frobenius spengler blaga discusses with many illustrations why all these theories missed the rosca who would later the coordinator and translator the series complete works hegel into arrived philosophical synthesis presented his book the tragic existence personal blend existentialism with roots kierkegaard but influenced also his phd thesis the sorbonne the influence hegel taine well his translation french the life jesus made him known name the speaking eugeniu sperantia was very prolific began his list publications with his phd the pragmatic apriorism rethinking transcendental analytic from pragmatist stand wrote subsequently various like the biology from hegelian perspective gaining reputation especially the field the philosophy was pioneer the field erotetic logic the logic which called problematology very interesting and most neglected work his system implicit the postulates any possible knowledge have here theoretical innovation sperantia replaces the categorial theories classical metaphysics with the analysis the most general analysis rendered possible his thus the theory metaphysics becomes the logic the recently his conception metaphysics was compared that collingwood other philosophers from the multitude philosophical authors unaffiliated the previous three currents can mention here almost vasile ionel gherea anton dumitriu and phane lupasco vasile wrote two important commentaries blaga and radulescu motru and gave valuable reply mioritic space also called plai opposing what called the space gan blaga book maintained that the unconscious category space which operates the romanian stylistic matrix was the space indefinitely alternation ups and the name mioritical comes from diminutive the famous title popular ballad that widely considered quite relevant the romanian written peculiar alternating these are highly metaphorical and playful descriptions specific ethos common significant cultural regions loosely related geographical blaga also contends one may live plain but reflect mioritic ethos and that specific ethos may become dominant even while remains minor the term not loaded with value and this style may absorb others while also being influenced bancil the other hand tried show that romanian culture whole does not reflect only single abysmal category the plai structure pointed out and subsequently tried show the existence gan gan the name the greatest plain space not determined the alternating relief hills but the flat ionel son the noted marxist sociologist constantin gherea published book called the and the essay anthropomorphic cosmogony this much too neglected work contains still interesting discussion the concept personal the author does unusual amount conceptual

beyond matter and the the mathematician octav onicescu conducted seminar philosophy science the university among the most important members this group scientific philosophy were fellow mathematicians grigore moisil and dan barbilian well other notorious scientists like erban eica nicholas roegen they were engaged foundational using mathematics formal instrument conceptual their results were published the antology the problem determinism some monographs principles scientific knowledge georgescu the statistical method sergescu mathematical thinking communist period within the first decade romanian philosophical life was dominated the persecution all important interbellum lucretiu patrascanu was the author currents and tendencies romanian philosophy which will establish for decades the status the romanian with mostly rudimentary over appealing the doctrine patrascanu polemicized with major philosophers radulescu florian cioran and exposed them irrationalists mystics bourgeois imperialists and sometimes among the local marxists new star emerged constantin gulian member the romanian academy since until his gulian produced the peak his career several expositions hegelian completely lacking any during these first philosophy was taught universities dentists illiterate workers turned into professors virtually following hardcore communist dogma slowly lost some its after the date the great amnesty all political philosophical life had chance come back into partly catalysed the professional reinsertion the relatively few surviving who were either imprisoned thus can distinguish several schools the interbellum the school and the epistemological school independent figures mostly university the interbellum school the name school may even more inappropriate this case than was when spoke nae ionescu school that titu maiorescu the interbellum school should seen the same manner speak the old the most important philosophers formed the interbellum that could practice again and remained significantly creative mircea florian constantin noica anton dumitriu mihai ora petre alexandru dragomir mircea florian wrote the solitude system philosophy presented volume treatise called recessivity the structure the world inspired analogy with genetic florian arrives the conclusion that experience characterised the relation recessivity that holds between two this relation neither relation like the nor one like the special relation which exhibits features both types notional relation acknowledged both relation and relation pair concepts united this there one which hierarchically called the dominant concept and another although hierarchically ontologically superior called the recessive concept florian shows that every important concept philosophy belongs pair which instantiates analysed several dozens such writing for each term practically constantin noica became during this after his release from continental metaphysician european arguably one the greatest the late his first book published after detention was steps the real which unifies three categorial those aristotle and under but maybe also influenced nicolai thought that divided three inorganic organic and characterised three distinct sets the peak this categorial ladder put new which reflects the impact that physics had his the the which became thus the supreme later developed the theory initiated vulc nescu and wrote several books which brought him overnight especially literary books creation and beauty romanian speech the romanian sentiment being masterpieces etymological speculation and philosophical hermeneutics have obviously limited universal interest only those researching romanian spirituality per these books noica arrived the conclusion that the romanian language possesses which mediates its unique access the realm the preposition ntru which expresses the processuality the being what calls the becoming towards being this idiomatic latin provenance intro stands for more than spatial indicates going movement both toward and within that something movement his ontology more correctly called edified without the idiomatic peculiarities two later and consists the becoming the being and letters the logic hermes but was incipient since six maladies the contemporary spirit these works noica shows how the monolithic unity being and being displays three the being first instance arrived the being things appears functional the structure individual determinations general which the things are striving but the model the being rarely found realised like most currently only two the three terms being thus there are six unsaturated called noica ontological maladies the six these schematically represented and are what calls the rule the then the being second instance the element characterised which entity that not its conditions identity not make reference single temporal something general distributes itself without like the whiteheadian the distribution without rethinking the platonic favourite exemplification the nature element for noica the concept biological the elements are characterised different categories than the speculative like reality the being the third the being qua theorised several pages incredible and language close noica attempts rethink here the problem the one and the parmenidean platonic formulates criterion for being the same distribution without methodologically noica can paradoxically hegelian revises hegelian accused explicitly noica being dominated the ethos hegelian noica hegel himself must intervene order give the concepts the necessary impetus for their they not have themselves the power move noica considers that dialectics circular and the scheme thesis antithesis synthesis replaced him with the rival scheme theme anti theme thesis theme the noica begins not with but with thematic horizon which and into which digs going more and more toward the intimacy this several peculiar paradoxical which allow him articulate his views are difficult and require much sympathy from the the limiting the opening etc noica philosophy also concerned with the problem reason and the problem the redefines reason the conscience the becoming the philosopher wanted save the individual from the tyranny the give the individual ontological was deeply disturbed the image the individual simple instance something simple particular case general but also intended maintain the reality the general not wanting reduce them mere collections classes thus rejected both platonic realism and nominalism all instead choosing between nominalism and proposes third which insists the solidarity existent between the individual and the linked their his triangle forms thus irreducible reminiscent peirce constantin noica formed around him unofficial school based mountain location where spent his last living became place pilgrimage for young romanian who went there search spiritual noica became thus kind national institution with influence unequalled any other intellectual figure before after imposed his disciples the intensive study greek and and asked them approach cultures not authors and certainly not isolated had effervescent activity initiating collaboration with petru the integral edition plato also translated from platonic aristotelian dexippus ammonius porphyry and contributed the translation critique judgement and translated from the introduction logic and the commentary metaphysics himself wrote commentaries and interpretations aristotle and and encouraged the introduction heidegger was far the most brilliant philosopher war anton dumitriu continued after his initial publishing the philosophy mathematics and the theory and history his monumental history logic although landmark romanian philosophy and the suffered from notable shortcomings and had rather bad reception the dumitriu included too much some topics his with chapters the transcendental and dialectical and too little not treating many branches recent treating them completely sketchily and the case modal also was misinformed issues concerning scholastic however there are many parts this work that are still valuable anton dumitriu wrote also series more literary which made him appreciated the romanian intellectual centered his book philosophia mirabilis essay the esoteric dimension the greek eleatic cultures and heracleitean cultures comparative essay the philosophy and aletheia study the greek meaning truth and where criticises heidegger position introduction metaphysics mihai ora was student nae ionescu and mircea eliade but younger than the members the called generation obtained bourse the sorbonne where went for preparing thesis pascal during war time wrote book called the interior dialogue published only gallimard and well received jacques maritain and tienne gilson this work sora explores the problem human existential but influenced greatly scholastic philosophy notably that thomas aquinas and nicolaus cusanus and marxism was member the french communist party and member the returned and leave the country did not publish anything until the end the when began

his last book called the instant and the time his system consists ethics and political all deriving from original ontological the influences comes from guy pascal the scholastics and from husserl sora considered himself ever since his first book cartesian the utmost his concept crucial for the comprehension his was neither that brentano nor that but original one with deep roots the scholastic derived from aliud tendere the penetrating act the which goes beyond the things into their which the unum with his three bonum verum and pulchrum thus there are three forms moral theoretical and characterising three types human attitudes toward the the unum not viewed only actus but rather universal potentiality metaphorical the centre sphere null which thus the same topos the the surface this sphere represents the pure composed terminal the radius the geometrical locus the where find the intermediary mihai ora considered the mentor another school much more discrete and heterogeneous than the school and there currently increasing interest his especially from the young philosophers grouped around the studia phaenomonologica philosophical petre had phd administrative before and during the second world war worked director the ministry national and was known and appreciated all members the generation one their even though was little widely gained the reputation rhetorical when spoke everybody stood and some even considered him leader his initially having youthful marxist developed wing nationalist that would later lead his arrest and prison rediscovered and after his release considered himself christian although due his political antecedents and uncompromising content philosophical ideas and religious faith could not publish very wrote considerable including late work projected five systems styles sciences and finally dogmas completed the first and small part styles and dogmas which the first two volumes were published the philosophy also important veritable manifesto for new dating back was influenced whole plethora intellectual but mostly greek leibniz nietzsche bergson simmel and the fictionalism hans vaihinger the only significant romanian philosophical influences were lucian blaga and nae ionescu theologically was under the sway paul augustine and later thomas aquinas while also knew and admired the major contemporary romanian dumitru niloae whom met also appreciated various thinkers like werner sombart and frequently refers scientists like heisenberg and initially rejected the categories western replacing the kantian conceptual framework with spectrum phenomenological his later effort theologal not thinking argues that truth but human reason cannot find although can receptacle thus order really know the man needs inspiration and man never and all intellectual efforts like science philosophy are only means producing the level material and cultural believed that science and philosophy themselves even have consoling being essentially irrelevant with respect the most dramatic like thus only religion christianity possesses the truth and bears relevance the destiny without man just rational animal that comes from nowhere and anthropologically analyzed what calls christian the anthropological model pursued that the was undoubtedly socratic the sense exemplary and his writing style quite his various writings are hardly and even though never finished whatever after his release from prison elaborated least three original philosophical the philosophy theatre seminar and theologal one singular the called substantivization related his manner writing sentences without well the many resonant repetitions calls and constant nuancing coupled with rejection systems and the absence philosophical speculation stuns most who have idea what make this unusual manner thinking and cultural environment mostly dominated belletristic writing academic the romanian public came know his personality only after when several interviews who was years old were broadcast and gained the admiration broad the subsequent publication collection aphorisms gathered from interviews became best while his major writings are still not very well known although was always surrounded friends who typed and multiplied his neighbours usually called him professor because always seemed but ironically pointed his legendary tenured chair was under the blue the campus migiu central park very close his studio several his close friends and companions such mircea eliade emil cioran petre pandrea later marcel aurel munteanu and from the younger generation radu preda and alexandru popescu are also accomplished writers and alexandru dragomir late discovery the romanian actively promoted the humanitas publishing house led gabriel which edited some his dragomir former doctoral student heidegger was reticent man who wrote secretly and never intended publish his old days began giving private which carried until his only very narrow group intellectuals after died several loosely thematic notebooks were proving that dragomir was phenomenologist great among these whose publication not there are several with reflections which form the most consistent part his the influence dragomir romanian philosophy still studia phaenomenologica whose thematic issues usually feature translations philosophy dedicated one its issues the school paltinis constantin noica was continuous search for the gifted young which discovered and among these that young there are several which have manifested themselves the philosophical and rather philosophical romanian such are gabriel liiceanu andrei sorin vieru andrei cornea vasile zamfirescu alexandru surdu and corneliu mircea gabriel liiceanu grew prominence after published the diary where described his paideic adventure under was also the book that transformed noica into sort philosophical the diary perhaps the most influent romanian philosophical publication the late initiating fascination younger generations with and encouraging the study ancient latin and german prerequisites for the serious study liiceanu own philosophical project initially centered around the idea limit and therefore called his hermeneutic inquiry into the nature and history this concept peratology from the greek peras limit this program initiated with the phenomenology limit and overcoming his phd where lays much accent nietzsche and accomplished with limit the final and more general expression his limit touches various topics such destiny responsibility encounter with the framework basically heideggerian liiceanu also accomplished the translation heidegger into andrei was first known art but also subtle avows being more interested the light side had respectful towards and considered that had absolutely use for oriented himself toward ethics and the philosophy his focal idea that the interval the between space plesu wrote one the very few romanian treatises minima moralia which subtitled ethics the begins affirming that only the man the condition itinerancy has moral needing make choices every step the thus true ethics not major one the great problems and but minor ethics the quotidian life and ordinary further explored the theme the interval his angels book arising the intersection between metaphysics and the philosophy this the entities called angels are analysed cases beings the the entire exercise has thus the secondary value ontology the sorin vieru one the few logicians established his reputation his researches the classical which was also specialist frege
