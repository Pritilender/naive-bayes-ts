modern thales predicted the solar eclipse may diogenes rtius quotes the chronicle apollodorus athens saying that thales died the age the olympiad diogenes rtius states that according herodotus and

fathered son cybisthus cybisthon adopted his nephew the same the second that never telling his mother young man that was too early and older man that was too plutarch had earlier told this solon visited thales and asked him why remained thales answered that did not like the idea having worry about nevertheless several years anxious for adopted his nephew thales involved himself many taking the role some say that left others say that wrote the solstice and the equinox writing attributed him has diogenes rtius quotes two letters from one pherecydes syros offering review his book and one solon offering keep him company his sojourn from athens thales identifies the milesians athenian colonists business capernaum israel several anecdotes suggest that thales was not solely thinker but was also involved business and one story recounts that bought all the olive presses miletus after predicting the weather and good harvest for particular another version the same aristotle explains that thales reserved presses ahead time discount only rent them out high price when demand following his predictions particularly good this first version the story would constitute the first creation and use futures whereas the second version would the first creation and use options aristotle explains that objective doing this was not enrich himself but prove his fellow milesians that philosophy could contrary what they politics thales political life had mainly with the involvement the ionians the defense anatolia against the growing power the persians who were then new the king had come power neighboring lydia croesus who was somewhat too aggressive for the size his had conquered most the states coastal including the cities the the story told herodotus the lydians were war with the medes remnant the first wave iranians the over the issue refuge the lydians had given some scythian soldiers fortune inimical the the war endured for five but the sixth eclipse the sun mentioned spontaneously halted battle progress the battle halys eclipse sun seems that thales had predicted this solar eclipse the seven sages were most likely already croesus was also heavily influenced solon athens another whether thales was present the battle not nor are the exact terms the but based the lydians and medes made peace swearing blood the medes were dependencies the persians under cyrus croesus now sided with the medes against the persians and marched the direction iran with far fewer men than was stopped the river halys then this time had thales with perhaps whatever his the king gave the problem and got the army across digging diversion upstream reduce the making possible ford the the channels ran around both sides the the two armies engaged pteria cappadocia the battle was indecisive but paralyzing both croesus marched dismissed his mercenaries and sent emissaries his dependents and allies ask them dispatch fresh troops sardis the issue became more pressing when the persian army showed diogenes laertius tells that thales gained fame counselor when advised the milesians not engage fighting with the this has sometimes been interpreted but ruler does not ally with his croesus was defeated before the city sardis who subsequently spared miletus because had taken cyrus was impressed wisdom and his connection with the sages that spared him and took his advice various the ionians were now herodotus says that thales advised them form ionian that bouleuterion deliberative located teos the center ionia the ionian cities should districts miletus however received favorable terms from the others remained ionian league cities excluding miletus and were subjugated the while herodotus reported that most his fellow greeks believe that thales did divert the river halys assist king military himself finds sagacity diogenes laertius tells that the seven sages were created the archonship damasius athens about and that thales was the first the same however asserts that thales emigrated miletus there also report that did not become student nature until after his political much would like have date the seven must reject these stories and the tempting date are believe that thales was native predicted the and was with croesus the campaign against cyrus thales received instruction from egyptian priest was fairly certain that came from established class which customarily provided higher education for their moreover the ordinary unless was seafaring man could not afford the grand tour egypt and did not consort with noble lawmakers such solon thales participated some most likely panhellenic which won bowl dedicated apollo delphi was not known have been his event was probably declamation and may have been victory some specific phase this event that led his sagacious theories the greeks often invoked idiosyncratic explanations natural phenomena reference the will anthropomorphic gods and heroes instead thales aimed explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that referenced natural processes for rather than assuming that earthquakes were the result supernatural whims thales explained them hypothesizing that the earth floats water and that earthquakes occur when the earth rocked thales was hylozoist one who thinks that matter that interpretation later that thales treated matter being may have been substituted for his thinking that the properties nature arise directly from material the latter thesis more consistent with modern ideas how properties arise emergent characteristics those complex systems involved the processes evolution and developmental change thales according aristotle asked what was the nature greek arche the object that would behave its characteristic physis comes from phyein related our word natura the way thing born again with the stamp what aristotle characterizes most the philosophers thinking that the principles the form matter were the only principles all where principle arche matter hyle wood matter material and form eidos arche translated principle but the two words not have precisely the same principle something merely prior related either chronologically arche from dominates object some the arche taken then specific causality that supposed characteristically just because comes from which dominates the archai that aristotle had mind his known passage the first greek scientists are not necessarily chronologically prior their but are constituents for pluralism objects are composed air fire and but those elements not disappear with the production the they remain archai within the atoms the what aristotle really saying that the first philosophers were trying define the which all material objects are matter that exactly what modern scientists are attempting accomplish nuclear which second reason why thales described the first western water first principle thales most famous philosophical position was his cosmological thesis which comes down through passage from aristotle metaphysics the work aristotle unequivocally reported hypothesis about the nature matter that the originating principle nature was single material substance water aristotle then proceeded proffer number conjectures based his own observations lend some credence why thales may have advanced this idea though aristotle hold aristotle considered position roughly the equivalent the later ideas anaximenes who held that everything was composed air aristotle laid out his own thinking about matter and form which may shed some light the ideas metaphysics the passage contains words that were later adopted science with quite different this quote see depiction the problem change and the definition substance asked object the same either case how can there change from one the the answer that the substance but acquires loses different qualities the things you experience aristotle conjectured that thales reached his conclusion contemplating that the nourishment all things moist and that even the hot created from the wet and lives while conjecture why thales held water was the originating principle water his own his statement that thales held was water generally accepted genuinely originating with thales and seen incipient heraclitus homericus states that thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into slime and seems likely that thales viewed the earth solidifying from the water which floated and the oceans that surround writing centuries later diogenes laertius also states that thales taught water constituted stood the principle all influences later scholastic thinkers would maintain that his choice water thales was influenced babylonian chaldean that held that god had begun creation acting upon the existing historian abraham feldman holds this does not stand under closer babylonian religion the water lifeless and sterile until god acts upon but for thales water itself was divine and maintained that all things are full and understand the nature things was discover the secrets the and through this knowledge open the possibility that one could greater than the grandest feldman points out that while other thinkers recognized the wetness the world none them was inspired conclude that everything was ultimately further points out that thales was wealthy citizen the fabulously rich oriental port dealer the staples wine and certainly handled the fish the phoenicians that secreted the dye imperial feldman recalls the stories thales measuring the distance boats the creating mechanical improvements for ship giving explanation for the flooding the nile vital egyptian agriculture and greek and changing the course the river halys army could ford rather than seeing water barrier thales contemplated the ionian yearly religious gathering for athletic ritual held the promontory mycale and believed ordained the ancestral kindred the god the called for the ionian mercantile states participating this ritual convert into democratic federation under the protection poseidon that would hold off the forces pastoral feldman concludes that thales saw that water was revolutionary leveler and the elemental factor determining the subsistence and business the and the common channel feldman considers environment and holds that thales would have seen sweat and blood granting value work and the means how life giving commodities travelled whether bodies water through the sweat slaves and would have seen that minerals could processed from water such sustaining salt and gold taken from seen fish and other food stuffs gathered from feldman points out that thales held that the lodestone was alive drew metals holds that thales living ever sight his beloved would see water seem draw all traffic wine and milk and juices and leading him vision the universe melting into single substance that was valueless itself and still the source feldman concludes that for thales water united all the social significance water the time thales induced him discern through hardware and through soil and blood sweat and one fundamental fluid the most commonplace and powerful material known this combined with his idea spontaneous generation allow see how thales could hold that water could divine and feldman points the lasting association the theory that all whatness with thales pointing out that diogenes laertius speaks probably where thales snatched heaven the perhaps was elaborate paronomasia based the fact that thal was the phoenician word for beliefs divinity thales applied his method objects that changed become other such water into earth but what about the changing thales did address the approaching through lodestone and amber which when electrified rubbing also noteworthy that the first particle known carry electric charge the electron named for the greek word for how was the power move other things without the movers changing thales saw commonality with the powers living things the lodestone and the amber must and that were there could difference between the living and the when asked why die there was replied because there aristotle defined the soul the principle that which imbues the matter and makes giving the power the idea did not originate with the greeks general believed the distinction between mind and which was ultimately lead distinction not only between body and soul but also between matter and things were they must have this belief was the ordinary ancient populations the mediterranean did believe that natural actions were caused accordingly the sources say that thales believed that all things were full their zeal make him the first everything some said was the first hold the which must have been widely known however thales was looking for something more universal substance that also was the polytheism the zeus was the very personification supreme mind dominating all the subordinate from thales however philosophers had tendency depersonify objectify though were the substance animation per and not actually god like the other the end result was total removal mind from opening the door divine principle classical however had proceeded only little way along that instead referring the zeus they talked about the great cicero water the universal mind appears roman belief virgil the spirit within spiritus strengthens heaven and earth the watery and the lucid globe and then titan and mind infused through the limbs agitates the whole and mixes itself with great matter magno reputation thales who died around years before the time pythagoras and years before euclid eudoxus cnidus and eudemus rhodes often hailed the first greek while some such colin fletcher point out that there could have been predecessor thales who been named lost book history geometry admitted that without the work the question becomes mere fletcher holds that there viable predecessor the title first greek the only question whether thales qualifies practitioner that holds that thales had his command the techniques experimentation superposition and has proved himself the evidence for the primacy thales comes from book proclus who wrote thousand years after thales but believed have had copy book proclus wrote thales was the first egypt and bring back greece this goes tell that addition applying the knowledge gained egypt himself discovered many propositions and disclosed the underlying principles many others his some case his method being more others more other quotes from proclus list more mathematical they say that thales was the first demonstrate that the circle bisected the the cause the bisection being the unimpeded passage the straight line through the said have been the first have known and have enunciated the that the angles the base any isosceles triangle are though the more archaic manner described the equal angles this that when two straight lines cut one the vertical and opposite angles are was first eudemus though the scientific demonstration was improved the writer elements eudemus his history geometry attributes this theorem the equality triangles having two angles and one side for says that the method which thales showed how find the distance ships sea necessarily involves this pamphila says having learnt geometry from the was the first inscribe circle angled whereupon sacrificed addition hieronymus rhodes also cites thales the first greek hieronymus held that thales was able measure the height the pyramids successful application geometry after gathering data using his staff and comparing its shadow those cast the receive variations story through diogenes laertius pliny the elder and plutarch due the variations among such the story the sacrifice the occasion the discovery that the angle diameter circle right the version told diogenes laertius being accredited pythagoras rather than some historians such dicks question whether such anecdotes have any historical worth practice and theory thales was known for his innovative use geometry his understanding was theoretical well for topos style space since the chorei has the connotation yielding before spreading out make room for which extension within this things have points lines planes and solids related distances and angles follow from this thales understood similar triangles and right triangles and what used that knowledge practical the story told cit that measured the height the pyramids their shadows the moment when his own shadow was equal his right triangle with two equal legs degree right all which are the length the shadow measured from the center the pyramid that moment must have been equal its this story indicates that was familiar with the egyptian seked seqed the ratio the run the rise slope cotangent the seked the base problems and the rhind papyrus ancient egyptian mathematics present day cotangents require the same units for run and rise base and but the papyrus uses cubits for rise and palms for resulting different but still numbers since there were palms the seked was times the thales theorem use example often quoted modern reference suppose the base pyramid cubits and the angle rise seked the egyptians expressed their fractions the sum but the decimals are sufficient for the what the rise the run palms the divided cubits these figures sufficed for the egyptians and would calculate the cotangent divided get and looking that table cotangents find that the angle rise few minutes over whether the ability use the which preceded thales about means that was the first define trigonometry matter more practically thales used the same method measure the distances ships said eudemus reported proclus according kirk raven reference cited all you need for this feat three straight sticks pinned one end and knowledge your one stick goes vertically into the second made with the third you sight the ship and calculate the seked from the height the stick and its distance from the point insertion the line the seked measure the knowledge two angles the seked and right and enclosed leg the allows you determine similar triangles the second which the thales probably had his own equipment rigged and recorded his own but that only thales theorem stated another actually there are two theorems called theorem one having with triangle inscribed circle and having the diameter one the other theorem being also called the intercept theorem addition eudemus attributed him the discovery that circle bisected its that the base angles isosceles triangle are equal and that vertical angles are according historical when thales visited observed that whenever the egyptians drew two intersecting they would measure the vertical angles make sure that they were thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal one accepted some general notions such all straight angles are equals added equals are and equals subtracted from equals are would hard imagine civilization without these influences due the scarcity sources concerning thales and the diversity among the ones there scholarly debate over possible influences thales and the greek mathematicians that came after historian roger cooke points out that proclus does not make any mention mesopotamian influence thales greek but shown clearly greek the use sexagesimal system measuring angles and explicit use mesopotamian astronomical cooke notes that may possibly also appear the second book elements which contains geometric constructions equivalent certain algebraic relations that are frequently encountered the cuneiform cooke notes this relation historian van der waerden among those advocating the idea mesopotamian writing follows that have abandon the traditional belief that the oldest greek mathematicians discovered geometry entirely belief that was tenable only long nothing was known about babylonian this way diminishes the stature the his genius receives only now the honour that due the honour having developed logical structure for having introduced proof into some such dicks takes issue with the idea that can determine from the questionable sources just how influenced thales was babylonian points out that while thales held have been able calculate eclipse using cycle called the saros held have been borrowed from the the however did not use cycles predict solar but computed them from observations the latitude the moon made shortly before the expected dicks cites historian neugebauer who relates that babylonian theory for predicting solar eclipse existed one can see from the very unsatisfactory situation year nor did the babylonians ever develop any theory which took the influence geographical latitude into dicks examines the cycle referred which thales held have used and which believed stem from the points out that ptolemy makes use this and another cycle his book mathematical syntaxis but attributes greek astronomers earlier than hipparchus and not dicks notes herodotus does relate that thales made use cycle predict the but maintains that the fulfillment the was stroke pure luck not goes further joining with other historians martini dreyer neugebauer rejecting the historicity the eclipse story dicks links the story thales discovering the cause for solar eclipse with claim that thales discovered the cycle the sun with relation the and concludes could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which neither the egyptians nor the babylonians nor his immediate successors josephus the only ancient historian that claims thales visited herodotus wrote that the greeks learnt the practice dividing the day into parts about the polos and the gnomon from the the exact meaning his use the word polos current theories the heavenly the tip the axis the celestial spherical concave yet even claims babylonian influence are contested some modern such zhmud who points out that the division the day into twelve parts and analogy the was known the egyptians already the second the gnomon was known both egyptians and and the idea the heavenly was not used outside greece this less controversial than the position that thales learnt babylonian mathematics the claim was influenced pointedly historian bychkov holds that the idea that the base angles isosceles triangle are equal likely came from this when building roof for home having cross section exactly isosceles triangle crucial the ridge the roof that must fit contrast symmetric square pyramid cannot have errors the base angles the faces they will not fit together historian dicks agrees that compared the greeks the era there was more advanced state mathematics among the babylonians and especially the egyptians both cultures knew the correct formulae for determining the areas and volumes simple geometrical figures such rectangles trapezoids etc the egyptians could also calculate correctly the volume the frustum pyramid with square base the babylonians used incorrect formula for and used formula for the area which gives value for good dicks also agrees that this would have had effect thales whom the most ancient sources agree was interested math and but holds that tales travels these lands are pure the ancient civilization and massive monuments egypt had profound and ineradicable impression the they attributed egyptians immemorial knowledge certain including and would claim egyptian origin for some their own ideas try and lend them respectable such the hermetic literature the alexandrian dicks holds that since thales was prominent figure greek history the time eudemus but nothing certain was known except that lived tradition developed that milesians were position able travel thales must have gone herodotus says egypt was the birthplace geometry must have learnt that while since had have been surely one the theories nile flooding laid out herodotus must have come from likewise must have been egypt had have done something with the pyramids thus the tale measuring similar apocryphal stories exist pythagoras and plato traveling egypt with corroborating the egyptian and babylonian geometry the time was essentially they used actual numbers and the procedure then described with explicit instructions what with these there was mention how the rules procedure were and nothing toward logically arranged corpus generalized geometrical knowledge with analytical such find the words archimedes and even had thales traveled there could not have learnt anything about the theorems held have picked there especially because there evidence that any greeks this age could use egyptian likewise until around the second century and the time hipparchus the babylonian general division the circle into degrees and their sexagesimal system was herodotus says almost nothing about babylonian literature and and very little about their some like schnabel hold that the greeks only learned more about babylonian culture from babylonian priest who said have set school cos around but what extent this had the field geometry dicks points out that the primitive state greek mathematics and astronomical ideas exhibited the peculiar notions successors such anaximenes xenophanes and which historian heiberg calls mixture brilliant intuition and childlike argues against the assertions from writers late antiquity that thales discovered and taught advanced concepts these interpretations the long sojourn philosophy there has existed hardly philosopher historian philosophy who did not mention thales and try characterize him some generally recognized having brought something new human mathematics astronomy and medicine already thales added something these different collections knowledge produce which far writing tells was not tradition but resulted new ever interested persons have been asking what that new something answers fall into two the theory and the once answer has been arrived the next logical step ask how thales compares other which leads his classification rightly theory the most natural epithets thales are materialist and naturalist which are based ousia and the catholic encyclopedia notes that aristotle called him with the meaning student the other would have qualified early physicist did they studied bodies the medieval descendants most agree that stamp thought the unity hence bertrand russell states aggregation russell was only reflecting established for nietzsche his philosophy the tragic age the greeks wrote water this sort however should not confused with deterministic thales was only trying explain the unity observed the free play the the arrival uncertainty the modern world made possible return for john elof boodin writes god and boodin defines emergent materialism which the objects sense emerge uncertainly from the thales the innovator this sort rise theoretical inquiry the thales represents new kind inquiring community edmund husserl attempts capture the new movement philosophical man new cultural based stepping back from pregiven and taking rational inquiry into what true that ideal begins with isolated individuals such but they are supported and cooperated with time goes finally the ideal transforms the norms leaping across national classification the term pre socratic derives ultimately from the philosopher who distinguished the early philosophers concerning themselves with diogenes laertius the other hand took strictly geographic and ethnic philosophers were either ionian used ionian broader including also the athenian who were not from philosophic point any grouping all would have been just there basis for ionian italian some however concede scheme far referring ionian school there was such school any the most popular approach refers milesian which more justifiable socially and they sought for the substance phenomena and may have studied with each some ancient writers qualify them influence others thales union station thales had profound influence other greek thinkers and therefore western history some believe anaximander was pupil early sources report that one more famous pythagoras visited thales young and that thales advised him travel egypt further his philosophical and mathematical many philosophers followed lead searching for explanations nature rather than the others returned supernatural but couched them the language philosophy rather than myth religion looking specifically influence during the socratic clear that stood out one the first thinkers who thought more the way logos than mythos the difference between these two more profound ways seeing the world that mythos concentrated around the stories holy while logos concentrated around the when the mythical man wants explain the world the way sees explains based gods and mythical thought does not differentiate between things and persons citation needed and furthermore does not differentiate between nature and culture citation needed the way logos thinker would present world view radically different from the way the mythical its concrete logos way thinking not only about individualism clarification needed but also the abstract clarification needed furthermore focuses sensible and continuous this lays the foundation philosophy and its way explaining the world terms abstract and not the way gods and mythical stories citation needed reliability sources nuremberg chronicle because elevated status greek culture intense interest and admiration followed his due this the oral stories about his life were open amplification and historical even before they were written down generations most modern dissension comes from trying interpret what distinguishing legend from historian dicks and other historians divide the ancient sources about thales into those before and those after that year some such proclus writing the century and simplicius cilicia the century writing nearly millennium after his the first category includes herodotus plato aristotle aristophanes and theophrastus among the second category includes plautus aetius eusebius plutarch josephus iamblichus diogenes rtius theon smyrna apuleius clement alexandria pliny the elder and john tzetzes among the earliest sources thales living before are often the same for the other milesian philosophers anaximander and anaximenes these sources were either roughly contemporaneous such herodotus lived within few hundred years his moreover they were writing from oral tradition that was widespread and well known the greece their the latter sources thales are several ascriptions commentators and compilers who lived anything from years after his which include anecdotes varying degrees and the opinion some historians such dicks historical worth dicks points out that there agreement among the even the most fundamental facts his whether was milesian whether left any writings whether was married much less the actual ideas and achievements with which contrasting the work the more ancient writers with those the dicks points out that the works the early writers thales and the other men who would hailed the seven sages had different reputation than that which would assigned them later closer their own thales solon bias priene pittacus mytilene and others were hailed essentially practical men who played leading roles the affairs their respective and were far better known the earlier greeks lawgivers and statesmen than profound thinkers and for plato praises him coupled with anacharsis for being the originator the wheel and the only the writings the second group writers working after obtain the picture thales the pioneer greek scientific particularly regard mathematics and astronomy which supposed have learnt about babylonia and rather than the earlier tradition favourite example the intelligent man who possesses some technical know the later doxographers such dicaearchus the latter half the fourth century foist him any number discoveries and order build him figure superhuman dicks points out further problem arises the surviving information for rather than using ancient sources closer the era the authors later antiquity excerptors and actually preferred use one more that what actually read them comes not even but third fourth fifth obviously this use intermediate copied and recopied from century with each writer adding additional pieces information greater less plausibility from his own provided fertile field for errors wrong and fictitious dicks points out that certain doctrines that later commentators invented for were then accepted into the biographical being copied subsequent writers who were then cited those coming after them and because they may repeated different authors relying different may produce illusory impression doubts even exist when considering the philosophical positions held originate thales reality these stem directly from own interpretations which then became incorporated the doxographical tradition erroneous ascriptions the same treatment was given aristotle anaxagoras most philosophic analyses the philosophy thales come from aristotle professional tutor alexander the great who wrote years after death aristotle judging from his surviving does not seem have access any works although probably had access works other authors about such herodotus hecataeus plato etc well others whose work now was express goal present work not because was significant but prelude his own work natural geoffrey kirk and john raven english compilers the fragments the assert that judgments are often distorted his view earlier philosophy stumbling progress toward the truth that aristotle himself revealed his physical there was also extensive oral both the oral and the written were commonly read known all educated men the aristotle philosophy had distinct professed the theory matter and which modern scholastics have dubbed hylomorphism though once very was not generally adopted rationalist and modern mainly useful metaphysical analyses but does not lend itself the detail that interest modern not clear that the theory matter and form existed early and whether thales espoused while some like snell maintain that aristotle was relying platonic written record hippias rather than oral this controversial representing the scholarly consensus dicks states that the tradition about him even early the fifth century was evidently based entirely would seem that already time the early ionians were largely names only which popular tradition attached various ideas achievements with greater less points out that works confirmed have existed the sixth century anaximander and xenophanes had already disappeared the fourth century the chances socratic material surviving the age aristotle almost nil even less likely for pupils theophrastus and eudemus and less likely still for those following after the main secondary source concerning the details life and career diogenes laertius lives eminent philosophers this primarily biographical the name compared diogenes not much the one the prologue that responsible for the division the early philosophers into ionian and italian but places the academics the ionian school and otherwise evidences considerable disarray and especially the long section forerunners the ionian diogenes quotes two letters attributed but diogenes wrote some eight centuries after death and that his sources often contained unreliable even fabricated hence the concern for separating fact from legend accounts due this use hearsay and lack citing original sources that leads some like dicks and werner look the late origin the traditional picture socratic philosophy and view the whole idea construct from later the whole picture that has come down the history early philosophy was fashioned during the two three generations from plato the immediate pupils see also know thyself material monism the astrologer who fell
