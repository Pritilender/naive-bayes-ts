often been divided into some major based either the questions typically addressed people working different parts the notions ideological the ancient the most influential division the subject was the stoics division philosophy into logic ethics and physics conceived the study the nature the and including both natural science and metaphysics contemporary specialties within the field are more commonly divided into metaphysics epistemology ethics and aesthetics the latter two which together comprise axiology logic sometimes included main branch sometimes separate science philosophers happen work and sometimes just characteristically philosophical method applying all branches within these broad branches there are now numerous disciplines the broadest level there the division between analytic the english speaking world and nordic countries and continental philosophy the rest for continental philosophy subdividing philosophy between experts problematic for the very nature the interdisciplinary task philosophy however for most analytic philosophy further divisions simplify the task for philosophers each the interest particular disciplines waxes and wanes over sometimes disciplines become particularly hot topics and can occupy much space the literature that they almost seem like major branches their own over the past years philosophy mind which generally mainly

cosmology alongside his metaphysics and even the eighteenth century physics and chemistry were still classified natural philosophy that the philosophical study today these latter subjects are popularly referred sciences and separate from but the distinction not some philosophers still contend that science retains and link more psychology economics sociology and linguistics were once the

philosophy mind philosophy done primarily through reflection and critical thought does not tend rely experiment however some ways philosophy close science its character and some analytic philosophers have suggested that the method philosophical analysis allows philosophers emulate the methods natural quine holds that philosophy does more than clarify the arguments and claims other this suggests that philosophy might the study meaning and reasoning but some still would claim either that this not that ought not pursued all these views have something whatever philosophy essentially concerned tends the whole proceed more abstractly than most most natural does not depend much experience and and does not contribute directly clearly would mistake identify philosophy with any one natural whether can identified with science very broadly construed still open this active discipline pursued both trained philosophers and philosophers often refer and experimental work various kinds philosophy physics and philosophy psychology but this not such branches philosophy aim philosophical understanding experimental not the philosophers their capacity philosophers who perform the experiments and formulate the scientific theories under philosophy science should not confused with science studies any more than biology should confused with plants and theology and religious studies like most religious studies are not parts theology including questions about the existence and nature clearly overlap with philosophy religion aristotle considered theology branch metaphysics the central field and most philosophers prior the twentieth century have devoted significant effort theological the two are not but other part religious such the comparison different world can easily distinguished from philosophy just the way that any other social science can distinguished from these are closer history and and involve specific observations particular here particular religious the empiricist tradition modern philosophy often held that religious questions are beyond the scope human and many have claimed that religious language literally there are not even questions some philosophers have felt that these difficulties evidence were and have argued against just about religious beliefs moral other nonetheless the main stream twentieth century philosophy there were very few philosophers who give serious consideration religious mathematics mathematics uses very rigorous methods proof that philosophers sometimes only try most philosophy written ordinary and while strives precise does not usually attain anything like mathematical mathematicians hardly ever disagree about while philosophers course disagree about their well their methods the philosophy
