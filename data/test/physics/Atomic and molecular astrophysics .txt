physics	atomic and molecular astrophysics atomic and molecular astrophysics navigation search carina nebula atomic astrophysics concerned with performing atomic physics calculations that will useful astronomers and using atomic data interpret astronomical atomic physics plays key role astrophysics only information about particular object comes through the light that and this light arises through atomic transitions molecular astrophysics developed into rigorous field investigation theoretical astrochemist alexander dalgarno beginning concerns the study emission from molecules there are currently known interstellar these molecules have large numbers observable lines may also observed absorption for example the highly redshifted lines seen against the gravitationally lensed quasar high energy such ultraviolet light can break the molecular bonds which hold atoms general molecules are found cool astrophysical the most massive objects our galaxy are giant clouds molecules and creatively named giant molecular clouds these and smaller versions stars and planets are one the primary fields study molecular astrophysics star and planet molecules may found many however from stellar atmospheres those planetary most these locations are and molecular emission most easily studied via photons emitted when the molecules make transitions between low rotational energy one composed the abundant carbon and oxygen and very stable against dissociation into carbon the wavelength the photon emitted when the molecule falls from its lowest excited state its zero state gigahertz billion this frequency thousand times higher than typical radio these high molecules the atmosphere can block transmissions from and telescopes must located dry water important atmospheric high radio telescopes must have very accurate surfaces produce high fidelity february nasa announced greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the universe according more than the carbon the universe may associated with possible starting materials for the formation life pahs seem have been formed shortly after the big bang are widespread throughout the and are associated with new stars and exoplanets see also alexander dalgarno astrochemistry astrophysics molecular and optical physics cosmochemistry interstellar medium molecular modelling quantum dynamics spectroscopy
