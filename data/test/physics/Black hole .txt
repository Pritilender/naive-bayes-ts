kelvin for black holes stellar mass making all but impossible objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light escape were first considered the century john michell and pierre simon laplace

lensing galaxy larger animation the idea body massive that even light could not escape was first put forward john michell letter written henry cavendish the royal society the diameter sphere the same density the sun were exceed that the sun the proportion body falling from infinite height towards would have acquired its surface greater velocity than that and consequently supposing light attracted the same force proportion its vis with other all light emitted from such body would made return towards its own proper mathematician pierre simon laplace promoted the same idea the first and second editions his book exposition monde was removed from later such dark stars were largely ignored the nineteenth since was not understood how massless wave such light could influenced general relativity albert einstein developed his theory general relativity having earlier shown that gravity does influence only few months karl schwarzschild found solution the einstein field equations which describes the gravitational field point mass and spherical few months after johannes student hendrik lorentz independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its this solution had peculiar behaviour what now called the schwarzschild radius where became singular meaning that some the terms the einstein equations became the nature this surface was not quite understood the arthur eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after change coordinates see eddington finkelstein coordinates although took until for georges tre realize that this meant the singularity the schwarzschild radius was unphysical coordinate singularity subrahmanyan chandrasekhar calculated using special that rotating body electron degenerate matter above certain limiting mass now called the chandrasekhar limit solar has stable his arguments were opposed many his contemporaries like eddington and lev landau who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the they were partly white dwarf slightly more massive than the chandrasekhar limit will collapse into neutron star which itself stable because the pauli exclusion principle but robert oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately three solar masses the tolman volkoff limit would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented and concluded that law physics was likely intervene and stop least some stars from collapsing black oppenheimer and his authors interpreted the singularity the boundary the schwarzschild radius indicating that this was the boundary bubble which time this valid point view for external but not for infalling because this the collapsed stars were called frozen because outside observer would see the surface the star frozen time the instant where its collapse takes inside the schwarzschild golden age golden age general relativity david finkelstein identified the schwarzschild surface event horizon perfect unidirectional causal influences can cross only one this did not strictly contradict but extended them include the point view infalling finkelstein solution extended the schwarzschild solution for the future observers falling into black complete extension had already been found martin kruskal who was urged publish these results came the beginning the golden age general relativity which was marked general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects this process was helped the discovery pulsars which were shown rapidly rotating neutron stars until that neutron like black were regarded just theoretical but the discovery pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred further interest all types compact objects that might formed gravitational this period more general black hole solutions were roy kerr found the exact solution for rotating black hole two years ezra newman found the axisymmetric solution for black hole that both rotating and electrically charged through the work werner israel brandon carter and david robinson the hair theorem emerged stating that stationary black hole solution completely described the three parameters the kerr newman metric mass angular momentum and electric charge was suspected that the strange features the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions and that the singularities would not appear generic this view was held particular vladimir belinsky isaak khalatnikov and evgeny lifshitz who tried prove that singularities appear generic however the late roger penrose and stephen hawking used global techniques prove that singularities appear work james bardeen jacob bekenstein carter and hawking the early led the formulation black hole thermodynamics these laws describe the behaviour black hole close analogy the laws thermodynamics relating mass area entropy and surface gravity temperature the analogy was completed when showed that quantum field theory predicts that black holes should radiate like black body with temperature proportional the surface gravity the black the first use the term black print was journalist ann ewing her article black dated january which was report meeting the american association for the advancement science john wheeler used term black lecture leading some credit him with coining the after use the was quickly adopted general properties and structure the hair theorem states once achieves stable condition after black hole has only three independent physical mass charge and angular momentum any two black holes that share the same values for these are indistinguishable according classical non quantum mechanics these properties are special because they are visible from outside black for charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged similarly the total mass inside sphere containing black hole can found using the gravitational analog gauss law the adm mass far away from the black likewise the angular momentum can measured from far away using frame dragging the gravitomagnetic field when object falls into black any information about the shape the object distribution charge evenly distributed along the horizon the black and lost outside the behavior the horizon this situation dissipative system that closely analogous that conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical resistance the membrane paradigm this different from other field theories like which not have any friction resistivity the microscopic because they are time reversible because black hole eventually achieves stable state with only three there way avoid losing information about the initial the gravitational and electric fields black hole give very little information about what went the information that lost includes every quantity that cannot measured far away from the black hole including approximately conserved quantum numbers such the total baryon number and lepton number this behavior puzzling that has been called the black hole information loss paradox physical properties the simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular these black holes are often referred schwarzschild black holes after karl schwarzschild who discovered this solution according birkhoff theorem the only vacuum solution that spherically symmetric this means that there observable difference between the gravitational field such black hole and that any other spherical object the same the popular notion black hole sucking its surroundings therefore only correct near black far the external gravitational field identical that any other body the same solutions describing more general black holes also charged black holes are described the reissner metric while the kerr metric describes rotating black hole the most general stationary black hole solution known the kerr newman metric which describes black hole with both charge and angular while the mass black hole can take any positive the charge and angular momentum are constrained the planck units the total electric and the total angular are expected satisfy for black hole mass black holes saturating this inequality are called extremal solutions equations that violate this inequality but they not possess event these solutions have called naked singularities that can observed from the and hence are deemed unphysical the cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation such when they are created through the gravitational collapse realistic matter this supported numerical due the relatively large strength the electromagnetic force black holes forming from the collapse stars are expected retain the nearly neutral charge the rotation however expected common feature compact the hole candidate binary ray source grs appears have angular momentum near the maximum allowed supermassive black hole mass black hole stellar black hole micro black hole moon black holes are commonly classified according their independent angular momentum electric charge the size black determined the radius the event schwarzschild radius roughly proportional the mass through where the schwarzschild radius and the mass the sun this relation exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular for more general black holes can differ factor event horizon event horizon note the defining feature black hole the appearance event boundary spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass the black nothing not even can escape from inside the event the event horizon referred such because event occurs within the information from that event cannot reach outside making impossible determine such event predicted general the presence mass deforms spacetime such way that the paths taken particles bend towards the the event horizon black this deformation becomes strong that there are paths that lead away from the black distant clocks near black hole appear tick more slowly than those further away from the black due this known gravitational time dilation object falling into black hole appears slow down approaches the event taking infinite time reach the same all processes this object slow for fixed outside causing emitted light appear redder and effect known gravitational redshift eventually point just before reaches the event the falling object becomes dim that can longer the other indestructible observer falling into black hole does not notice any these effects crosses the event according his own which appears him tick crosses the event horizon after finite time without noting any singular unable determine exactly when crosses impossible determine the location the event horizon from local the shape the event horizon black hole always approximately note for rotating black holes the geometry precisely while for rotating black holes the sphere somewhat singularity gravitational singularity the center black hole described general relativity lies gravitational singularity region where the spacetime curvature becomes for rotating black this region takes the shape single point and for rotating black hole smeared out form ring singularity lying the plane both the singular region has zero can also shown that the singular region contains all the mass the black hole the singular region can thus thought having infinite density observers falling into schwarzschild black hole non rotating and not cannot avoid being carried into the once they cross the event they can prolong the experience accelerating away slow their but only after attaining certain ideal best free fall the rest the when they reach the they are crushed infinite density and their mass added the total the black before that they will have been torn apart the growing tidal forces process sometimes referred spaghettification the noodle the case charged rotating black possible avoid the extending these solutions far possible reveals the hypothetical possibility exiting the black hole into different spacetime with the black hole acting wormhole the possibility traveling another universe however only since any perturbation will destroy this also appears possible follow closed timelike curves going back own around the kerr which lead problems with causality like the grandfather paradox expected that none these peculiar effects would survive proper quantum treatment rotating and charged black the appearance singularities general relativity commonly perceived signaling the breakdown the this however occurs situation where quantum effects should describe these due the extremely high density and therefore particle has not been possible combine quantum and gravitational effects into single although there exist attempts formulate such theory quantum gravity generally expected that such theory will not feature any photon sphere photon sphere the photon sphere spherical boundary zero thickness such that photons moving along tangents the sphere will trapped circular for rotating black the photon sphere has radius times the schwarzschild the orbits are dynamically unstable hence any small perturbation such particle infalling will grow over either setting outward trajectory escaping the black hole inward spiral eventually crossing the event while light can still escape from inside the photon any light that crosses the photon sphere inbound trajectory will captured the black hence any light reaching outside observer from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted objects inside the photon sphere but still outside the event other compact objects such neutron stars can also have photon this follows from the fact that the gravitational field object does not depend its actual hence any object that smaller than times the schwarzschild radius corresponding its mass will indeed have photon ergosphere ergosphere rotating black holes are surrounded region spacetime which impossible stand called the this the result process known frame dragging general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend slightly drag along the spacetime immediately surrounding any object near the rotating mass will tend start moving the direction for rotating black this effect becomes strong near the event horizon that object would have move faster than the speed light the opposite direction just stand the ergosphere black hole bounded the event horizon the inside and oblate spheroid which coincides with the event horizon the poles and noticeably wider around the the outer boundary sometimes called the ergosurface objects and radiation can escape normally from the through the penrose process objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they this energy taken from the rotational energy the black hole causing slow formation and evolution considering the exotic nature black may natural question such bizarre objects could exist nature suggest that they are merely pathological solutions einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not because held that the angular momentum collapsing particles would stabilize their motion some this led the general relativity community dismiss all results the contrary for many however minority relativists continued contend that black holes were physical and the end the they had persuaded the majority researchers the field that there obstacle forming event once event horizon penrose proved that singularity will form somewhere inside shortly hawking showed that many cosmological solutions describing the big bang have singularities without scalar fields other exotic matter see penrose hawking singularity theorems the kerr solution the hair theorem and the laws black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties black holes were simple and making them respectable subjects for the primary formation process for black holes expected the gravitational collapse heavy objects such but there are also more exotic processes that can lead the production black gravitational collapse gravitational collapse gravitational collapse occurs when internal pressure insufficient resist the own for stars this usually occurs either because star has too little fuel left maintain its temperature through stellar nucleosynthesis because star that would have been stable receives extra matter way that does not raise its core either case the temperature longer high enough prevent from collapsing under its own the collapse may stopped the degeneracy pressure the condensing the matter exotic denser state the result one the various types compact star the type compact star formed depends the mass the the matter left over after the outer layers have been blown such from supernova explosion pulsations leading planetary nebula note that this mass can substantially less than the original remnants exceeding solar masses are produced stars that were over solar masses before the the mass the remnant exceeds about solar masses the tolman volkoff limit either because the original star was very heavy because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion even the degeneracy pressure neutrons insufficient stop the known mechanism except possibly quark degeneracy see quark star powerful enough stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse form black the gravitational collapse heavy stars assumed responsible for the formation stellar mass black holes star formation the early universe may have resulted very massive which upon their collapse would have produced black holes solar these black holes could the seeds the supermassive black holes found the centers most while most the energy released during gravitational collapse emitted very outside observer does not actually see the end this even though the collapse takes finite amount time from the reference frame infalling distant observer sees the infalling material slow and halt just above the event due gravitational time dilation light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer reach the with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed infinite amount thus the external observer never sees the formation the event instead the collapsing material seems become dimmer and increasingly eventually fading primordial black holes the big bang gravitational collapse requires great the current epoch the universe these high densities are only found but the early universe shortly after the big bang densities were much possibly allowing for the creation black the high density alone not enough allow the formation black holes since uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass bunch order for primordial black holes form such dense there must initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own different models for the early universe vary widely their predictions the size these various models predict the creation black ranging from planck mass hundreds thousands solar primordial black holes could thus account for the creation any type black high energy collisions gravitational collapse not the only process that could create black black holes could formed high energy collisions that achieve sufficient such events have been either directly indirectly deficiency the mass balance particle accelerator experiments this suggests that there must lower limit for the mass black theoretically this boundary expected lie around the planck mass gev where quantum effects are expected invalidate the predictions general this would put the creation black holes firmly out reach any energy process occurring near the however certain developments quantum gravity suggest that the planck mass could much some braneworld scenarios for example put the boundary low this would make conceivable for micro black holes created the energy collisions occurring when cosmic rays hit the possibly the new large hadron collider cern yet these theories are very and the creation black holes these processes deemed unlikely many even micro black holes should formed these expected that they would evaporate about seconds posing threat the growth once black hole has can continue grow absorbing additional any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its direct surroundings and omnipresent cosmic background radiation this the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem have similar process has been suggested for the formation intermediate mass black holes globular clusters another possibility for black hole merge with other objects such stars even other black although not necessary for this thought have been especially for the early development supermassive black which could have formed from the coagulation many smaller the process has also been proposed the origin some intermediate mass black holes evaporation hawking radiation hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts thermal this effect that has become known hawking radiation applying quantum field theory static black hole determined that black hole should emit particles perfect black body spectrum since many others have verified the result through various theory black hole radiation then black holes are expected shrink and evaporate over time because they lose mass the emission photons and other the temperature this thermal spectrum hawking temperature proportional the surface gravity the black which for schwarzschild black inversely proportional the hence large black holes emit less radiation than small black stellar black hole one solar mass has hawking temperature about nanokelvins this far less than the temperature the cosmic microwave background radiation stellar mass larger black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through hawking radiation and thus will grow instead have hawking temperature larger than and able black hole needs have less mass than the moon such black hole would have diameter less than tenth black hole very small the radiation effects are expected become very even black hole that heavy compared human would evaporate black hole the weight car would have diameter about and take nanosecond during which time would briefly have luminosity more than times that the lower mass black holes are expected evaporate even for black hole mass would take less than seconds evaporate for such small black quantum gravitation effects are expected play important role and could although current developments quantum gravity not indicate hypothetically make such small black hole observational evidence milky way their very black holes not directly emit any signals other than the hypothetical hawking radiation since the hawking radiation for astrophysical black hole predicted very this makes impossible directly detect astrophysical black holes from the possible exception the hawking radiation being weak the last stage the evaporation light black searches for such flashes the past have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits the possibility existence light primordial black nasa fermi ray space telescope launched will continue the search for these astrophysicists searching for black holes thus have rely indirect black existence can sometimes inferred observing its gravitational interactions with its project run haystack observatory attempting observe the event horizon black hole initial results are accretion matter accretion disc play media due conservation angular momentum gas falling into the gravitational well created massive object will typically form like structure around the friction within the disc causes angular momentum transported allowing matter fall further releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature the the case compact objects such white dwarfs neutron stars and black the gas the inner regions becomes hot that will emit vast amounts radiation mainly which may detected this process accretion one the most efficient producing processes the rest mass the accreted material can emitted nuclear fusion only about the rest mass will emitted many accretion discs are accompanied relativistic jets emitted along the which carry away much the the mechanism for the creation these jets currently not well such many the more energetic phenomena have been attributed the accretion matter black active galactic nuclei and quasars are believed the accretion discs supermassive black similarly ray binaries are generally accepted binary star systems which one the two stars compact object accreting matter from its has also been suggested that some ultraluminous ray sources may the accretion disks intermediate mass black holes ray binaries ray binary ray binaries are binary star systems that are luminous the ray part the these ray emissions are generally thought caused one the component stars being compact object accreting matter from the other star the presence ordinary star such system provides unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining might black such system emits signals that can directly traced back the compact cannot black the absence such signal however not exclude the possibility that the compact object neutron studying the companion star often possible obtain the orbital parameters the system and obtain estimate for the mass the compact this much larger than the volkoff limit that the maximum mass neutron star can have before then the object cannot neutron star and generally expected black play media the first strong candidate for black cygnus was discovered this way charles thomas bolton louise webster and paul murdin some however remained due the uncertainties resultant from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black currently better candidates for black holes are found class ray binaries called soft ray this class system the companion star relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates the black hole moreover these systems are only active ray for several months once every years during the period low ray emission called the accretion disc extremely faint allowing for detailed observation the companion star during this one the best such candidates cyg quiescence and dominated accretion flow the faintness the accretion disc during quiescence suspected caused the flow entering mode called advection dominated accretion flow this almost all the energy generated friction the disc swept along with the flow instead radiated this model then forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence event because the object the center the disc had solid would emit large amounts radiation the highly energetic gas hits the effect that observed for neutron stars similar quasi periodic oscillations periodic oscillations the ray emission from accretion disks sometimes flickers certain these signals are called quasi periodic oscillations and are thought caused material moving along the inner edge the accretion disk the innermost stable circular such their frequency linked the mass the compact they can thus used alternative way determine the mass potential black galactic nuclei active galactic nucleus astronomers use the term active galaxy describe galaxies with unusual such unusual spectral line emission and very strong radio theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity these active galactic nuclei may explained the presence supermassive black the models these agn consist central black hole that may millions billions times more massive than the sun disk gas and dust called accretion and two jets that are perpendicular the accretion although supermassive black holes are expected found most only some nuclei have been more carefully studied attempts both identify and measure the actual masses the central supermassive black hole some the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the andromeda galaxy ngc ngc ngc ngc ngc apm and the sombrero galaxy now widely accepted that the center nearly every not just active contains supermassive black the close observational correlation between the mass this hole and the velocity dispersion the host bulge known the sigma relation strongly suggests connection between the formation the black hole and the galaxy currently the best evidence for supermassive black hole comes from studying the proper motion stars near the center our own milky way since astronomers have tracked the motion stars region called sagittarius fitting their motion keplerian orbits they were able infer that million solar masses must contained volume with radius lightyears since then one the called has completed full from the orbital data they were able place better constraints the mass and size the object causing the orbital motion stars the sagittarius region finding that there spherical mass million solar masses contained within radius less than lightyears while this more than times the schwarzschild radius corresponding that least consistent with the central object being supermassive black and realistic cluster physically effects strong gravity another way that the black hole nature object may tested the future through observation effects caused strong gravity their one such effect gravitational lensing the deformation spacetime around massive object causes light rays deflected much like light passing through optic lens observations have been made weak gravitational which light rays are deflected only few arcseconds however has never been directly observed for black one possibility for observing gravitational lensing black hole would observe stars orbit around the black there are several candidates for such observation orbit around sagittarius another option would the direct observation gravitational waves produced object falling into black for example compact object falling into supermassive black hole through extreme mass ratio inspiral matching the observed waveform the predictions general relativity would allow precision measurements the mass and angular momentum the central while the same time testing general these types events are primary target for the proposed laser interferometer space antenna alternatives exotic star the evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies the existence upper limit for the mass neutron the size this limit heavily depends the assumptions made about the properties dense new exotic phases matter could push this phase free quarks high density might allow the existence dense quark stars and some supersymmetric models predict the existence stars some extensions the standard model posit the existence preons fundamental building blocks quarks and leptons which could hypothetically form preon stars these hypothetical models could potentially explain number observations stellar black hole however can shown from general arguments general relativity that any such object will have maximum since the average density black hole inside its schwarzschild radius inversely proportional the square its supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes the average density solar mass black hole comparable that consequently the physics matter forming supermassive black hole much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more for supermassive black hole could modelled large cluster very dark however such alternatives are typically not stable enough explain the supermassive black hole the evidence for stellar and supermassive black holes implies that order for black holes not general relativity must fail theory perhaps due the onset quantum mechanical corrections much anticipated feature theory quantum gravity that will not feature singularities event horizons and thus black much attention has been drawn the fuzzball model string theory based calculations specific situations string the proposal suggests that generically the individual states black hole solution not have event horizon but that for classical observer the statistical average such states does appear just like ordinary black hole general open questions entropy and thermodynamics black hole thermodynamics hawking entropy speed light boltzmann constant constant reduced planck constant hawking showed under general conditions note that the total area the event horizons any collection classical black holes can never even they collide and this now known the second law black hole mechanics remarkably similar the second law thermodynamics which states that the total entropy system can never with classical objects absolute zero temperature was assumed that black holes had zero this were the the second law thermodynamics would violated laden matter entering black resulting decrease the total entropy the therefore bekenstein proposed that black hole should have and that should proportional its horizon the link with the laws thermodynamics was further strengthened discovery that quantum field theory predicts that black hole radiates blackbody radiation constant this seemingly causes violation the second law black hole since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing the however also carries away and can proven under general assumptions that the sum the entropy the matter surrounding black hole and one quarter the area the horizon measured planck units fact always this allows the formulation the first law black hole mechanics analogue the first law thermodynamics with the mass acting the surface gravity temperature and the area one puzzling feature that the entropy black hole scales with its area rather than with its since entropy normally extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume the this odd property led gerard hooft and leonard susskind propose the holographic principle which suggests that anything that happens volume spacetime can described data the boundary that although general relativity can used perform classical calculation black hole this situation theoretically statistical mechanics entropy understood counting the number microscopic configurations system that have the same macroscopic qualities such mass charge pressure etc without satisfactory theory quantum gravity one cannot perform such computation for black some progress has been made various approaches quantum andrew strominger and cumrun vafa showed that counting the microstates specific supersymmetric black hole string theory reproduced the hawking since similar results have been reported for different black holes both string theory and other approaches quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity information loss paradox black hole information paradox list unsolved problems physics physical information lost black because black hole has only few internal most the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole regardless the type matter which goes into black appears that only information concerning the total charge and angular momentum are long black holes were thought persist forever this information loss not that the information can thought existing inside the black inaccessible from the however black holes slowly evaporate emitting hawking radiation this radiation does not appear carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black meaning that this information appears gone the question whether information truly lost black holes the black hole information paradox has divided the theoretical physics community see thorne preskill bet quantum loss information corresponds the violation vital property called unitarity which has with the conservation has been argued that loss unitarity would also imply violation conservation over recent years evidence has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved full quantum
