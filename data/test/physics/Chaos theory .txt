engineering economics biology and philosophy chaos theory studies the behavior dynamical systems that are highly sensitive initial paradigm popularly referred the butterfly effect small differences initial conditions such those due rounding errors numerical yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical rendering term prediction impossible this happens even though these systems are deterministic meaning that their future behavior fully determined their initial with random elements other the deterministic nature these systems does not make them this behavior known deterministic chaos simply chaos the theory was summarized edward lorenz chaos when the present determines the but the approximate present does not approximately determine the chaotic behavior can observed many natural such weather and this behavior can studied through analysis chaotic mathematical model through analytical techniques such recurrence plots and poincar maps contents introduction chaotic dynamics sensitivity initial conditions topological mixing density periodic orbits strange attractors minimum complexity chaotic system spontaneous order history distinguishing random from chaotic data applications computer science biology other areas cultural references see also references scientific literature articles textbooks semitechnical and popular works external links introduction chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can principle chaotic systems are predictable for while and then appear become the amount time for which the behavior chaotic system can effectively predicted depends three how much uncertainty are willing tolerate the how accurately are able measure its current and time scale depending the dynamics the called the lyapunov time some examples lyapunov times chaotic electrical millisecond weather couple days the solar million chaotic systems the uncertainty forecast increases exponentially with elapsed hence doubling the forecast time squares the proportional uncertainty the this means that practice meaningful prediction cannot made over interval more than two three times the lyapunov when meaningful predictions cannot the system appears chaotic dynamics mod common chaos means state however chaos the term defined more although there universally accepted mathematical definition commonly used definition says for dynamical system classified must have the following must sensitive initial must topologically mixing and must have dense periodic orbits sensitivity initial conditions sensitivity initial conditions means that each point chaotic system arbitrarily closely approximated other points with significantly different future thus arbitrarily small the current trajectory may lead significantly different future has been shown that some cases the last two properties the above actually imply sensitivity initial and attention restricted intervals the second property implies the other two and general definition chaos uses only the first two properties the above interesting that the most practically significant that sensitivity initial redundant the being implied two for one purely topological properties which are therefore greater interest sensitivity initial conditions popularly known the butterfly effect called because the title paper given edward lorenz the american association for the advancement science entitled predictability does the flap wings brazil set off tornado the flapping wing represents small change the initial condition the which causes chain events leading scale had the butterfly not flapped its the trajectory the system might have been vastly consequence sensitivity initial conditions that start with only finite amount information about the system usually the case then beyond certain time the system will longer this most familiar the case which generally predictable only about week course this does not mean that cannot say anything about events far the there are some restrictions the with know that the temperature will never reach degrees celsius fall degrees celsius but are not able say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature the more mathematical the lyapunov exponent measures the sensitivity initial given two starting trajectories the phase space that are infinitesimally with initial separation end diverging rate given where the time and the lyapunov the rate separation depends the orientation the initial separation there whole spectrum lyapunov the number lyapunov exponents equal the number dimensions the phase though common just refer the largest for the maximal lyapunov exponent most often used because determines the overall predictability the positive mle usually taken indication that the system there are also other properties that relate sensitivity initial such measure theoretical mixing discussed ergodic theory and properties system topological mixing otherwise topological mixing topological mixing topological transitivity means that the system will evolve over time that any given region open set its phase space will eventually overlap with any other given this mathematical concept mixing corresponds the standard and the mixing colored dyes fluids example chaotic topological mixing often omitted from popular accounts which equate chaos with only sensitivity initial however sensitive dependence initial conditions alone does not give for consider the simple dynamical system produced repeatedly doubling initial this system has sensitive dependence initial conditions since any pair nearby points will eventually become widely however this example has topological and therefore has indeed has extremely simple all points except will tend positive negative density periodic orbits for chaotic system have dense periodic orbit means that every point the space approached arbitrarily closely periodic the dimensional logistic map defined one the simplest systems with density periodic for approximately orbit period and similar orbits exist for periods etc for all the periods specified sharkovskii theorem sharkovskii theorem the basis the and yorke proof that any dimensional system that exhibits regular cycle period three will also display regular cycles every other length well completely chaotic strange attractors lorenz attractor some dynamical like the dimensional logistic map defined are chaotic but many cases chaotic behavior found only subset phase the cases most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place attractor since then large set initial conditions will lead orbits that converge this chaotic easy way visualize chaotic attractor start with point the basin attraction the and then simply plot its subsequent because the topological transitivity this likely produce picture the entire final and indeed both orbits shown the figure the right give picture the general shape the lorenz this attractor results from simple dimensional model the lorenz weather the lorenz attractor perhaps one the known chaotic system probably because was not only one the but also one the most complex and such gives rise very interesting that with little looks like the wings unlike fixed point attractors and limit cycles the attractors that arise from chaotic known strange attractors have great detail and strange attractors occur both continuous dynamical systems such the lorenz and some discrete systems such the non map other discrete dynamical systems have repelling structure called julia set which forms the boundary between basins attraction fixed points julia sets can thought strange repellers both strange attractors and julia sets typically have fractal structure and the fractal dimension can calculated for minimum complexity chaotic system bifurcation diagram logistic map doubling discrete chaotic such the logistic can exhibit strange attractors whatever their dimensionality for continuous dynamical the poincar bendixson theorem shows that strange attractor can only arise three more finite dimensional linear systems are never for dynamical system display chaotic has either nonlinear the poincar bendixson theorem states that dimensional differential equation has very regular the lorenz attractor discussed above generated system three differential equations such where and make the system state and are the system parameters five the terms the right hand side are while two are total seven another known chaotic attractor generated the rossler equations which have only one nonlinear term out sprott found dimensional system with just five that had only one nonlinear which exhibits chaos for certain parameter zhang and heidel showed least for dissipative and conservative quadratic three dimensional quadratic systems with only three four terms the hand side cannot exhibit chaotic the reason simply that solutions such systems are asymptotic dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well while the bendixson theorem shows that continuous dynamical system the euclidean plane cannot two dimensional continuous systems with non euclidean geometry can exhibit chaotic perhaps chaos may occur also linear provided they are infinite theory linear chaos being developed branch mathematical analysis known functional analysis spontaneous order under the right conditions chaos will spontaneously evolve into lockstep the kuramoto model four conditions suffice produce synchronization chaotic examples include the coupled oscillation christiaan huygens pendulums fireflies neurons the london millenium bridge resonance and large arrays josephson junctions history barnsley fern chaos game iterated function system early proponent chaos theory was henri the while studying the three body problem found that there can orbits that are and yet not forever increasing nor approaching fixed jacques hadamard published influential study the chaotic motion free particle gliding frictionlessly surface constant negative called hadamard billiards hadamard was able show that all trajectories are that all particle trajectories diverge exponentially from one with positive lyapunov exponent chaos theory got its start the field ergodic theory later also the topic nonlinear differential equations were carried out george david birkhoff andrey nikolaevich kolmogorov mary lucy cartwright and john edensor littlewood and stephen smale except for these studies were all directly inspired the body problem the case turbulence and astronomical problems the case and radio engineering the case cartwright and citation needed although chaotic planetary motion had not been experimentalists had encountered turbulence fluid motion and nonperiodic oscillation radio circuits without the benefit theory explain what they were despite initial insights the first half the twentieth chaos theory became formalized such only after when first became evident some scientists that linear theory the prevailing system theory that simply could not explain the observed behavior certain experiments like that the logistic map what had been attributed measure imprecision and simple noise was considered chaos theorists full component the studied the main catalyst for the development chaos theory was the electronic much the mathematics chaos theory involves the repeated iteration simple mathematical which would impractical electronic computers made these repeated calculations while figures and images made possible visualize these graduate student chihiro hayashi laboratory kyoto yoshisuke ueda was experimenting with analog computers and what called randomly transitional yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions the and did not allow him report his findings until turbulence tip vortex airplane soviet physicist lev landau hopf theory turbulence david ruelle floris takens fluid turbulence strange attractor early pioneer the theory was edward lorenz whose interest chaos came about accidentally through his work weather prediction lorenz was using simple digital royal mcbee lgp run his weather wanted see sequence data again and save time started the simulation the middle its was able this entering printout the data corresponding conditions the middle his simulation which had calculated last his surprise the weather that the machine began predict was completely different from the weather calculated lorenz tracked this down the computer the computer worked with digit but the printout rounded variables off digit value like was printed this difference tiny and the consensus the time would have been that should have had practically however lorenz had discovered that small changes initial conditions produced large changes the term lorenz which gave its name lorenz attractors showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling make precise term weather beno mandelbrot found recurring patterns every scale data cotton beforehand had studied information theory and concluded noise was patterned like cantor set any scale the proportion containing periods free periods was constant thus errors were inevitable and must planned for incorporating mandelbrot described both the noah which sudden discontinuous changes can and the joseph which persistence value can occur for yet suddenly change this challenged the idea that changes price were normally distributed published how long the coast statistical similarity and fractional dimension showing that length varies with the scale the measuring resembles itself all and infinite length for infinitesimally small measuring arguing that ball twine appears point when viewed from far away ball when viewed from fairly near curved strand argued that the dimensions object are relative the observer and may object whose irregularity constant over different scales fractal examples include the menger sponge the sierpi ski gasket and the koch curve snowflake which infinitely long yet encloses finite space and has fractal dimension circa mandelbrot published the fractal geometry nature which became classic chaos biological systems such the branching the circulatory and bronchial systems proved fit fractal december the new york academy sciences organized the first symposium attended david robert may james yorke coiner the term chaos used robert shaw and the meteorologist edward the following independently pierre coullet and charles tresser with the article iterations endomorphismes groupe and mitchell feigenbaum with the article quantitative universality for class nonlinear described logistic they notably discovered the universality permitting application chaos theory many different albert libchaber during symposium organized aspen pierre hohenberg presented his experimental observation the bifurcation cascade that leads chaos

institute mental health and the office naval research the first important conference chaos biology and there bernardo huberman presented mathematical model the eye tracking disorder among schizophrenics this led renewal physiology the through the application chaos for the study pathological cardiac cycles per bak chao tang and kurt wiesenfeld published paper physical review letters describing for the first time self organized criticality considered one the mechanisms which complexity arises alongside largely based approaches such the bak wiesenfeld sandpile many other investigations have focused scale natural social systems that are known display scale invariant behavior although these approaches were not always welcomed least specialists the subjects soc has nevertheless become established strong candidate for explaining number natural including earthquakes long before soc was were known source invariant behavior such the gutenberg richter law describing the statistical distribution earthquake and the omori law describing the frequency solar flares fluctuations economic systems such financial markets references soc are common econophysics landscape formation forest fires landslides epidemics and biological evolution where soc has been for the dynamical mechanism behind the theory punctuated equilibria put forward niles eldredge and stephen jay gould given the implications free distribution event some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should considered example soc the occurrence wars these investigations soc have included both attempts modelling either developing new models adapting existing ones the specifics given natural and extensive data analysis determine the existence characteristics natural scaling the same james gleick published chaos making new science which became seller and introduced the general principles chaos theory well its history the broad though his history emphasized important soviet initially the domain isolated chaos theory progressively emerged transdisciplinary and institutional mainly under the name nonlinear systems analysis alluding thomas kuhn concept paradigm shift exposed the structure scientific revolutions many chaologists some described claimed that this new theory was example such thesis upheld the availability more powerful computers broadens the applicability chaos currently chaos theory continues very active area involving many different disciplines mathematics topology physics social systems population modeling biology meteorology astrophysics information theory computational neuroscience etc distinguishing random from chaotic data can difficult tell from data whether physical other observed process random because practice time series consists pure signal there will always some form corrupting even present off truncation thus any real time even mostly will contain some all methods for distinguishing deterministic and stochastic processes rely the fact that deterministic system always evolves the same way from given starting thus given time series test for one can pick test state search the time series for similar nearby and compare their respective time evolutions define the error the difference between the time evolution the test state and the time evolution the nearby deterministic system will have error that either remains small regular increases exponentially with time stochastic system will have randomly distributed essentially all measures determinism taken from time series rely upon finding the closest states given test state correlation lyapunov etc define the state one typically relies phase space embedding typically one chooses embedding dimension and investigates the propagation the error between two nearby the error looks one increases the the dimension can increased obtain deterministically looking then analysis though may sound one complication that the dimension the search for nearby state requires lot more computation time and lot data the amount data required increases exponentially with embedding find suitably close the embedding dimension number measures per chosen too small less than the true value deterministic data can appear but theory there problem choosing the dimension too large the method will when nonlinear deterministic system attended external its trajectories present serious and permanent furthermore the noise amplified due the inherent nonlinearity and reveals totally new dynamical statistical tests attempting separate noise from the deterministic skeleton inversely isolate the deterministic part risk things become worse when the deterministic component nonlinear feedback presence interactions between nonlinear deterministic components and the resulting nonlinear series can display dynamics that traditional tests for nonlinearity are sometimes not able the question how distinguish deterministic chaotic systems from stochastic systems has also been discussed has been shown that they might observationally applications this section appears contain unverifiable speculation and unjustified claims information must

build predictive model biology for over hundred biologists have been keeping track populations different species with population models most models are deterministic systems but recently scientists have been able implement chaotic models certain for study models canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior the population chaos can also found ecological such hydrology while chaotic model for hydrology has its there still much learned from looking the data through the lens chaos another biological application found cardiotocography fetal surveillance delicate balance obtaining accurate information while being noninvasive better models warning signs fetal hypoxia can obtained through chaotic other areas predicting gas solubility essential manufacturing polymers but models using particle swarm optimization tend converge the wrong improved version pso has been created introducing which keeps the simulations from getting celestial mechanics especially when observing applying chaos theory leads better predictions about when these objects will come range earth and other quantum physics and electrical engineering the study large arrays josephson junctions benefitted greatly from chaos closer coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many until there was reliable way predict when they would but these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies when properly can predicted fairly chaos theory can applied outside the natural adapting model career counseling include chaotic interpretation the relationship between employees and the job better suggestions can made people struggling with career possible that economic models can also improved through application chaos but predicting the health economic system and what factors influence most extremely complex economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those the physical and natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic they result from the interactions and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely provide accurate representations the the empirical literature that tests for chaos economics and finance presents very mixed part due confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for linear traffic forecasting another area that greatly benefits from applications chaos better predictions when traffic will occur would allow measures taken for dispersed before the traffic rather than combining chaos theory principles with few other methods has led more accurate term prediction cultural references this section
