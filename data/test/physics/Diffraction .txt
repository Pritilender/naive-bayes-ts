diffraction navigation search laser diffraction refers various phenomena which occur when wave encounters obstacle classical the diffraction phenomenon described the interference waves according the huygens fresnel principle these characteristic behaviors are exhibited when wave encounters obstacle slit that comparable size its similar effects occur when light wave travels through medium with varying refractive index when sound wave travels through medium with varying acoustic impedance diffraction occurs with all including sound water waves and electromagnetic waves such visible light rays and radio waves since physical objects have like properties the atomic diffraction also occurs with matter and can studied according the principles quantum mechanics italian scientist francesco maria grimaldi coined the word diffraction and was the first record accurate observations the phenomenon while diffraction occurs whenever propagating waves encounter such its effects are generally most pronounced for waves whose wavelength roughly comparable the dimensions the diffracting object the obstructing object provides closely spaced complex pattern varying intensity can this due the interference different parts wave that travels the observer different where different path lengths result different phases see diffraction grating the formalism diffraction can also describe the way which waves finite extent propagate free for the expanding profile laser the beam shape radar antenna and the field view ultrasonic transducer can all analyzed using diffraction contents examples

everyday the most striking examples diffraction are those that involve for the closely spaced tracks dvd act diffraction grating form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking this principle can extended engineer grating with structure such that will produce any diffraction pattern the hologram credit card diffraction the atmosphere small particles can cause bright ring visible around bright light source like the sun the shadow solid using light from compact shows small fringes near its the speckle pattern which observed when laser light falls optically rough surface also diffraction when deli meat appears iridescent that diffraction off the meat all these effects are consequence the fact that light propagates wave diffraction can occur with any kind ocean waves diffract around jetties and other sound waves can diffract around which why one can still hear someone calling even when hiding behind diffraction can also concern some technical sets fundamental limit the resolution telescope history the effects diffraction light were first carefully observed and characterized francesco maria grimaldi who also coined the term diffraction from the latin diffringere break into referring light breaking into different the results observations were published posthumously isaac newton studied these effects and attributed them inflexion light james gregory observed the diffraction patterns caused bird which was effectively the first diffraction grating thomas young performed celebrated experiment demonstrating interference from two closely spaced explaining his results interference the waves emanating from the two different deduced that light must propagate augustin jean fresnel did more definitive studies and calculations made public and and thereby gave great support the wave theory light that had been advanced christiaan huygens and reinvigorated against particle mechanism ripple tank diffraction arises because the way which waves this described the huygens fresnel principle and the principle superposition waves the propagation wave can visualized considering every particle the transmitted medium wavefront point source for secondary spherical wave the wave displacement any subsequent point the sum these secondary when waves are added their sum determined the relative phases well the amplitudes the individual waves that the summed amplitude the waves can have any value between zero and the sum the individual hence diffraction patterns usually have series maxima and there are various analytical models which allow the diffracted field including the kirchhoff fresnel diffraction equation which derived from wave equation the fraunhofer diffraction approximation the kirchhoff equation which applies the far field and the fresnel diffraction approximation which applies the near field most configurations cannot solved but can yield numerical solutions through finite element and boundary element methods possible obtain qualitative understanding many diffraction phenomena considering how the relative phases the individual secondary wave sources and the conditions which the phase difference equals half cycle which case waves will cancel one another the simplest descriptions diffraction are those which the situation can reduced dimensional for water this already the water waves propagate only the surface the for can often neglect one direction the diffracting object extends that direction over distance far greater than the the case light shining through small circular holes will have take into account the full dimensional nature the quantum mechanics remarkable fact that the mechanism diffraction based radiating particles while quantum mechanical waves have transmitting being part the wave particle duality this has physical diffraction light some examples diffraction light are considered single slit diffraction diffraction formalism long slit infinitesimal width which illuminated light diffracts the light into series circular waves and the wavefront which emerges from the slit cylindrical wave uniform slit which wider than wavelength produces interference effects the space downstream the these can explained assuming that the slit behaves though has large number point sources spaced evenly across the width the the analysis this system simplified consider light single the incident light these sources all have the same light incident given point the space downstream the slit made contributions from each these point sources and the relative phases these contributions vary may expect find minima and maxima the diffracted such phase differences are caused differences the path lengths over which contributing rays reach the point from the can find the angle which first minimum obtained the diffracted light the following the light from source located the top edge the slit interferes destructively with source located the middle the when the path difference between them equal similarly the source just below the top the slit will interfere destructively with the source located just below the middle the slit the same can continue this reasoning along the entire height the slit conclude that the condition for destructive interference for the entire slit the same the condition for destructive interference between two narrow slits distance apart that half the width the the path difference given that the minimum intensity occurs angle given where the width the the angle incidence which the minimum intensity and the wavelength the light similar argument can used show that imagine the slit divided into six eight etc minima are obtained angles given where integer other than there such simple argument enable find the maxima the diffraction the intensity profile can calculated using the fraunhofer diffraction equation where the intensity given the original and the unnormalized sinc function above given sin and this analysis applies only the far field that distance much larger than the width the diffraction grating diffraction grating diffraction grating optical component with regular the form the light diffracted grating depends the structure the elements and the number elements but all gratings have intensity maxima angles which are given the grating equation where the angle which the light the separation grating and integer which can positive the light diffracted grating found summing the light diffracted from each the and essentially convolution diffraction and interference the figure shows the light diffracted element and element gratings where the grating spacings are the can seen that the maxima are the same but the detailed structures the intensities are airy disk circular aperture airy disk the field diffraction plane wave incident circular aperture often referred the airy disk the variation intensity with angle given where the radius the circular equal and bessel function the smaller the the larger the spot size given and the greater the divergence the diffracted general aperture the wave that emerges from point source has amplitude location that given the solution the frequency domain wave equation for point source the helmholtz equation where the dimensional delta the delta function has only radial the laplace operator aka scalar the spherical coordinate system simplifies see del cylindrical and spherical coordinates direct the solution this equation can readily shown the scalar green function which the spherical coordinate system and using the physics time convention this solution assumes that the delta function source located the the source located arbitrary source denoted the vector and the field point located the point then may represent the scalar green function for arbitrary source therefore electric incident the the field produced this aperture distribution given the surface integral where the source point the aperture given the vector the far wherein the parallel rays approximation can the simplifies can seen the figure the right click the expression for the zone fraunhofer field becomes since and the expression for the fraunhofer region field from planar aperture now letting and the fraunhofer region field the planar aperture assumes the form fourier transform the field fraunhofer this becomes the spatial fourier transform the aperture huygens principle when applied aperture simply says that the far field diffraction pattern the spatial fourier transform the aperture and this direct product using the rays which identical doing plane wave decomposition the aperture plane fields see fourier optics propagation laser beam the way which the profile laser beam changes propagates determined the output mirror the laser and the subsequent beam shape determined that hence the smaller the output the quicker paradoxically possible reduce the divergence laser beam first expanding with one convex lens and then collimating with second convex lens whose focal point coincident with that the first the resulting beam has larger and hence lower diffraction limited imaging diffraction limited system lucky image binary star zeta tis the ability imaging system resolve detail ultimately limited diffraction this because plane wave incident circular lens mirror diffracted described the light not focused point but forms airy disk having central spot the focal plane with radius first null where the wavelength the light and the number focal length divided the imaging object the corresponding angular resolution where the diameter the entrance pupil the imaging lens main two point sources will each produce airy pattern see the photo binary the point sources move closer the patterns will start and ultimately they will merge form single which case the two point sources cannot resolved the the rayleigh criterion specifies that two point sources can considered resolvable the separation the two images least the radius the airy the first minimum one coincides with the maximum the thus the larger the aperture the and the smaller the the finer the resolution imaging this why telescopes have very large lenses and why optical microscopes are limited the detail which they can speckle patterns speckle pattern the speckle pattern which seen when using laser pointer another diffraction result the superposition many waves with different which are produced when laser beam illuminates rough they add together give resultant wave whose and therefore intensity varies babinet principle babinet principle principle useful theorem stating that the diffraction pattern from opaque body identical that from hole the same size and but with differing this means that the interference conditions single obstruction would the same that single patterns several qualitative observations can made diffraction the angular spacing the features the diffraction pattern inversely proportional the dimensions the object causing the other the smaller the diffracting the the resulting diffraction and vice more this true the sines the the diffraction angles are invariant under that they depend only the ratio the wavelength the size the diffracting when the diffracting object has periodic for example diffraction the features generally become the third for shows comparison double slit pattern with pattern formed five both sets slits having the same between the center one slit and the particle diffraction neutron diffraction electron diffraction quantum theory tells that every particle exhibits wave massive particles can interfere and therefore diffraction electrons and neutrons stood one the powerful arguments favor quantum the wavelength associated with particle the broglie wavelength where planck constant and the momentum the particle mass velocity for moving for most macroscopic this wavelength short that not meaningful assign wavelength sodium atom traveling about would have broglie wavelength about pico because the wavelength for even the smallest macroscopic objects extremely diffraction matter waves only visible for small like neutrons atoms and small the short wavelength these matter waves makes them ideally suited study the atomic crystal structure solids and large molecules like relatively larger molecules like buckyballs were also shown bragg diffraction bragg law reflection bragg diffraction diffraction from dimensional periodic structure such atoms crystal called bragg diffraction similar what occurs when waves are scattered from diffraction bragg diffraction consequence interference between waves reflecting from different crystal the condition constructive interference given bragg law where order bragg diffraction may carried out using either light very short wavelength like rays matter waves like neutrons and electrons whose wavelength the order much smaller the atomic the pattern produced gives information the separations crystallographic planes allowing one deduce the crystal diffraction electron microscopes and topography devices also powerful tool for examining individual defects and local strain fields coherence coherence the description diffraction relies the interference waves emanating from the same source taking different paths the same point this the difference phase between waves that took different paths only dependent the effective path this does not take into account the fact that waves that arrive the screen the same time were emitted the source different the initial phase with which the source emits waves can change over time unpredictable this means that waves emitted the source times that are too far apart can longer form constant interference pattern since the relation between their phases longer time the length over which the phase beam light called the coherence length order for interference the path length difference must smaller than the coherence this sometimes referred spectral related the presence different frequency components the the case light emitted atomic transition the coherence length related the lifetime the excited state from which the atom made its waves are emitted from extended this can lead incoherence the transversal when looking cross section beam the length over which the phase correlated called the transverse coherence the case double slit this would mean that the transverse coherence length smaller than the spacing between the two the resulting pattern screen would look like two single slit diffraction the case particles like neutrons and the coherence length related the
