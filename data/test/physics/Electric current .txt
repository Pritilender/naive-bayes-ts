ions flowing one and negative sulfate ions flowing the electric currents sparks plasma are flows electrons well positive and negative ice and certain solid the electric current entirely composed flowing metals solid conductive metal contains free electrons which function conduction electrons these electrons are bound the metal lattice but longer individual metals are particularly conductive because there are large number these free typically one per atom the even with external electric field applied these electrons move about randomly due thermal energy but there zero net current within the room the average speed these random motions metres per given surface through which metal wire electrons move both directions across the surface equal george gamow wrote his popular science book

bands each correspond large number discrete quantum states the and most the states with low energy closer the are particular band called the valence band semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band any given metal nearly filled with electrons under usual operating while very few virtually none them are available the conduction band the band immediately above the valence the ease with which electrons the semiconductor can excited from the valence band the conduction band depends the band gap between the the size this energy bandgap serves arbitrary dividing line roughly between semiconductors and insulators with covalent electron moves hopping neighboring the pauli exclusion principle requires the electron lifted into the higher bonding state that for delocalized for example one dimension that nanowire for every energy there state with electrons flowing one direction and another state with the electrons flowing the for net
