physics has been known that some materials such amber attract lightweight particles after rubbing the greek word for electron was the source the word electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert each such forces are described coulomb law even though electrostatically induced forces seem rather the electrostatic force between electron and proton that together make hydrogen atom about orders magnitude stronger than the gravitational force acting between there are many examples electrostatic from those simple the attraction the plastic wrap your hand after you remove from the apparently spontaneous explosion grain damage electronic components during the operation electrostatics involves the buildup charge the surface objects due contact with other although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and the effects charge exchange are usually only noticed when least one the surfaces has high resistance electrical this because the charges that transfer from the highly resistive surface are more less trapped there for long enough time for their effects these charges then remain the object until they either bleed off ground are quickly

very slowly some both electrostatics and magnetostatics may required for accurate but the coupling between the two can still electrostatic potential because the electric field irrotational possible express the electric field the gradient scalar called the electrostatic potential also known the voltage electric points from regions high electric potential regions low electric expressed mathematically the gradient theorem can used establish that the electrostatic potential the amount work per unit charge required move charge from point point the following line integral from these see that the electric potential constant any region for which the electric field vanishes such occurs inside conducting electrostatic energy electric potential energy energy density single test particle

materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with different material and then one the materials acquires positive and the other acquires equal negative the polarity and strength the charges produced differ according the surface temperature strain and other amber for can acquire electric charge friction with material like this first recorded thales miletus was the first electrical phenomenon investigated other examples materials that can acquire significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with and hard rubber rubbed with electrostatic generators electrostatic generator the presence surface charge imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive repulsive this surface charge which yields static can generated touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due the phenomena contact electrification and the triboelectric effect rubbing two nonconductive objects generates great amount static this not just the result two nonconductive surfaces can become charged just being placed one top the since most surfaces have rough takes longer achieve charging through contact than through rubbing objects together increases amount adhesive contact between the two usually insulators substances that not conduct are good both and surface some examples these substances are rubber plastic glass and pith conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance for when metal surface impacted solid liquid the charge that transferred during contact electrification stored the surface each static electric generators devices which produce very high voltage very low current and used for classroom physics rely this note that the presence electric current does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the from the corona discharge other both phenomena can exist simultaneously the same friction machines wimshurst machines van graaff generators charge neutralization natural electrostatic

balloon will stick the wall attractive force exerted two oppositely charged surfaces the surface the wall gains electric charge due charge the free electrons the surface the wall are repelled the negative creating positive wall which subsequently attracted the surface the you can explore the effect with simulation the balloon and static electricity static electricity lightning oradea romania before the year when michael faraday published the results his experiment the identity physicists thought static was somehow different from other electrical michael faraday proved that the electricity induced from the voltaic electricity produced and static electricity are all the static electricity usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each like wool plastic the soles shoes the process causes electrons pulled from the surface one material and relocated the surface the other static shock occurs when the surface the second negatively charged with touches charged static electricity commonly used xerography air filters and some automotive static electricity buildup electric charges two objects that have become separated from each small electrical components can easily damaged static component manufacturers use number antistatic devices avoid static electricity and chemical industry when different materials are brought together and then accumulation electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively the mild shock that you receive when touching grounded object after walking carpet example excess electrical charge accumulating your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the the resulting charge upon your body can generate strong electrical although experimenting with static electricity may similar sparks create severe hazards those industries dealing with flammable where small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through process called flow fluids which have low electrical conductivity below picosiemens per are called fluids having conductivities above are called charges recombine fast they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation not the petrochemical the recommended minimum value electrical conductivity for adequate removal charge from important concept for insulating fluids the static relaxation this similar the time constant within circuit for insulating the ratio the static dielectric constant divided the electrical conductivity the for hydrocarbon
