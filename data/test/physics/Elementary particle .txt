unknown whether composed other known elementary particles include the fundamental fermions quarks leptons antiquarks and antileptons which generally are matter and antimatter particles well the fundamental bosons gauge bosons and higgs boson which generally are force that mediate interactions among particle containing two more elementary particles composite particle everyday matter composed atoms once presumed elementary atom meaning indivisible although the existence remained controversial until about some leading physicists regarded molecules mathematical and matter ultimately composed soon subatomic constituents the atom were the the electron and the proton had been along with the photon the particle electromagnetic radiation that the recent advent quantum mechanics was radically altering the conception single particle could seemingly span field would wave paradox still eluding satisfactory via quantum protons and neutrons were found contain quarks quarks and down quarks now considered elementary and within molecule the three degrees freedom charge spin orbital can separate via wavefunction into three quasiparticles holon spinon orbiton yet free not orbiting atomic nucleus lacks orbital motion appears unsplittable and remains regarded elementary around elementary status indeed ultimate constituent was mostly discarded for more practical embodied particle

output particle might not contain the input for instance matter creation from colliding photons likewise the composite fermions protons were collided nearly light speed produce higgs boson which elementary boson far more the most massive elementary the top quark rapidly decays into but apparently does not lighter when probed energies available particles exhibit spherical operating particle standard model elementary particles are usually represented for predictive utility point particles which lack spatial though extremely the standard model limited the microcosm its omission gravitation and has some parameters arbitrarily added but seeking resolve those string theory posits that elementary particles are ultimately composed dimensional energy strings whose absolute minimum size the planck length common elementary particles cosmic abundance elements according the current models big bang nucleosynthesis the primordial composition visible matter the universe should about hydrogen and helium neutrons are made one and two down while protons are made two and one down since the other common elementary particles such neutrinos weak are light rare when compared atomic can neglect their mass contribution the observable total therefore one can conclude that most the visible mass the universe made protons and which like all baryons are turn made quarks and down some estimates imply that there are roughly baryons almost entirely protons and the observable the number protons the observable universe called the eddington number terms number some estimates imply that nearly all the excluding dark matter occurs and that roughly elementary particles matter exist the visible mostly other estimates imply that roughly elementary particles exist the visible universe not including dark matter mostly gravitons and other massless force standard model standard model the standard model particle physics contains flavors elementary fermions plus their corresponding antiparticles well elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the higgs boson which was reported july having been likely detected the two main experiments the lhc atlas and cms however the standard model widely considered provisional theory rather than truly fundamental since not known compatible with einstein general relativity there may hypothetical elementary particles not described the standard such the graviton the particle that would carry the gravitational force and sparticles supersymmetric partners the ordinary fundamental fermions fermion the fundamental fermionic flavours are divided into three generations four particles six the particles are quarks the remaining six are leptons three which are neutrinos and the remaining three which have electric charge the electron and its two the muon and the tau particle generations leptons first generation second generation third generation name symbol name symbol name symbol electron muon tau electron neutrino muon neutrino tau neutrino quarks first generation second generation third generation quark charm quark top quark down quark strange quark bottom quark antiparticles antimatter there are also fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond these particles for the antielectron the antiparticle and has electric charge particle generations antileptons first generation second generation third generation name symbol name

antiquark down antiquark strange antiquark bottom antiquark quarks quark isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been fact explained confinement every quark carries one three color charges the strong interaction antiquarks similarly carry color charged particles interact via gluon exchange the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange however gluons are themselves resulting amplification the strong force charged particles are unlike the electromagnetic force which diminishes charged particles color charged particles feel increasing however color charged particles may combine form color neutral composite particles called hadrons quark may pair with the quark has color and the antiquark has the corresponding the color and anticolor cancel forming color neutral meson alternatively three quarks can exist one quark being red another blue another green these three colored quarks together form neutral baryon symmetrically three antiquarks with the colors antired antiblue and antigreen can form neutral antibaryon quarks also carry fractional electric charges but since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all fractional charges have never been note that quarks have electric charges either whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges either evidence for the existence quarks comes from deep inelastic scattering firing electrons nuclei determine the distribution charge within nucleons which are the charge the electric field around the proton should uniform and the electron should scatter low energy electrons scatter this but above particular the protons deflect some electrons through large the recoiling electron has much less energy and jet particles this inelastic scattering suggests that the charge the proton not uniform but split among smaller charged quarks fundamental bosons boson the standard vector spin bosons gluons photons and the and bosons mediate whereas the higgs boson responsible for the intrinsic mass bosons differ from fermions the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state pauli exclusion principle also bosons can either like like mesons the spin bosons are integers instead half gluons gluon gluons mediate the strong interaction which join quarks and thereby form hadrons which are either baryons three mesons one quark and one protons and neutrons are joined gluons form the atomic nucleus like gluons exhibit colour and unrelated the concept visual sometimes altogether eight variations electroweak bosons and bosons photon there are three weak gauge bosons and these mediate the weak interaction the bosons are known for their mediation nuclear the converts neutron into proton then decay into electron and electron antineutrino the does not convert charge but rather changes momentum and the only mechanism for elastically scattering the weak gauge bosons were discovered due momentum change electrons from the massless photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction these four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary higgs boson higgs boson although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different everyday the two forces are theorized unify single electroweak force high this prediction was clearly confirmed measurements sections for energy proton scattering the hera collider desy the differences low energies consequence the high masses the and bosons which turn are consequence the higgs mechanism through the process spontaneous symmetry breaking the higgs selects special direction electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles become very heavy the weak and one remain massless the july after many years experimentally searching for evidence its the higgs boson was announced have been observed large hadron peter higgs who first posited the existence the higgs boson was present the the higgs boson believed have mass approximately gev the statistical significance this discovery was reported which implies certainty roughly particle this the level significance required officially label experimental observations discovery research into the properties the newly discovered particle graviton graviton the graviton hypothesized mediate but remains undiscovered and yet sometimes included tables elementary its spin would thus and would lack charge besides mediating extremely feeble the graviton would have its own antiparticle and rapidly rendering its detection extremely difficult even beyond the standard model although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the standard model some its parameters were added not determined particular which remain for instance the hierarchy problem theories beyond the standard model attempt resolve these grand unification grand unified theory one extension the standard model attempts combine the electroweak interaction with the strong interaction into single grand unified such force would spontaneously broken into the three forces higgs like mechanism the most dramatic prediction grand unification the existence and bosons which cause proton decay however the observation proton decay the super kamiokande neutrino observatory rules out the simplest including and supersymmetry supersymmetry supersymmetry extends the standard model adding additional class symmetries the lagrangian these symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic ones such symmetry predicts the existence supersymmetric particles abbreviated sparticles which include the sleptons squarks neutralinos and charginos each particle the standard model would have superpartner whose spin differs from the ordinary due the breaking supersymmetry the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary they are heavy that existing particle colliders would not powerful enough produce however some physicists believe that sparticles will detected the large hadron collider cern string theory string theory string theory model physics where all particles that make matter are composed strings measuring the planck that exist dimensional according theory the leading universe these strings vibrate different frequencies that determine electric color and string can open closed loop dimensional like string moves through space sweeps out something called world sheet string theory predicts branes brane being string and brane being dimensional that prevent tears the fabric space using the uncertainty principle the electron orbiting hydrogen atom has the albeit that could anywhere else the universe any given string theory proposes that our universe merely inside which exist the space dimensions and the time dimension that the remaining theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled and too small affect our universe any simply cannot exist our universe because they exist grander scheme called the multiverse outside our known some predictions the string theory include existence extremely massive counterparts ordinary particles due vibrational excitations the fundamental string and existence massless particle behaving like the graviton technicolor technicolor technicolor theories try modify the standard model minimal way introducing new like this means one adds new theory called interacting via called the main idea that the boson not elementary particle but bound state these preon theory preon according preon theory there are one more orders particles more fundamental than those most found the standard the most fundamental these are normally called which derived from preon theory tries for the standard model what the standard model did for the particle zoo that came before most models assume that almost everything the standard model can explained terms three half dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interest preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out the acceleron theory accelerons are the hypothetical
