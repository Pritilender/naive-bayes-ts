fluid dynamics are the conservation laws specifically conservation mass conservation linear momentum also known newton second law motion and conservation energy also known first law thermodynamics these are based classical mechanics and are modified quantum mechanics and general relativity they are expressed using the reynolds transport theorem addition the fluids are assumed obey the continuum assumption fluids are composed molecules that collide with one another and solid however the continuum assumption considers fluids rather than consequently properties such pressure temperature and velocity are taken defined infinitesimally small and are assumed vary continuously from one point the fact that the fluid made discrete molecules for fluids which are sufficiently dense not contain ionized and have velocities small relation the speed the momentum equations for newtonian fluids are the navier stokes equations which non linear set differential equations that describes the flow fluid whose stress depends linearly velocity gradients and the unsimplified equations not have general closed form solution they are primarily use computational fluid dynamics the equations can simplified number all which make them easier some them allow appropriate fluid dynamics problems solved closed citation needed addition the momentum and energy conservation thermodynamical equation

molar mass and temperature conservation laws three conservation laws are used solve fluid dynamics and may written integral differential form mathematical formulations these conservation laws may interpreted considering the concept control volume control volume specified volume space through which air can flow and integral formulations the conservation laws consider the change momentum energy within the control differential formulations the conservation laws apply stokes theorem yield expression which may interpreted the integral form the law applied infinitesimal volume point within the mass continuity conservation the rate change fluid mass inside control volume must equal the net rate fluid flow into the physically this statement requires that mass neither created nor destroyed the control and can translated into the integral form the continuity divergence theorem conservation momentum this equation applies newton second law motion the control requiring that any change momentum the air within control volume due the net flow air into the volume and the action external forces the air within the the integral formulation this body forces here are represented the body force per unit surface forces such viscous are represented the net force due stresses the control volume newtonian fluid citation needed conservation energy although energy can converted from one form the total energy given closed system remains enthalpy thermal conductivity second law thermodynamics material derivative compressible incompressible flow all fluids are compressible some that changes pressure temperature will result changes however many situations the changes pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes density are this case the flow can modelled incompressible flow otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must mathematically incompressibility expressed saying that the density fluid parcel does not change moves the flow where the substantial derivative which the sum local and convective derivatives this additional constraint simplifies the governing especially the case when the fluid has uniform for flow determine whether use compressible incompressible fluid the mach number the flow rough compressible effects can ignored mach numbers below approximately for whether the incompressible assumption valid depends the fluid properties specifically the critical pressure and temperature the and the flow conditions how close the critical pressure the actual flow pressure acoustic problems always require allowing since sound waves are compression waves involving changes pressure and density the medium through which they viscous inviscid flow viscous problems are those which fluid friction has significant effects the fluid the reynolds number which ratio between inertial and viscous can used evaluate whether viscous inviscid equations are appropriate the stokes flow flow very low reynolds such that inertial forces can neglected compared viscous the high reynolds numbers indicate that the inertial forces are more significant than the viscous forces therefore may assume the flow inviscid flow approximation which neglect viscosity completely compared inertial this idea can work fairly well when the reynolds number however certain problems such those involving solid may require that the viscosity viscosity often cannot neglected near solid boundaries because the slip condition can generate thin region large strain rate known boundary layer which enhances the effect even small amount viscosity and thus generating vorticity therefore calculate net forces bodies such should use viscous flow illustrated paradox body inviscid fluid will experience drag the standard equations inviscid flow are the euler equations another often used especially computational fluid use the euler equations away from the body and the boundary layer equations which incorporates region close the the euler equations can integrated along streamline get bernoulli equation when the flow everywhere irrotational and bernoulli equation can used throughout the flow such flows are called potential flows steady unsteady flow rayleigh taylor instability when all the time derivatives flow field the flow considered steady flow steady state flow refers the condition where the fluid properties point the system not change over otherwise flow called unsteady also called transient whether particular flow steady can depend the chosen frame reference for laminar flow over sphere steady the frame reference that stationary with respect the frame reference that stationary with respect background the flow turbulent flows are unsteady turbulent flow however statistically stationary according the random field statistically stationary all statistics are invariant under shift this roughly means that all statistical properties are constant often the mean field the object and this constant too statistically stationary steady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady the governing equations steady problem have one dimension fewer than the governing equations the same problem without taking advantage the steadiness the flow laminar turbulent flow turbulence flow characterized eddies and apparent randomness flow which turbulence not exhibited called laminar should however that the presence eddies recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent these phenomena may present laminar flow mathematically turbulent flow often represented via reynolds decomposition which the flow broken down into the sum average component and perturbation believed that turbulent flows can described well through the use the navier stokes equations direct numerical simulation based the stokes makes possible simulate turbulent flows moderate reynolds restrictions depend the power the computer used and the efficiency the solution the results dns have been found agree well with experimental data for some most flows interest have reynolds numbers much too high for dns viable given the state computational power for the next few any flight vehicle large enough carry human moving faster than well beyond the limit dns simulation million transport aircraft wings such airbus boeing have reynolds numbers million based the wing order solve these life flow turbulence models will necessity for the foreseeable reynolds averaged stokes equations combined with turbulence modelling provides model the effects the turbulent such modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer the reynolds stresses although the turbulence also enhances the heat and mass transfer another promising methodology large eddy simulation especially the guise detached eddy simulation which combination rans turbulence modelling and large eddy newtonian newtonian fluids sir isaac newton showed how stress and the rate strain are very close linearly related for many familiar such water and air these newtonian fluids are modelled coefficient called viscosity which depends the specific however some the other such emulsions and slurries and some elastic materials blood some polymers have more complicated non newtonian stress strain these materials include sticky liquids such latex honey and lubricants which are studied the discipline rheology subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flows

viscous the shallow water equations can used describe layer relatively inviscid fluid with free surface which surface gradients are the boussinesq equations are applicable surface waves thicker layers fluid and with steeper surface slopes darcy law used for flow porous media and works with variables averaged over several rotating the quasi geostrophic equations assume almost perfect balance between pressure gradients and the coriolis force useful the study atmospheric dynamics terminology fluid dynamics the concept pressure central the study both fluid statics and fluid pressure can identified for every point body regardless whether the fluid motion pressure can measured using bourdon mercury various other some the terminology that necessary the study fluid dynamics not found other similar areas some the terminology used fluid dynamics not used fluid statics terminology incompressible fluid dynamics the concepts total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from bernoulli equation and are significant the study all fluid these two pressures are not pressures the usual they cannot measured using bourdon tube mercury avoid potential ambiguity when referring pressure fluid many authors use the term static pressure distinguish from total pressure and dynamic static pressure identical pressure and can identified for every point fluid flow aerodynamics clancy distinguish from the total and dynamic the actual pressure the which associated not with its motion but with its often referred the static but where the term pressure alone used refers this static point fluid flow where the flow has come rest speed equal zero adjacent some solid body immersed the fluid special such importance that given special stagnation point the static pressure the stagnation point special significance and given its own stagnation pressure incompressible the stagnation pressure stagnation point equal the total pressure throughout the flow terminology compressible fluid dynamics compressible such the temperature and density are essential when determining the state the addition the concept total pressure also known stagnation pressure the concepts total temperature and total density are also essential any study compressible fluid avoid potential ambiguity when referring temperature and many authors use the terms static temperature and static static temperature identical and static density identical and both can identified for every point fluid flow the temperature and density stagnation point are called stagnation temperature and stagnation similar approach also taken with the thermodynamic properties compressible many authors use the terms total enthalpy and total entropy the terms static enthalpy and static entropy appear less but where they are used they mean nothing more than enthalpy and entropy and the prefix static being used avoid ambiguity with their counterparts because the flow conditions are defined isentropically bringing the fluid the total entropy
