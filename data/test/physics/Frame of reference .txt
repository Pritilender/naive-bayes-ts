represent and measure properties such their position and orientation different moments time may also refer set axes used for such weaker reference frame does not specify but only defines the same dimensional space for all moments time such that the frame can distinguish objects rest from those that are moving einsteinian relativity reference frames are used specify the relationship between moving observer and the phenomenon phenomena under this the phrase often becomes observational frame reference observational reference frame which implies that the observer rest the although not necessarily located its origin relativistic reference frame includes the coordinate time which does not correspond across different frames moving relatively each the situation thus differs from galilean relativity where all possible coordinate times are essentially contents different aspects frame coordinate systems observational frames reference measurement apparatus examples inertial frames reference simple example additional example remarks non inertial frames particular frames reference common use other frames see also notes different aspects frame the need distinguish between the various meanings frame has led variety for sometimes the type coordinate system attached cartesian frame reference sometimes the state motion rotating frame reference sometimes the way transforms frames considered related emphasized galilean frame reference sometimes frames are distinguished the scale their macroscopic and microscopic frames reference this the term observational frame reference used when emphasis upon the state motion rather than upon the coordinate choice the character the observations observational this observational frame reference allows study the effect motion upon entire family coordinate systems that could attached this the other coordinate system may employed for many purposes where the state motion not the primary for coordinate system may adopted take advantage the symmetry still broader the formulation many problems physics employs generalized coordinates normal modes eigenvectors which are only indirectly related space and seems useful divorce the various aspects reference frame for the discussion therefore take observational frames coordinate and observational equipment independent separated observational frame such inertial frame non inertial frame reference physical concept related state coordinate system mathematical amounting choice language used describe consequently observer observational frame reference can choose employ any coordinate system polar curvilinear generalized describe observations made from that frame change the choice this coordinate system does not change state and does not entail change the observational frame this viewpoint can found elsewhere which not dispute that some coordinate systems may better choice for some observations than are choice what measure and with what observational apparatus matter separate from the state motion and choice coordinate here quotation applicable moving observational frames and various associated euclidean space coordinate systems etc reference frame observer coordinate system intrinsic this frame and this the utility separating the notions and etc and also the distinction between and etc spaces rest classes and from norton the discussion taken beyond simple time coordinate systems brading and extension coordinate systems using generalized coordinates underlies the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations quantum field theory classical relativistic mechanics and quantum gravity coordinate systems coordinate systems generalized coordinates axes conventions although the term coordinate often used particularly nontechnical the term coordinate does have precise meaning and sometimes that what the physicist means coordinate system mathematics facet geometry algebra property manifolds for configuration spaces phase spaces the coordinates point dimensional space are simply ordered set numbers general banach space these numbers could for coefficients functional expansion like fourier series physical they could spacetime coordinates normal mode amplitudes robot design they could angles relative linear deformations joints here will suppose these coordinates can related cartesian coordinate system set where etc are the cartesian coordinates the given these coordinate surfaces are defined the the intersection these surfaces define coordinate lines any selected tangents the intersecting coordinate lines that point define set basis vectors that that which can normalized unit for more detail see curvilinear coordinates coordinate coordinate and basis vectors are components coordinate system the basis vectors are orthogonal every the coordinate system orthogonal coordinate system important aspect coordinate system its metric tensor which determines the arc length the coordinate system terms its where repeated indices are summed apparent from these coordinate system mathematical construct part axiomatic system there necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion any other aspect however coordinate systems can include time and can used describe thus lorentz transformations and galilean transformations may viewed coordinate transformations general and specific topics coordinate systems can pursued following the see also links observational frames reference inertial frame reference observational frame reference often referred physical frame reference frame reference simply frame physical concept related observer and the state here adopt the view expressed kumar and observational frame reference characterized only its state motion however there lack unanimity this special the distinction sometimes made between observer and frame according this frame observer plus coordinate lattice constructed orthonormal handed set spacelike vectors perpendicular timelike see this restricted view not used and not universally adopted even discussions general relativity the use general coordinate systems common for the schwarzschild solution for the gravitational field outside isolated sphere there are two types observational reference inertial and non inertial inertial frame reference defined one which all laws physics take their simplest special relativity these frames are related lorentz transformations which are parametrized rapidity newtonian more restricted definition requires only that newton first law holds that newtonian inertial frame one which free particle travels straight line constant speed these frames are related galilean transformations these relativistic and newtonian transformations are expressed spaces general dimension terms representations the poincar group and the galilean group contrast the inertial inertial frame reference one which fictitious forces must invoked explain example observational frame reference centered point the this frame reference orbits around the center the which introduces the fictitious forces known the coriolis force centrifugal force and gravitational force all these forces including gravity disappear truly inertial reference which one measurement apparatus further aspect frame reference the role the measurement apparatus for clocks and attached the frame see norton quote this question not addressed this and particular interest quantum mechanics where the relation between observer and measurement still under discussion see measurement problem physics the frame reference which the laboratory measurement devices are rest usually referred the laboratory frame simply lab example would the frame which the detectors for particle accelerator are the lab frame some experiments inertial but not required for example the laboratory the surface the earth many physics experiments not particle physics often useful transform energies and momenta particles from the lab frame where they are the center momentum frame com which calculations are sometimes since potentially all kinetic energy still present the com frame may used for making new this connection may noted that the clocks and rods often used describe measurement equipment practice are replaced much more complicated and indirect metrology that connected the nature the vacuum and uses atomic clocks that operate according the standard model and that must corrected for gravitational time dilation see second meter and kilogram einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should replaced more fundamental entities based for atoms and examples inertial frames reference this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed july simple example consider situation common everyday two cars travel along both moving constant see some particular they are separated the car front travelling metres per second and the car behind travelling metres per want find out how long will take the second car catch with the there are three obvious frames that could first could observe the two cars from the side the define our frame stand the side the road and start clock the exact moment that the second car passes which happens when they are distance since neither the cars can determine their positions the following where the position meters car one after time seconds and the position car two after time notice that these formulas predict the first car down the road and the second car right beside want find the time which therefore set and solve for that alternatively could choose frame reference situated the first this the first car stationary and the second car approaching from behind speed order catch the first will take time that note how much easier the problem becomes choosing suitable frame the third possible frame reference would attached the second that example resembles the case just except the second car stationary and the first car moves backward towards would have been possible choose accelerating frame moving complicated but this would have served complicate the problem also necessary note that one able convert measurements made one coordinate system for suppose that your watch running five minutes fast compared the local standard you know that this the when somebody asks you what time you are able deduct five minutes from the time displayed your watch order obtain the correct the measurements that observer makes about system depend therefore the frame reference you might say that the bus arrived past when fact arrived additional example this factual accuracy disputed february for simple example involving only the orientation two consider two people facing each other either side south see figure car drives past them heading for the person facing the car was moving toward the however for the person facing the car was moving toward the this discrepancy because the two people used two different frames reference from which investigate this for more complex example involving observers relative consider who standing the side road watching car drive past him from left his frame alfred defines the spot where standing the the road the axis and the direction front him the positive the car moves along the axis with some velocity the positive alfred frame reference considered inertial frame reference because not accelerating ignoring effects such rotation and now consider the person driving the betsy choosing her frame defines her location the the direction her right the positive and the direction front her the positive this frame betsy who stationary and the world around her that moving for she drives past she observes him moving with velocity the negative she driving then north the positive she turns east becomes the positive finally example inertial assume candace accelerating her she passes alfred measures her acceleration and finds the negative assuming acceleration what acceleration does betsy velocity she inertial frame and she will find the acceleration the same alfred her frame the negative however she accelerating rate the negative direction other slowing she will find acceleration the negative direction smaller value than alfred has similarly she accelerating rate the positive direction speeding she will observe acceleration the negative larger value than frames reference are especially important special relativity because when frame reference moving some significant fraction the speed then the flow time that frame does not necessarily apply another the speed light considered the only true constant between moving frames remarks special theory relativity general theory relativity important note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames newton for employed universal explained the following suppose that you own two which both tick exactly the same you synchronize them that they both display exactly the same the two clocks are now separated and one clock fast moving traveling constant velocity towards the according these two clocks will still tick the same rate and will both show the same newton says that the rate time measured one frame reference should the same the rate time that there exists universal time and all other times all other frames reference will run the same rate this universal time irrespective their position and this concept time and simultaneity was later generalized einstein his special theory relativity where developed transformations between inertial frames reference based upon the universal nature physical laws and their economy expression lorentz transformations also important note that the definition inertial reference frame can extended beyond dimensional euclidean newton assumed euclidean but general relativity uses more general example why this let consider the geometry this free particle defined one rest traveling constant speed geodesic path two free particles may begin the same point the traveling with the same constant speed different after length the two particles collide the opposite side the both free particles traveled with constant satisfying the definition that forces were acceleration occurred and first law held this means that the particles were inertial frames since forces were was the geometry the situation which caused the two particles meet each other similar now common describe that exist dimensional geometry known spacetime this the curvature this space responsible for the way which two bodies with mass are drawn together even forces are this curvature spacetime replaces the force known gravity newtonian mechanics and special non inertial frames fictitious force inertial frame rotating frame reference here the relation between inertial and inertial observational frames reference the basic difference between these frames the need inertial frames for fictitious described accelerated frame reference often delineated being the primed frame and all variables that are dependent that frame are notated with the vector from the origin inertial reference frame the origin accelerated reference frame commonly notated given point interest that exists both the vector from the inertial origin the point called and the vector from the accelerated origin the point called from the geometry the get taking the first and second derivatives this with respect obtain where and are the velocity and acceleration the accelerated system with respect the inertial system and and are the velocity and acceleration the point interest with respect the inertial these equations allow transformations between the two coordinate for can now write newton second law when there accelerated motion due force being exerted there manifestation electric car designed recharge its battery system when decelerating switched the batteries are illustrating the physical strength manifestation however the manifestation inertia does not prevent acceleration for manifestation inertia occurs response change velocity due seen from the perspective rotating frame reference the manifestation inertia appears exert force either centrifugal direction direction orthogonal the coriolis effect common sort accelerated reference frame frame that both
