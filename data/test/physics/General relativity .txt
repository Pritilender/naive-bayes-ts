relativity classical theories gravitation albert einstein soon after publishing the special theory relativity einstein started thinking about how incorporate gravity into his new relativistic beginning with simple thought experiment involving observer free embarked what would year search for relativistic theory after numerous detours and false his work culminated the presentation the prussian academy science november what are now known the einstein field equations these equations specify how the geometry space and time influenced whatever matter and radiation are and form the core general theory the einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult einstein used approximation methods working out initial predictions the but early the astrophysicist karl schwarzschild found the first trivial exact solution the einstein field the called schwarzschild metric this solution laid the groundwork for the description the final stages gravitational and the objects known today black the same the first steps towards generalizing solution electrically charged objects were which eventually resulted the reissner solution now associated with electrically charged black einstein applied his theory the universe initiating the field relativistic cosmology line with contemporary assumed static adding new parameter his original field the cosmological constant reproduce that observation however the work hubble and others had shown that our universe expanding this readily described the expanding cosmological solutions found friedmann which not require cosmological lema tre used these solutions formulate the earliest version the big bang models which our universe has evolved from extremely hot and dense earlier einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder his during that general relativity remained something curiosity among physical was clearly superior newtonian gravity being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained the newtonian einstein himself had shown how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance the planet mercury without any arbitrary parameters fudge factors similarly expedition led eddington confirmed general prediction for the deflection starlight the sun during the total solar eclipse may making einstein instantly yet the theory entered the mainstream theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately and now known the golden age general relativity physicists began understand the concept black and identify quasars one these astrophysical ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the predictive and relativistic too became amenable direct observational from classical mechanics general relativity general relativity can understood examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics the first step the realization that classical mechanics and law gravity admit geometric the combination this description with the laws special relativity results heuristic derivation general geometry newtonian gravity the base classical mechanics the notion that body motion can described combination free inertial motion and deviations from this free such deviations are caused external forces acting body accordance with second law motion which states that the net force acting body equal that mass multiplied its acceleration the preferred inertial motions are related the geometry space and the standard reference frames classical objects free motion move along straight lines constant modern their paths are geodesics straight world lines curved conversely one might expect that inertial once identified observing the actual motions bodies and making allowances for the external forces such electromagnetism friction can used define the geometry well time coordinate however there ambiguity once gravity comes into according newton law gravity and independently verified experiments such

defined the absence for practical suitable model whenever gravity can bringing gravity into and assuming the universality free analogous reasoning the previous section there are global inertial frames instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling translated into the language the straight time like lines that define free inertial frame are deformed lines that are curved relative each suggesting that the inclusion gravity necessitates change spacetime not clear whether the new local frames free fall coincide with the reference frames which the laws special relativity that theory based the propagation and thus electromagnetism which could have different set preferred but using different assumptions about the relativistic frames such their being free one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift that the way which the frequency light shifts the light propagates through gravitational field below the actual measurements show that falling frames are the ones which light propagates does special the generalization this namely that the laws special relativity hold good approximation freely falling and reference known the einstein equivalence principle crucial guiding principle for generalizing relativistic physics include the same experimental data shows that time measured clocks gravitational proper time give the technical does not follow the rules special the language spacetime not measured the minkowski metric the newtonian this suggestive more general small all reference frames that are free fall are and approximately consequently are now dealing with curved generalization minkowski the metric tensor that defines the how lengths and angles are not the minkowski metric special generalization known

gravity corresponds changes the properties space and which turn changes the possible paths that objects will naturally the curvature caused the momentum paraphrasing the relativist john archibald wheeler spacetime tells matter how matter tells spacetime how while general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential classical physics symmetric rank two tensor the latter reduces the former certain limiting cases for weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative the speed the predictions converge those newton law universal gravitation constructed using tensors general relativity exhibits general covariance its and further laws formulated within the general relativistic take the same form all coordinate systems furthermore the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background background independent thus satisfies more stringent general principle relativity namely that the laws physics are the same for all locally expressed the equivalence principle

might einstein equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and difficult solve nevertheless number exact solutions are although only few have direct physical the known exact and also those most interesting from physics point are the schwarzschild solution the reissner solution and the kerr metric each corresponding certain type black hole otherwise empty and the friedmann walker and sitter universes each describing expanding exact solutions great theoretical interest include the del universe which opens the intriguing possibility time travel curved the taub nut solution model

spacetime that contains distribution matter that moves slowly compared with the speed the expansion involves series the first terms represent newtonian whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections theory due general extension this expansion the parametrized newtonian formalism which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions general relativity and alternative theories consequences theory general relativity has number physical some follow directly from the whereas others have become clear only the course the ninety years research that followed initial gravitational time dilation and frequency shift gravitational time dilation assuming that the equivalence principle holds gravity influences the passage light sent down into gravity well blueshifted whereas light sent the opposite direction climbing out the gravity redshifted collectively these two effects are known the gravitational frequency more processes close massive body run more slowly when compared

first derived this result using approximate metric representing the newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body test particle for the fact that his theory gave straightforward explanation the anomalous perihelion shift the planet mercury discovered earlier urbain verrier was important evidence that had last identified the correct form the gravitational field equations the effect can also derived using either the exact schwarzschild metric describing spacetime around spherical the much more general post newtonian formalism due the influence gravity the geometry space and the
