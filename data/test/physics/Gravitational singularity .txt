used measure the gravitational field become infinite way that does not depend the coordinate these quantities are the scalar invariant curvatures which includes measure the density for the purposes proving the penrose hawking singularity theorems spacetime with singularity defined one that contains geodesics that cannot extended smooth manner the end such geodesic considered the this different useful for proving the two most important types spacetime singularities are curvature singularities and conical singularities singularities can also divided according whether they are covered event horizon not naked singularities according general relativity the initial state the universe the beginning the big bang was both general relativity and quantum mechanics break down describing the big but quantum mechanics does not permit particles inhabit space smaller than their another type singularity predicted general relativity inside black hole any star collapsing beyond certain point the schwarzschild radius would form black inside which singularity covered event would all the matter would flow into certain point circular the black hole this again according general relativity without quantum mechanics which forbids wavelike particles entering space smaller than their these hypothetical singularities are also known curvature contents interpretation types curvature conical naked entropy see also notes references further reading interpretation many theories physics have mathematical singularities one kind equations for these physical theories predict that the ball mass some quantity becomes infinite increases without this generally sign for missing piece the the ultraviolet catastrophe renormalization and instability hydrogen atom predicted the larmor formula supersymmetry singularity the moduli space happens usually when there are additional massless degrees freedom that certain similarly thought that singularities spacetime often mean that there are additional degrees freedom that exist only within the vicinity the the same fields related the whole spacetime also for the electromagnetic field known examples string theory the latter degrees freedom are related closed strings while the degrees freedom are stuck the singularity and related either open strings the twisted sector orbifold some such the theory loop quantum gravity suggest that singularities may not the idea that due quantum gravity effects there minimum distance beyond which the force gravity longer continues increase the distance between the masses becomes the einstein cartan kibble theory gravity naturally averts the gravitational singularity the big this theory extends general relativity matter with intrinsic angular momentum spin removing constraint the symmetry the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric the torsion tensor variable varying the the minimal coupling between torsion and dirac spinors generates spin interaction fermionic matter which becomes dominant extremely high densities and prevents the scale factor the universe from reaching the big bang replaced like big bounce which the matter has enormous but finite density and before which the universe was types curvature solutions the equations general relativity another theory gravity such supergravity often result encountering points where the metric blows however many these points are completely regular and the infinities are merely result using inappropriate coordinate system this order test whether there singularity certain one must check whether this point diffeomorphism invariant quantities scalars become such quantities are the same every coordinate these infinities will not change example the schwarzschild solution that describes uncharged black coordinate systems convenient for working regions far away from the black part the metric becomes infinite the event horizon however spacetime the event horizon regular the regularity becomes evident when changing another coordinate system such the kruskal coordinates where the metric perfectly smooth the other the center the black hole where the metric becomes infinite the solutions suggest singularity the existence the singularity can verified noting that the kretschmann scalar being the square the riemann tensor which diffeomorphism while rotating black hole the singularity occurs single point the model called point rotating black also known kerr black hole the singularity occurs ring circular known ring singularity such singularity may also theoretically become wormhole more spacetime considered singular geodesically incomplete meaning that there are falling particles whose motion cannot determined beyond finite being after the point reaching the for any observer inside the event horizon rotating black hole would fall into its center within finite period the classical version the big bang cosmological model the universe contains causal singularity the start time where all like geodesics have extensions into the extrapolating backward this hypothetical time results universe with all spatial dimensions size infinite infinite and infinite time conical conical singularity occurs when there point where the limit every diffeomorphism invariant quantity which case spacetime not smooth the point the limit thus spacetime looks like cone around this where the singularity located the tip the the metric can finite everywhere suitable coordinate system example such conical singularity cosmic string naked naked singularity until the early was widely believed that general relativity hides every singularity behind event making naked singularities this referred the cosmic censorship hypothesis however physicists stuart shapiro and saul teukolsky performed computer simulations rotating plane dust that indicated that general relativity might allow for naked singularities what these objects would actually look like such model nor known whether singularities would still arise the simplifying assumptions used make the simulation were entropy black hole hawking radiation entropy before stephen hawking came with the concept hawking the question black holes having entropy was however this concept demonstrates that black holes can radiate which conserves entropy and solves the incompatibility problems with the second law thermodynamics entropy however implies heat and therefore the loss energy also suggests that black holes not last but rather evaporate slowly small black holes tend hotter whereas larger ones tend all known black hole candidates are large that their temperature far below that the cosmic background they are all gaining they will not begin lose energy until cosmological redshift more than one million rather than the thousand since the background radiation see also penrose hawking singularity theorems dimensional magnetic monopole dimensional cosmic string dimensional domain wall fuzzball string
