name reference the fine structure which results from the interaction between the magnetic moments associated with electron spin and the orbital angular momentum hyperfine with energy shifts typically orders magnitude smaller than the fine results from the interactions the nucleus with internally generated electric and magnetic hyperfine structure occurs due the energy the nuclear magnetic dipole moment the magnetic field generated the and the energy the nuclear electric quadrupole moment the electric field gradient due the distribution charge within the molecular hyperfine structure generally

external links history the optical hyperfine structure was already observed albert abraham michelson however only explained terms quantum mechanics when wolfgang pauli proposed the existence small nuclear magnetic moment sch ler and theodor schmidt proposed the existence nuclear quadrupole moment order explain anomalies the hyperfine theory the theory hyperfine structure comes directly from electromagnetism consisting the interaction the nuclear multipole moments excluding the electric with internally generated the theory derived first for the atomic but can applied each nucleus following this there discussion the additional effects unique the molecular atomic hyperfine structure magnetic dipole dipole the dominant term the hyperfine hamiltonian typically the magnetic dipole atomic nuclei with zero nuclear spin have magnetic dipole given where the factor and the nuclear magneton there energy associated with magnetic dipole moment the presence magnetic for nuclear magnetic dipole placed magnetic the relevant term the hamiltonian given the absence externally applied the magnetic field experienced the nucleus that associated with the orbital and spin angular momentum the electron orbital angular momentum results from the motion the electron about some fixed external point that shall take the location the the magnetic field the nucleus due the motion single with charge position relative the given where gives the position the nucleus relative the written terms the bohr magneton this recognizing that the electron and that the orbital angular momentum units can for many electron atom this expression generally written terms the total orbital angular summing over the electrons and using the projection where for states with well defined projection the orbital angular can write giving the electron spin angular momentum fundamentally different property that intrinsic the particle and therefore does not depend the motion the nonetheless angular momentum and any angular momentum associated with charged particle results magnetic dipole which the source magnetic electron with spin angular has magnetic given where the electron spin factor and the negative sign because the electron negatively charged consider that negatively and positively charged particles with identical travelling equivalent would have the same angular but would result currents the opposite the magnetic field dipole given the complete magnetic dipole contribution the hyperfine hamiltonian thus given the first term gives the energy the nuclear dipole the field due the electronic orbital angular the second term gives the energy the finite interaction the nuclear dipole with the field due the electron spin magnetic the final often known the fermi contact term relates the direct interaction the nuclear dipole with the spin dipoles and only zero for states with finite electron spin density the position the nucleus those with unpaired electrons has been argued that one may get different expression when taking into account the detailed nuclear magnetic moment for states with this can expressed the form where hyperfine structure small compared with the fine structure sometimes called coupling analogy with coupling and are good quantum numbers and matrix elements can approximated diagonal and this case generally true for light can project onto where the total electronic angular and this commonly written with determined since where the total angular this gives energy this case the hyperfine interaction satisfies the land interval rule electric quadrupole quadrupole atomic nuclei with spin have electric quadrupole moment the general case this represented rank tensor with components given where and are the tensor indices running from and are the spatial variables and depending the values and respectively the kronecker delta and the charge being dimensional tensor the quadrupole moment has components from the definition the components clear that the quadrupole tensor symmetric matrix that also traceless giving only five components the irreducible representation expressed using the notation irreducible spherical tensors the energy associated with electric quadrupole moment electric field depends not the field but the electric field confusingly labelled another tensor given the outer product the del operator with the electric field with components given again clear this symmetric matrix because the source the electric field the nucleus charge distribution entirely outside the this can expressed component spherical with where the quadrupolar term the hamiltonian thus given typical atomic nucleus closely approximates cylindrical symmetry and therefore all diagonal elements are close for this reason the nuclear electric quadrupole moment often represented molecular hyperfine structure the molecular hyperfine hamiltonian includes those terms already derived for the atomic case with magnetic dipole term for each nucleus with and electric quadrupole term for each nucleus with the magnetic dipole terms were first derived for diatomic molecules frosch and foley and the resulting hyperfine parameters are often called the frosch and foley addition the effects described above there are number effects specific the molecular direct nuclear spin each nucleus with has zero magnetic moment that both the source magnetic field and has associated energy due the presence the combined field all the other nuclear magnetic summation over each magnetic moment dotted with the field due each other magnetic moment gives the direct nuclear spin term the hyperfine where and are indices representing the nucleus contributing the energy and the nucleus that the source the field substituting the expressions for the dipole moment terms the nuclear angular momentum and the magnetic field both given nuclear rotation the nuclear magnetic moments molecule exist magnetic field due the angular the internuclear

later voyager golden record radio astronomy heterodyne receivers are widely used detection the electromagnetic signals from celestial the separations among various components hyperfine structure are usually small enough fit into the band because optical depth varies with strength ratios among the hyperfine components differ from that their intrinsic from this can derive the physical nuclear
