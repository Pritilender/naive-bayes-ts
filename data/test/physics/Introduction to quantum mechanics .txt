rydberg dinger sommerfeld von neumann weyl wien wigner zeeman zeilinger quantum mechanics the science the very the body scientific principles that explains the behaviour matter and its interactions with energy the scale atoms and subatomic particles classical physics explains matter and energy scale familiar human including the behaviour astronomical remains the key measurement for much modern science and however toward the end the scientists discovered phenomena both the large macro and the small worlds that classical physics could not coming terms with these limitations led two major revolutions physics one being the theory relativity the other being the development quantum this article describes how physicists discovered the limitations classical physics and developed the main concepts the quantum theory that replaced the early decades the these concepts are described roughly the order which they were first for more complete history the see history quantum mechanics the word quantum this sense means the minimum amount any physical entity involved certain characteristics matter can take only discrete light behaves some respects like particles and other respects like matter particles such electrons and atoms exhibits wavelike behaviour too some light including neon lights give off only certain discrete frequencies quantum mechanics shows that light and all other forms electromagnetic radiation comes discrete called photons and predicts its colours and spectral intensities some aspects quantum mechanics can seem counterintuitive even paradoxical because they describe behaviour quite different from that seen larger length the words richard feynman quantum mechanics deals with nature she absurd for the uncertainty principle quantum mechanics means that the more closely one pins down one measurement such the position the less precise another measurement pertaining the same particle such its momentum must contents the first quantum max planck and body

quantum max planck and body radiation thermal radiation electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface object due the temperature object heated starts emit light the red end the spectrum red hot heating further causes the colour change from red yellow white light shorter wavelengths higher begins turns out that perfect emitter also perfect when such object looks perfectly because absorbs all the light that falls and emits consequently ideal thermal emitter known black body and the radiation emits called black body radiation the late thermal radiation had been fairly characterized note however classical physics was unable explain the relationship between temperatures and predominant frequencies physicists were searching for single theory that explained why they got the experimental results that they rayleigh jeans law wien approximation the first model that was able explain the full spectrum thermal radiation was put forward max planck came with mathematical model which the thermal radiation was equilibrium with set harmonic oscillators reproduce the experimental results had assume that each oscillator produced integer number units energy its single characteristic rather than being able emit any arbitrary amount other the energy each oscillator was note the quantum energy for each according was proportional the frequency the the constant proportionality now known the planck constant the planck usually written has the value and the energy oscillator frequency given planck law was the first quantum theory and planck won the nobel prize recognition the services rendered the advancement physics his discovery energy the however planck view was that quantization was purely mathematical rather than now fundamental change our understanding the photons the quantisation light albert einstein albert einstein took extra suggested that quantisation was not just mathematical the energy beam light occurs individual which are now called photons the energy single photon given its frequency multiplied for scientists had debated between two possible theories was wave did instead comprise stream tiny particles the the debate was generally considered have been settled favour the wave was able explain observed effects such refraction diffraction and polarization james clerk maxwell had shown that magnetism and light are all manifestations the same the electromagnetic field maxwell equations which are the complete set laws classical electromagnetism describe light combination oscillating electric and magnetic because the preponderance evidence favour the wave einstein ideas were met initially with great eventually however the photon model became one the most significant pieces evidence its favour was its ability explain several puzzling properties the photoelectric effect described the following nonetheless the wave analogy remained indispensable for helping understand other characteristics such diffraction the photoelectric effect photoelectric effect heinrich hertz observed that when with sufficient hits metallic surface emits electrons philipp lenard discovered that the maximum possible energy ejected electron related the frequency the not its intensity the frequency too electrons are ejected regardless the the lowest frequency light that can cause electrons called the threshold different for different this observation odds with classical which predicts that the energy should proportional the intensity the einstein explained the effect postulating that beam light stream particles photons and that the beam frequency then each photon has energy equal electron likely struck only single which imparts most energy the therefore the intensity the beam has note only its frequency determines the maximum energy that can imparted the explain the threshold einstein argued that takes certain amount called the work function denoted remove electron from the this amount energy different for each the energy the photon less than the work function then does not carry sufficient energy remove the electron from the the threshold the frequency photon whose energy equal the work greater than the energy enough remove the ejected electron has kinetic energy which equal the energy minus the energy needed dislodge the electron from the einstein description light being composed particles extended planck notion quantised single photon given frequency delivers invariant amount energy other individual photons can deliver more less but only depending their however although the photon particle was still being described having the like property once the particle account light was being compromised note consequences the light being quantised the relationship between the frequency electromagnetic radiation and the energy each individual photon why ultraviolet light can cause but visible infrared light photon ultraviolet light will deliver high amount energy enough contribute cellular damage such occurs photon infrared light will deliver lower amount only enough warm infrared lamp can warm large perhaps large enough keep people comfortable cold but cannot give anyone each individual photon had identical would not correct talk high photon light high frequency could deliver more energy only because flooding surface with more photons arriving per second light low frequency could deliver less energy only delivered fewer photons per second were true that all photons carry the same then you doubled the rate photon you would double the number energy units arriving each second regardless the frequency the incident einstein rejected that dependent classical approach favour based analysis where the energy the particle must absolute and varies with frequency discrete steps all photons the same frequency have identical and all photons different frequencies have proportionally different single photons are rarely the sun emits photons continuously all electromagnetic they appear propagate continuous not discrete the emission sources available hertz and lennard the century shared that star that radiates red piece iron forge that glows may both said contain great deal might surmised that adding continuously the total energy some radiating body would make radiate red orange yellow green blue violet and that but that not larger stars and larger pieces iron forge would then necessarily glow with colours more toward the violet end the change the colour such radiating body necessary change its increase temperature changes the quanta energy available excite individual atoms higher enabling them emit photons higher the total energy emitted per unit time star piece iron depends both the number photons emitted per unit well the amount energy carried each the photons other the characteristic frequency radiating body dependent its when physicists were looking only beams light containing huge numbers individual and virtually indistinguishable was difficult understand the importance the energy levels individual when physicists first discovered devices exhibiting the photoelectric they initially expected that higher intensity light would produce higher voltage from the photoelectric conversely they discovered that strong beams light toward the red end the spectrum might produce electrical potential and that weak beams light toward the violet end the spectrum would produce higher and higher einstein idea that individual units light may contain different amounts depending their made possible explain such experimental results that had hitherto seemed quite although the energy imparted photons invariant any given the initial energy state the electrons photoelectric device prior absorption light not necessarily anomalous results may occur the case individual for electron that was already excited above the equilibrium level the photoelectric device might ejected when absorbed uncharacteristically low frequency statistically however the characteristic behaviour photoelectric device will reflect the behaviour the vast majority its which will their equilibrium this point helpful comprehending the distinction between the study individual particles quantum dynamics and the study massed particles classical the quantisation the bohr model the atom the dawn the evidence required model the atom with diffuse cloud charged electrons surrounding dense positively charged nucleus these properties suggested model which the electrons circle around the nucleus like planets orbiting note however was also known that the atom this model would according classical theory orbiting electrons are undergoing centripetal and should therefore give off electromagnetic the loss energy also causing them spiral toward the colliding with fraction related puzzle was the emission spectrum when gas gives off light only discrete for the visible light given off hydrogen consists four different shown the picture the intensity the light different frequencies also white light consists continuous emission across the whole range visible the end the nineteenth simple rule had been found which showed how the frequencies the different lines were related each though without explaining why this making any prediction about the the formula also predicted some additional spectral lines ultraviolet and infrared light which had not been observed the these lines were later observed raising confidence the value the emission spectrum hydrogen the swiss mathematician johann balmer discovered that each wavelength the visible spectrum hydrogen related some integer the equation where constant which balmer determined equal johannes rydberg generalized and greatly increased the explanatory utility predicted that related two integers and according what now known the rydberg formula where the rydberg constant equal and must greater than rydberg formula accounts for the four visible wavelengths hydrogen setting and also predicts additional wavelengths the emission for and for the emission spectrum should contain certain ultraviolet and for and should also contain certain infrared experimental observation these wavelengths came two decades louis paschen found some the predicted infrared and theodore lyman found some the predicted ultraviolet note that both balmer and formulas involve modern they imply that some property the atom understanding exactly what this property and why was was major part the development quantum will shown the rest this bohr model niels bohr proposed new model the atom that included quantized electron electrons still orbit the nucleus much planets orbit around the but they are only permitted inhabit certain not orbit any when atom emitted energy the electron did not move continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus might expected instead the electron would jump instantaneously from one orbit giving off the emitted light the form the possible energies photons given off each element were determined the differences energy between the and the emission spectrum for each element would contain number starting from only one simple assumption about the rule that the orbits must the bohr model was able relate the observed spectral lines the emission spectrum hydrogen known model the electron simply allowed continuously emit energy and crash into the once was the closest permitted was stable bohr model explain why the orbits should quantised that and was also unable make accurate predictions for atoms with more than one explain why some spectral lines are brighter than although some the fundamental assumptions the bohr model were soon found the key result that the discrete lines emission spectra are due some property the electrons atoms being quantised the way that the electrons actually behave strikingly different from and from what see the world our everyday this modern quantum mechanical model the atom discussed below bohr theorised that the angular momentum electron where integer and the planck starting from this coulomb law and the equations circular motion show that electron with units angular momentum will orbit proton distance given where the coulomb constant the mass and the charge electron for simplicity this written where called the bohr radius equal the bohr radius the radius the smallest allowed the energy the electron note can also and given thus assumption that angular momentum quantised means that electron can only inhabit certain orbits around the and that can have only certain consequence these constraints that the electron will not crash into the cannot continuously emit and cannot come closer the nucleus than the bohr electron loses energy jumping instantaneously from its original orbit lower the extra energy emitted the form conversely electron that absorbs photon gains hence jumps orbit that farther from the each photon from glowing atomic hydrogen due electron moving from higher with radius lower the energy this photon the difference the energies and the since equation shows that the energy related its wavelength the wavelengths light that can emitted are given this equation has the same form the rydberg and predicts that the constant should given therefore the bohr model the atom can predict the emission spectrum hydrogen terms fundamental note however was not able make accurate predictions for electron explain why some spectral lines are brighter than wave particle duality wave particle duality play media louis broglie nobel prize physics just light has both like and like matter also has like properties matter behaving wave was first demonstrated experimentally for beam electrons can exhibit diffraction just like beam light water note similar like phenomena were later shown for atoms and even small the associated with any object related its through the planck constant the called the broglie holds for all types all matter exhibits properties both particles and the concept particle duality says that neither the classical concept particle nor wave can fully describe the behaviour scale either photons wave particle duality example the principle complementarity quantum elegant example particle the double slit discussed the section the slit experiment double slit experiment the slit experiment originally performed thomas young and augustin fresnel beam light directed through two closely spaced producing interference pattern light and dark bands one the slits covered one might naively expect that the intensity the fringes due interference would halved much simpler pattern simple diffraction pattern closing one slit results much simpler pattern diametrically opposite the open exactly the same behaviour can demonstrated water and the slit experiment was seen demonstration the wave nature interferes the slit experiment has also been performed using atoms and even and the same type interference pattern thus has been demonstrated that all matter possesses both particle and wave even the source intensity turned down that only one particle photon passing through the apparatus the same interference pattern develops over the quantum particle acts wave when passing through the double but particle when this typical feature quantum quantum particle will act wave when experiment measure its like and like particle when experiment measure its like where the detector screen any individual particle shows will the result entirely random however the distribution pattern many individual particles will mimic the diffraction pattern produced application the bohr model broglie expanded the bohr model the atom showing that electron orbit around nucleus could thought having like electron will observed only situations that permit standing wave around nucleus example standing wave violin which fixed both ends and can made the waves created stringed instrument appear oscillate moving from crest trough down the wavelength standing wave related the length the vibrating object and the boundary for because the violin string fixed both can carry standing waves wavelengths where the length and positive broglie suggested that the allowed electron orbits were those for which the circumference the orbit would integer number the wavelength therefore determines that only bohr orbits certain distances from the nucleus are any distance from the nucleus smaller than certain value would impossible establish the minimum possible distance from the nucleus called the bohr treatment quantum events served starting point for dinger when set out construct wave equation describe quantum theoretical development modern quantum mechanics when bohr assigned his younger colleagues the task finding explanation for the intensities the different lines the hydrogen emission werner heisenberg moved forward from recent success explaining simpler means series mathematical wrote out the quantum mechanical analogue for the classical computation shortly heisenberg colleague max born realised that method calculating the probabilities for transitions between the different energy levels could best expressed using the mathematical concept matrices note erwin dinger erwin dinger based himself hypothesis that learned and during the first half successfully described the behaviour quantum mechanical the mathematical called the schr dinger equation after its central quantum defines the permitted stationary states quantum and describes how the quantum state physical system changes the wave itself described mathematical function known wave function and usually represented the greek letter psi the paper that introduced schr cat says that the wave function provides the means for predicting probability measurement and that therefore provides future somewhat laid down catalog for more information see schr dinger equation schr dinger was able calculate the energy levels hydrogen treating hydrogen electron classical moving well electrical potential created the this calculation accurately reproduced the energy levels the bohr may schr dinger proved that matrix mechanics and his own wave mechanics made the same predictions about the properties and behaviour the mathematically the two theories were yet the two men disagreed the interpretation their mutual for heisenberg saw problem the theoretical prediction instantaneous transitions electrons between orbits but dinger hoped that theory based continuous like properties could avoid what called paraphrased wilhelm wien this nonsense about quantum copenhagen interpretation copenhagen interpretation niels bohr institute heisenberg and others tried explain what these experimental results and mathematical models really their known the copenhagen interpretation quantum aimed describe the nature reality that was being probed the measurements and described the mathematical formulations quantum the main principles the copenhagen interpretation system completely described wave function how changes over time given the dinger the description nature essentially the probability for where the screen particle will show the two slit related the square the absolute value the amplitude its wave born rule due max born which gives physical meaning the wave function the copenhagen the probability amplitude not possible know the values all the properties the system the same those properties that are not known with precision must described uncertainty principle matter like exhibits particle experiment can demonstrate the like properties its like but not both the same complementarity principle due measuring devices are essentially classical and measure classical properties such position and the quantum mechanical description large systems should closely approximate the classical correspondence principle bohr and various consequences these principles are discussed more detail the following uncertainty principle uncertainty principle werner heisenberg nobel prize physics suppose that want measure the position and speed for example car going through radar speed assume that the car has definite position and speed particular moment and how accurately can measure these values depends the quality our measuring improve the precision our measuring will get result that closer the true would assume that how precisely measure the speed the car does not affect its and vice heisenberg proved that these assumptions are not quantum mechanics shows that certain pairs physical like position and cannot both known arbitrary the more precisely one property the less precisely the other can this statement known the uncertainty principle the uncertainty principle statement about the accuracy our measuring but about the nature the system our assumption that the car had definite position and speed was scale cars and these uncertainties are too small but when dealing with atoms and electrons they become heisenberg the measurement the position and momentum electron using photon measuring the the higher the frequency the photon the more accurate the measurement the position the but the greater the disturbance the which absorbs random amount rendering the measurement obtained its momentum increasingly uncertain momentum velocity multiplied for one necessarily measuring its impact disturbed from the collision not its original with photon lower frequency the hence the momentum but the accuracy the measurement the position the the uncertainty principle shows mathematically that the product the uncertainty the position and momentum particle momentum velocity multiplied could never less than certain and that this value related planck constant wave function collapse wave function collapse wave function collapse forced expression for whatever just happened when becomes appropriate replace the description uncertain state system description the system definite explanations for the nature the process becoming certain are any time before photon shows detection screen can only described set probabilities for where might show when does show for instance the ccd electronic the time and the space where interacted with the device are known within very tight however the photon has and the wave function has disappeared with its place some physical change the detection screen has exposed spot sheet photographic change electric potential some cell eigenstates and eigenvalues for more detailed introduction this see introduction eigenstates because the uncertainty principle statements about both the position and momentum particles can only assign probability that the position momentum will have some numerical therefore necessary formulate clearly the difference between the state something that such electron probability and the state something having definite when object can definitely some said possess eigenstate the pauli exclusion principle pauli exclusion principle wolfgang pauli wolfgang pauli proposed new quantum degree freedom quantum number with two possible resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the predictions quantum the spectrum atomic hydrogen had doublet pair lines differing small where only one line was pauli formulated his exclusion principle stating that there cannot exist atom such quantum state that two electrons within have the same set quantum year uhlenbeck and goudsmit identified new degree freedom with property called spin the originating with ralph kronig was that electrons behave they spin about spin would account for the missing magnetic moment and allow two electrons the same orbital occupy distinct quantum states they spun opposite thus satisfying the exclusion the quantum number represented the sense positive application the hydrogen atom atomic orbital model model the atom was essentially planetary with the electrons orbiting around the nuclear however the uncertainty principle states that electron cannot simultaneously have exact location and velocity the way that planet instead classical electrons are said inhabit atomic orbitals orbital the cloud possible locations which electron might distribution probabilities rather than precise each orbital three rather than the two dimensional and often depicted dimensional region within which there percent probability finding the schr dinger was able calculate the energy levels hydrogen treating hydrogen electron represented the wave function electric potential well created the the solutions equation are distributions probabilities for electron positions and orbitals have range different shapes three the energies the different orbitals can and they accurately match the energy levels the bohr within each electron has four orbital designation indicating whether the particle wave one that closer the nucleus with less energy one that farther from the nucleus with more the shape the spherical the inclination the determining the magnetic moment the orbital around the the spin the the collective name for these properties the quantum state the the quantum state can described giving number each these these are known the quantum numbers the quantum state the electron described its wave the pauli exclusion principle demands that two electrons within atom may have the same values all four the first property describing the orbital the principal quantum number which the same denotes the energy level each the possible values for are the next quantum the azimuthal quantum number denoted describes the shape the the shape consequence the angular momentum the the angular momentum represents the resistance spinning object speeding slowing down under the influence external the azimuthal quantum number represents the orbital angular momentum electron around its the possible values for are integers from the shape each orbital has its own letter the first shape denoted the letter mnemonic being the next shape denoted the letter and has the form the other orbitals have more complicated shapes see atomic orbital and are denoted the letters and the third quantum the magnetic quantum number describes the magnetic moment the and denoted simply the possible values for are integers from the magnetic quantum number measures the component the angular momentum particular the choice direction conventionally the direction the fourth quantum the spin quantum number pertaining the orientation the denoted with values the chemist linus pauling wrote way the case helium atom with two electrons the orbital the pauli exclusion principle requires that the two electrons differ the value one quantum their values and are the moreover they have the same accordingly they must differ the value which can have the value for one electron and for the the underlying structure and symmetry atomic and the way that electrons fill that leads the organisation the periodic table the way the atomic orbitals different atoms combine form molecular orbitals determines the structure and strength chemical bonds between dirac wave equation dirac equation paul dirac paul dirac extended the pauli equation which described spinning account for special relativity the result was theory that dealt properly with such the speed which electron orbits the occurring substantial fraction the speed light using the simplest electromagnetic interaction dirac was able predict the value the magnetic moment associated with the and found the experimentally observed which was too large that spinning charged sphere governed classical physics was able solve for the spectral lines the hydrogen atom and reproduce from physical first principles sommerfeld successful formula for the fine structure the hydrogen dirac equations sometimes yielded negative value for for which proposed novel posited the existence antielectron and dynamical this led the particle quantum field theory quantum entanglement quantum entanglement the pauli exclusion principle says that two electrons one system cannot the same nature leaves open the however that two electrons can have both states superimposed over each recall that the wave functions that emerge simultaneously from the double slits arrive the detection screen state nothing certain until the superimposed waveforms collapse that instant electron shows somewhere accordance with the probability that the square the absolute value the sum the valued amplitudes the two superimposed the situation there already very concrete way thinking about entangled photons which two contrary states are superimposed each them the same imagine that the superposition state that can mentally labeled blue and another state that can mentally labeled red will then appear purple two photons are produced the result the same atomic perhaps they are produced the excitation crystal that characteristically absorbs photon certain frequency and emits two photons half the original the two photons come out the experimenter now performs some experiment that will determine whether one the photons either blue then that experiment changes the photon involved from one having superposition blue and red characteristics photon that has only one those the problem that einstein had with such imagined situation was that one these photons had been kept bouncing between mirrors laboratory and the other one had traveled halfway the nearest when its twin was made reveal itself either blue that meant that the distant photon now had lose its purple status whenever might investigated after its twin had been would necessarily show the opposite state whatever its twin had trying show that quantum mechanics was not complete einstein started with the prediction that two more particles that have interacted the past can appear strongly correlated when their various properties are later sought explain this seeming interaction classical through their common and preferably not some spooky action the argument worked out famous einstein podolsky and rosen abbreviated setting out what now called the epr paradox assuming what now usually called local realism epr attempted show from quantum theory that particle has both position and momentum while according the copenhagen interpretation only one those two properties actually exists and only the moment that being epr concluded that quantum theory incomplete that refuses consider physical properties which objectively exist podolsky rosen currently most cited publication physics the same erwin dinger used the word entanglement and would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait quantum the question whether entanglement real condition still the bell inequalities are the most powerful challenge quantum field theory quantum field theory the idea quantum field theory began the late with british physicist paul dirac when attempted quantise the electromagnetic field procedure for constructing quantum theory starting from classical field physics region space which given effect such magnetism exists other effects that manifest themselves fields are gravitation and static electricity physicist richard hammond wrote that sometimes distinguish between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory refers system which the number particles and the fields such the electromechanical are continuous classical qft goes step further and allows for the creation and annihilation particles however that quantum mechanics often used refer the entire notion quantum dirac proposed the existence particles that later became known anti matter dirac shared the nobel prize physics for with schr dinger for the discovery new productive forms atomic theory quantum electrodynamics quantum electrodynamics quantum electrodynamics the name the quantum theory the electromagnetic force understanding qed begins with understanding electromagnetism electromagnetism can called electrodynamics because dynamic interaction between electrical and magnetic forces electromagnetism begins with the electric charge electric charges are the sources and electric fields electric field field which exerts force any particles that carry electric any point this includes the proton and even quarks among force electric charges current flows and magnetic field the magnetic turn causes electric current moving the interacting electric and magnetic field called electromagnetic field the physical description interacting charged particles electrical electrical and magnetic fields called paul dirac produced relativistic quantum theory this was the progenitor modern quantum that had essential ingredients the modern however the problem unsolvable infinities developed this relativistic quantum theory years renormalization solved this initially viewed provisional procedure some its renormalization eventually was embraced important and consistent tool qed and other fields also the late feynman diagrams depicted all possible interactions pertaining given the diagrams showed that the electromagnetic force the interactions photons between interacting example prediction quantum electrodynamics which has been verified experimentally the lamb shift this refers effect whereby the quantum nature the electromagnetic field causes the energy levels atom ion deviate slightly from what they would otherwise spectral lines may shift the physicists realized that qed broke down extremely high from this inconsistency the standard model particle physics was which remedied the higher energy breakdown the standard model unifies the electromagnetic and weak interactions into one this called the electroweak theory interpretations interpretations quantum mechanics the physical equations and predictions pertinent quantum mechanics are all consistent and hold very high level however the question what these abstract models say about the underlying nature the real world has received competing applications quantum applications applications quantum mechanics include the laser the transistor the electron microscope and magnetic resonance imaging special class quantum mechanical applications related macroscopic quantum phenomena such superfluid helium and the study
