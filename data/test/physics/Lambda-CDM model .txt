readings external links overview most modern cosmological models are based the cosmological principle which states that our observational location the universe not unusual enough the universe looks the same all directions and from every location the model includes expansion metric space that well documented both the red shift prominent spectral absorption emission lines the light from distant galaxies and the time dilation the light decay supernova luminosity both effects are attributed doppler shift electromagnetic radiation travels across expanding while this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational does not increase the size the objects galaxies also allows for distant galaxies recede from each other speeds greater than the speed local expansion less than the speed but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed the letter stands for the cosmological constant which currently associated with vacuum

remaining comprises all ordinary matter observed chemical gas and the stuff which visible stars and galaxies are also the energy density includes very small fraction cosmic microwave background and

abrupt appearance expanding space time containing radiation temperatures around this was immediately within seconds followed exponential expansion space scale multiplier known cosmic inflation the early universe remained hot above for several hundred thousand state that detectable residual cosmic microwave background very low energy radiation emanating from all parts the the big scenario with cosmic inflation and standard particle the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion the observed distribution lighter elements the universe helium and and the spatial texture minute irregularities anisotropies the cmb cosmic inflation also addresses the horizon problem the indeed seems likely that the universe larger than the observable particle horizon the model uses the flrw metric the friedmann equations and the cosmological equations state describe the observable universe from right after the inflationary epoch present and history the discovery the cosmic microwave background confirmed key prediction the big bang cosmology from that point was generally accepted that the universe started dense state and has been expanding over the rate expansion depends the types matter and energy present the and whether the total density above below the called critical during the most attention focused baryonic but there were serious challenges explaining the formation given the small anisotropies the cmb upper limits that the early was realized that this could resolved cold dark matter dominated over the and the theory cosmic inflation motivated models with critical during the most research focused cold dark matter with critical density around cdm and baryons these showed success forming galaxies and clusters but problems notably the model required hubble constant lower than preferred and the model predicted observed scale galaxy these difficulties sharpened with the discovery cmb anisotropy cobe and several alternatives including cdm and mixed hot dark matter came under active the cdm model then became the standard following the observations accelerating expansion and was quickly supported other the boomerang microwave background experiment measured the total density close while the dfgrs galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density near the large difference between these supports positive dark energy much more precise measurements the microwave background from wmap have continued support and refine the there currently active research into many aspects the cdm both refine the parameters and possibly detect cdm has explicit physical theory for the origin physical nature dark matter dark the nearly invariant spectrum the cmb and their image across the celestial are believed result from very small thermal and
