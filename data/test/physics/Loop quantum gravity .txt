equation quantum called the wheeler dewitt equation admitted solutions labelled when rewritten the new ashtekar variables and carlo rovelli and lee smolin defined nonperturbative and independent quantum theory gravity terms these loop jorge pullin and jurek lewandowski understood that the intersections the loops are essential for the consistency the and the theory should formulated terms intersecting graphs rovelli and smolin showed that the quantum operators the theory associated area and volume have discrete that geometry quantized this result defines explicit basis states quantum which turned out labelled roger penrose spin networks which are graphs labelled spins the canonical version the dynamics was put firm ground thomas thiemann who defined free hamiltonian showing the existence mathematically consistent independent the covariant spinfoam version the dynamics developed during several and crystallized from the joint work research groups canada poland and leading the definition family transition which the classical limit can shown related family truncations general the finiteness these amplitudes was proven requires the existence positive cosmological constant and this consistent with observed acceleration the expansion the universe general covariance and background independence general covariance independent diffeomorphism theoretical general covariance the invariance the form physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate the essential idea that coordinates are only artifices used describing and hence should play role the formulation fundamental physical more significant requirement the principle general relativity that states that the laws physics take the same form all reference this generalization the principle special relativity which states that the laws physics take the same form all inertial diffeomorphism isomorphism the category smooth invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold such that both the function and its inverse are these are the defining symmetry transformations general relativity since the theory formulated only terms differentiable general general covariance intimately related diffeomorphism this symmetry one the defining features the however common misunderstanding that diffeomorphism refers the invariance the physical predictions theory under arbitrary coordinate transformations this untrue and fact every physical theory invariant under coordinate transformations this diffeomorphisms mathematicians define correspond something much more intuitively way they can envisaged simultaneously dragging all the physical fields including the gravitational over the bare differentiable manifold while staying the same coordinate diffeomorphisms are the true symmetry transformations general and come about from the assertion that the formulation the theory based bare differentiable but not any prior geometry the theory background independent this profound all physical theories before general relativity had part their formulation prior what preserved under such transformations are the coincidences between the values the gravitational field take such and such and the values the matter fields take from these relationships one can form notion matter being located with respect the gravitational vice this what einstein physical entities are located with respect one another only and not with respect the spacetime manifold carlo rovelli puts more fields just fields this the true meaning the saying the stage disappears and becomes one the space time over which physics takes place has objective physical meaning and instead the gravitational interaction represented just one the fields forming the this known the relationalist interpretation the realization einstein that general relativity should interpreted this way the origin his remark beyond wildest lqg this aspect general relativity taken seriously and this symmetry preserved requiring that the physical states remain invariant under the generators the interpretation this condition well understood for purely spatial however the understanding diffeomorphisms involving time the hamiltonian constraint more subtle because related dynamics and the called problem time general generally accepted calculational framework account for this constraint has yet plausible candidate for the quantum hamiltonian constraint the operator introduced lqg formally background independent the equations lqg are not embedded space and time except for its invariant instead they are expected give rise space and time distances which are large compared the planck length the issue background independence lqg still has some unresolved for some derivations require fixed choice the topology while any consistent quantum theory gravity should include topology change dynamical constraints and their poisson bracket algebra poisson bracket hamiltonian constraint the constraints classical canonical general relativity lie derivative the hamiltonian formulation ordinary classical mechanics the poisson bracket important canonical coordinate consists canonical position and momentum variables that satisfy canonical bracket where the poisson bracket given for arbitrary phase space functions and with the use poisson the hamilton equations can rewritten these equations describe orbit phase space generated the hamiltonian given any phase space function have let consider constrained which general relativity similar way the poisson bracket between constraint and the phase space variables generates flow along orbit the phase space generated the there are three types constraints reformulation classical general gauss gauge constraints the gauss constraints this represents infinite number constraints one for each value these come about from expressing general relativity yang mills type gauge theory mills generalization theory where the gauge field transforms vector under gauss that the gauge field the form where internal see ashtekar variables these infinite number gauss gauge constraints can smeared with test fields with internal which demand vanish for any such these smeared constraints defined with respect suitable space smearing functions give equivalent description the original fact formulation may thought ordinary yang mills theory together with the following special resulting from diffeomorphism and hamiltonian that the dynamics such theory are thus very different from that ordinary mills spatial diffeomorphisms constraints the spatial diffeomorphism constraints can smeared the called shift functions give equivalent set smeared spatial diffeomorphism these generate spatial diffeomorphisms along orbits defined the shift function hamiltonian constraints the hamiltonian can smeared the called lapse functions give equivalent set smeared hamiltonian these generate time diffeomorphisms along orbits defined the lapse function ashtekar formulation the gauge field the configuration variable the configuration variable being analogous ordinary and its conjugate momentum the triad electrical the constraints are certain functions these phase space consider the action the constraints arbitrary phase space important notion here the lie derivative which basically derivative operation that infinitesimally shifts functions along some orbit with tangent vector the poisson bracket algebra particular importance the poisson bracket algebra formed between the constraints themselves completely determines the terms the above the smeared constraints the constraint algebra amongst the law where and see that the poisson bracket two law equivalent single law evaluated the commutator the the poisson bracket amongst spatial diffeomorphisms constraints reads and see that its effect shift the the reason for this that the smearing functions are not functions the canonical variables and the spatial diffeomorphism does not generate diffeomorphims they however generate diffeomorphims everything this equivalent leaving everything else fixed while shifting the smearing the action the spatial diffeomorphism the gauss law again shifts the test field the gauss law has vanishing poisson bracket with the hamiltonian the spatial diffeomorphism constraint with hamiltonian gives hamiltonian with its smearing finally the poisson bracket two hamiltonians spatial where some phase space that sum over infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms constraints where the coefficients proportionality are not constants but have trivial phase space poisson lie algebra with constraints the form where are constants the called structure constants the above poisson bracket algebra for general relativity does not form true lie algebra have structure functions rather than structure constants for the poisson bracket between two this leads dirac observables the constraints define constraint surface the original phase the gauge motions the constraints apply all phase space but have the feature that they leave the constraint surface where and thus the orbit point the hypersurface under gauge transformations will orbit entirely within dirac observables are defined phase space that poisson commute with all the constraints when the constraint equations are that they are quantities defined the constraint surface that are invariant under the gauge transformations the then solving only the constraint and determining the dirac observables with respect leads back the adm phase space with constraints the dynamics general relativity generated the can shown that six einstein equations describing time evolution really gauge can obtained calculating the poisson brackets the metric and its conjugate momentum with linear combination the spatial diffeomorphism and hamiltonian the vanishing the giving the physical phase are the four other einstein quantization the constraints the equations quantum general relativity this section may too technical for most readers understand please help improve this section make understandable experts without removing the technical the talk page may contain december pre history and ashtekar new variables frame fields general relativity ashtekar variables dual palatini action many the technical problems canonical quantum gravity revolve around the canonical general relativity was originally formulated terms metric but there seemed insurmountable mathematical difficulties promoting the constraints quantum operators because their highly linear dependence the canonical the equations were much simplified with the introduction ashtekars new ashtekar variables describe canonical general relativity terms new pair canonical variables closer that gauge the first step consists using densitized triads triad simply three orthogonal vector fields labeled and the densitized triad defined encode information about the spatial where the flat space and the above equation expresses that when written terms the basis locally formulating general relativity with triads instead metrics was not the densitized triads are not and fact one can perform local space rotation with respect the internal indices the canonically conjugate variable related the extrinsic curvature but problems similar using the metric formulation arise when one tries quantize the ashtekar new insight was introduce new configuration that behaves complex connection where related the called spin connection via here called the chiral spin defines covariant derivative turns out that the conjugate momentum and together these form new the expressions for the constraints ashtekar the the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and the hamiltonian constraint then respectively where the field strength tensor the connection and where referred the vector the above mentioned local space rotational invariance the original the gauge invariance here expressed the gauss note that these constraints are polynomial the fundamental unlike with the constraints the metric this dramatic simplification seemed open the way quantizing the with new given the configuration variable natural consider wavefunctions this the connection analogous ordinary quantum mechanics with configuration variable and wavefunctions the configuration variable gets promoted quantum operator analogous and the triads are derivatives analogous passing over the quantum theory the constraints become operators kinematic hilbert space the unconstrained yang mills hilbert note that different ordering the and when replacing the with derivatives give rise different operators the choice made called the factor ordering and should chosen via physical formally they read there are still problems properly defining all these equations and solving for example the hamiltonian constraint ashtekar worked with was the densitized version instead the original that worked with there were serious difficulties promoting this quantity quantum moreover although ashtekar variables had the virtue simplifying the they are when one quantizes the difficult ensure that one recovers real general relativity opposed complex general quantum constraints the equations quantum general relativity now move demonstrate important aspect the quantum consider law first state the classical result that the poisson bracket the smeared law with the connections the quantum law reads one smears the quantum law and study its action the quantum state one finds that the action the constraint the quantum state equivalent shifting the argument infinitesimal the sense the parameter small gauge and the last identity comes from the fact that the constraint annihilates the the quantum imposing the same symmetry that its vanishing imposed telling that the functions have gauge invariant functions the the same idea true for the other therefore the two step process the classical theory solving the constraints equivalent solving the admissibility conditions for the initial and looking for the gauge orbits solving the equations replaced one step process the quantum namely looking for solutions the quantum equations this because obviously solves the constraint the quantum level and simultaneously looks for states that are gauge invariant because the quantum generator gauge transformations gauge invariant functions are constant along the gauge orbits and thus characterize recall the classical solving the admissibility conditions and evolution equations was equivalent solving all field this underlines the central role the quantum constraint equations canonical quantum introduction the loop representation holonomy wilson loop knot invariant was particular the inability have good control over the space solutions the law and spacial diffeomorphism constraints that led rovelli and smolin consider new representation the the loop representation gauge theories and quantum gravity need the notion holonomy holonomy measure how much the initial and final values spinor vector differ after parallel transport around closed denoted knowledge the holonomies equivalent knowledge the gauge holonomies can also associated with under gauss law these transform for closed loop take the trace that putting and summing obtain the trace holonomy around closed loop and written and called wilson thus wilson loop are gauge the explicit form the holonomy where the curve along which the holonomy and parameter along the denotes path ordering meaning factors for smaller values appear the and are matrices that satisfy the algebra the pauli matrices satisfy the above turns out that there are infinitely many more examples sets matrices that satisfy these where each set comprises matrices with and where non these can thought into two more examples lower they are called different irreducible representations the algebra the most fundamental representation being the pauli the holonomy labelled half integer according the irreducible representation the use wilson loops explicitly solves the gauss gauge handle the spatial diffeomorphism constraint need over the loop representation wilson loops form basis can formally expand any gauss gauge invariant function this called the loop can see the analogy with going the momentum representation quantum see position and momentum space there one has basis states labelled number and one expands and works with the coefficients the expansion the inverse loop transform defined this defines the loop given operator the connection one should define the corresponding operator the loop representation where defined the usual inverse loop transformation formula giving the action the operator terms the action the operator then obtained equating the with the with substituted into namely where mean the operator but with the reverse factor ordering remember from simple quantum mechanics where the product operators reversed under evaluate the action this operator the wilson loop calculation the connection representation and rearranging the result manipulation purely terms loops one should remember that when considering the action the wilson loop one should choose the operator one wishes transform with the opposite factor ordering the one chosen for its action wavefunctions this gives the physical meaning the operator for example corresponded spatial then this can thought keeping the connection field where while performing spatial diffeomorphism instead therefore the meaning spatial diffeomorphism the argument the loop representation can then solve the spatial diffeomorphism constraint considering functions loops that are invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms the loop that construct what mathematicians call knot invariants this opened unexpected connection between knot theory and quantum what about the hamiltonian let back the connection any collection intersecting wilson loops satisfy quantum hamiltonian this can seen from the with particular ordering terms and replacing the action the quantum hamiltonian constraint wilson loop when derivative taken brings down the tangent the have something like however symmetric the indices and this vanishes this assumes that not discontinuous anywhere and the tangent vector now let back the loop consider wavefunctions that vanish the loop has discontinuities and that are knot such functions solve the gauss the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and the hamiltonian thus have identified infinite set exact only solutions all the equations quantum general this generated lot interest the approach and eventually led geometric the need for intersecting wilson loops and spin network states the easiest geometric quantity the let choose coordinates that the surface characterized the area small parallelogram the surface the product length each side times where the angle between the say one edge given the vector and the other then from this get the area the surface given where and the determinant the metric induced this can rewritten the standard formula for inverse matrix note the similarity between this and the expression for but ashtekar variables have therefore according the rules canonical quantization should promote the triads quantum turns out that the area can promoted well defined quantum operator despite the fact that are dealing with product two functional derivatives and worse have root contend with putting talk being the note that this quantity important the final formula for the area simply state the result where the sum over all edges the wilson loop that pierce the surface the formula for the volume region given the quantization the volume proceeds the same way with the take the and each time bring down the tangent vector when the volume operator acts intersecting wilson loops the result quantum states with zero volume must therefore involve given that the symmetric summation taken over the formula for the volume would need least intersections with three coplanar lines actually turns out that one needs least valent vertices for the volume operator now consider wilson loops with assume the real representation where the gauge group wilson loops are over complete basis there are identities relating different wilson these come about from the fact that wilson loops are based matrices the and these matrices satisfy the called mandelstam given any two matrices and easy check this implies that given two loops and that will where mean the loop traversed the opposite direction and means the loop obtained going around the loop and then along see figure spin networks are certain linear combinations intersecting wilson loops designed address the over completeness introduced the mandelstam wilson loops mentioned above the holonomy tells you how propagate test spin half spin network state assigns amplitude set spin half particles tracing out path merging and these are described spin networks the edges are labelled spins together with the vertices which are prescription for how sum over different ways the spins are the sum over rerouting are chosen such make the form the intertwiner invariant under gauss gauge real modern analysis and lqg hamiltonian constraint lqg let into more detail about the technical difficulties associated with using with variables one uses complex connection and the relevant gauge group actually and not non compact creates serious problems for the rigorous construction the necessary mathematical the group the other hand compact and the relevant constructions needed have been mentioned because variables are complex results complex general recover the real theory one has impose what are known the reality these require that the densitized triad real and that the real part the ashtekar connection equals the compatible spin connection the compatibility condition being determined the desitized the expression for compatible connection rather complicated and such polynomial formula enters through the back before state the next difficulty should give tensor density weight transforms like ordinary tensor except that additional the power the jacobian appears turns out that general construct diffeomorphism violating operator corresponding the reason that the rescaled hamiltonian constraint scalar density weight two while can shown that only scalar densities weight one have chance result well defined thus one forced work with the original density hamiltonian however this polynomial and the whole virtue the complex variables all the solutions constructed for hamiltonian constraint only vanished for finite regularization however this violates spatial diffeomorphism without the implementation and solution the hamiltonian constraint progress can made and reliable predictions are overcome the first problem one works with the configuration variable where real pointed out who introduced real variables some time after variables the guass law and the spatial diffeomorphism constraints are the real ashtekar variables the hamiltonian the complicated relationship between and the desitized triads causes serious problems upon with the choice that the second more complicated term made however mentioned above reappears the reality also still have the problem the factor thiemann was able make work for real first could simplify the troublesome using the identity where the the and can promoted well defined operators the loop representation and the poisson bracket replaced commutator upon this takes care the first turns out that similar trick can used treat the second one introduces the quantity and notes that are then able write the reason the quantity easier work with the time quantization that can written where have used that the integrated densitized trace the extrinsic time derivative the the long history canonical quantum gravity formulating the hamiltonian constraint quantum operator wheeler dewitt equation mathematically rigorous manner has been formidable was the loop representation that mathematically well defined hamiltonian constraint was finally formulated leave more details its construction the article hamiltonian constraint lqg this together with the quantum versions the gauss law and spatial diffeomorphism constrains written the loop representation are the central equations lqg modern canonical quantum general finding the states that are annihilated these constraints the physical and finding the corresponding physical inner and observables the main goal the technical side very important aspect the hamiltonian operator that only acts vertices consequence this that hamiltonian like annihilates intersecting loops except now not just formal and has rigorous mathematical more its action zero least vertices valence three and greater and results linear combination new spin networks where the original graph has been modified the addition lines each vertex together and change the labels the adjacent links the solving the quantum constraints spectrum dual space rigged hilbert space least all the quantum constraint equations and for the physical inner product make physical before move the constraints lets consider certain start with kinematic hilbert space equipped with inner product the kinematic inner product say have constraints whose zero eigenvalues lie their discrete spectrum solutions the first correspond subspace the kinematic hilbert there will projection operator mapping onto the kinematic inner product structure easily employed provide the inner product structure after solving this first the new inner product simply they are based the same inner product and are states normalizable with respect the zero point not contained the point spectrum all the there then trivial solution the system quantum constraint equations for all for example the zero eigenvalue the operator lies the continuous spectrum but the formal not normalizable the kinematic inner and does not belong the kinematic hilbert space these cases take dense subset intuitively this means either any point either arbitrarily close point with very good convergence properties and consider its dual space intuitively these map elements onto finite complex numbers linear then contains distributional the constraint operator then implemented this larger dual which contains distributional under the adjoint action the one looks for solutions this larger this comes the price that the solutions must given new hilbert space inner product with respect which they are normalizable see article rigged hilbert space this case have generalized projection operator the new space cannot use the above formula for the new inner product instead the new inner product given the simply modification the the generalized projector known rigging let move additional complications will arise from the fact the constraint algebra not lie algebra due the bracket between two hamiltonian the gauss law solved the use spin network they provide basis for the kinematic hilbert space the spatial diffeomorphism constraint has been the induced inner product not purrsue the has very simple description terms spinor network given two spin networks and with associated spin network states and the inner product and are related each other spatial diffeomorphism and zero the hamiltonian constraint maps diffeomorphism invariant states onto diffeomorphism invaiant states does not preserve the diffeomorphism hilbert space this unavoidable consequence the operator this means that you cant just solve the diffeomorphism constraint and then the hamiltonian this problem can circumvented the introduction the master with its trivial operator one then able principle construct the physical inner product from spin foams spin network spin foam model crane model loop quantum gravity spin network represents quantum the gravitational field dimensional the set all possible spin networks more that equivalence classes spin networks under constitutes basis lqg hilbert spin foam topological structure made out dimensional faces that represents one the configurations that must summed obtain path integral functional description quantum closely related loop quantum spin foam derived from the hamiltonian constraint operator the hamiltonian constraint generates evolution solving the hamiltonian constraint should tell how quantum states evolve from initial spin network state final spin network one approach solving the hamiltonian constraint starts with what called the dirac delta function this rather singular function the real denoted that zero everywhere except but whose integral finite and can represented fourier one can employ the idea the delta function impose the condition that the hamiltonian constraint should obvious that zero only when for all using this can out solutions the hamiltonian using this the physical inner product formally given where are the initial spin network and the final spin with analogy the fourier integral given this projector can formally written the exponential can expanded and each time hamiltonian operator acts does adding new edge the the summation over different sequences actions can visualized summation over different histories interaction the evolution sending the initial spin network the final spin this then naturally gives rise the complex combinatorial set faces that join along which turn join underlying the spin foam evolve forward initial spin network sweeping out the action the hamiltonian constraint operator produce new planar surface starting the are able use the action the hamiltonian constraint the vertex spin network state associate amplitude each interaction analogy feynman diagrams see figure this opens way trying directly link canonical lqg path integral now just spin networks describe quantum each configuration contributing these path sums over describe quantum because their resemblance soap foams and the way they are labeled john baez gave these quantum the name spin path integral spin foam there are however severe difficulties with this particular for example the hamiltonian operator not adjoint and the exponential cant well defined the most serious problem that the are not mutually can then shown the formal quantity cannot even define projector the master constraint see does not suffer from these problems and such offers way connecting the canonical theory the path integral spin foams from theory turns out there are alternative routes formulating the path however their connection the hamiltonian formalism less one way start with the called theory this simpler theory general has local degrees freedom and such depends only topological aspects the theory what known topological field theory surprisingly turns out that general relativity can obtained from theory imposing theory involves field and one chooses the field the product two tetrads tetrads are like triads but four spacetime one recovers general the condition that the field given the product two tetrads called the simplicity the spin foam dynamics the topological field theory well given the spin foam amplitudes for this simple one then tries implement the simplicity conditions obtain path integral for general the trivial task constructing spin foam model then reduced the question how this simplicity constraint should imposed the quantum the first attempt this was the famous barrett crane model however this model was shown for example there did not seem enough degrees freedom ensure the correct classical has been argued that the simplicity constraint was imposed too strongly the quantum level and should only imposed the sense expectation values just with the lorenz gauge condition the gupta bleuler formalism quantum electrodynamics new models have now been put sometimes motivated imposing the simplicity conditions weaker another difficulty here that spin foams are defined discretization while this presents problems for topological field theory has local degrees presents problems for this known the problem triangularization modern formulation spin foams just imposing the classical simplicity constraint recovers general relativity from one expects appropriate quantum simplicity constraint will recover quantum gravity from quantum much progress has been made with regard this issue pereira and rovelli and freidal and krasnov defining spin foam interaction amplitudes with much better attempt make contact between spin foam and the canonical formulation lqg has been spin foam derived from the master constraint operator see spin foams from consistent discretisations the classical limit what the semiclassical correspondence principle classical limit the classical limit correspondence limit the ability physical theory approximate recover classical mechanics when considered over special values its the classical limit used with physical theories that predict classical physics the correspondence principle states that the behavior systems described the theory quantum mechanics the old quantum theory reproduces classical physics the limit large quantum numbers other says that for large orbits and for large energies quantum calculations must agree with classical the principle was formulated niels bohr though had previously made use early developing his model the atom there are two basic requirements establishing the classical limit any quantum reproduction the poisson brackets the diffeomorphism constraints the case general this extremely important noted the poisson bracket algebra formed between the constraints themselves completely determines the classical this analogous establishing ehrenfest theorem the specification complete set classical observables whose corresponding operators see complete set commuting observables for the quantum mechanical definition complete set when acted appropriate classical states reproduce the same classical variables with small quantum corrections subtle point that states that are classical for one class observables may not classical for different class observables this may easily for ordinary quantum mechanics for particle but general relativity this becomes highly trivial problem will see why might lqg not have general relativity its semiclassical any candidate theory quantum gravity must able reproduce theory general relativity classical limit quantum theory this not guaranteed because feature quantum field theories which that they have different these are analogous the different phases that come about the thermodynamical limit statistical just different phases are physically are different sectors quantum field may turn out that lqg belongs unphysical sector one which you not recover general relativity the semi classical limit fact there might not any physical sector theorems establishing the uniqueness the loop representation defined ashtekar certain concrete realization hilbert space and associated operators reproducing the correct loop algebra the realization that everybody was have been given two groups okolow sahlmann and and christian before this result was established was not known whether there could other examples hilbert spaces with operators invoking the same loop other not equivalent the one that had been used these uniqueness theorems imply others exist and lqg does not have the correct semiclassical limit then this would mean the end the loop representation quantum gravity difficulties checking the semiclassical limit lqg there are difficulties trying establish lqg gives theory general relativity the semi classical there are number particular difficulties establishing the classical limit there operator corresponding infinitesimal spacial diffeomorphisms not surprising that the theory has generator infinitesimal spatial predicts spatial geometry has discrete compare the situation condensed instead must approximated finite spatial diffeomorphisms and the poisson bracket structure the classical theory not exactly this problem can circumvented with the introduction the called master constraint see there the problem reconciling the discrete combinatorial nature the quantum states with the continuous nature the fields the classical there are serious difficulties arising from the structure the poisson brackets involving the spatial diffeomorphism and hamiltonian the algebra hamiltonian constraints does not proportional sum over infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms have just does not exist the quantum where the coefficients proportionality are not constants but have trivial phase space dependence such does not form lie algebra however the situation much improved the introduction the master the classical machinery developed far only appropriate changing however thiemann hamiltonian constraint changing operator the new graph generates has degrees freedom upon which the coherent state does not depend and their quantum fluctuations are not there also the that these coherent states are only defined the kimematic and now one has lift them the level and can shown that hamiltonian constraint required graph changing order resolve problem some the master constraint algebra however trivial and the requirement that graph changing can lifted and indeed graph changing master constraint operators have been formulating observables for classical general relativity formidable problem itself because its linear nature and time diffeomorphism fact systematic approximation scheme calculate observables has only been recently difficulties trying examine the semi classical limit the theory should not confused with having the wrong semi classical progress demonstrating lqg has the correct semiclassical limit much details here written concerning issue number above one can consider called weave states ordinary measurements geometric quantities are and planckian discreteness smoothed the fabric shirt distance smooth curved dimensional but closer inspection see that actually composed thousands dimensional linked the image space given lqg consider very large spin network formed very large number nodes and each planck scale but probed macroscopic appears dimensional continuous metric far the editor knows problem having classical machinery for graph changing operators the moment still out make contact with familiar low energy physics mandatory have develop approximation schemes both for the physical inner product and for dirac the spin foam models have been intensively studied can viewed avenues toward approximation schemes for the physical inner markopoulou adopted the idea noiseless subsystems attempt solve the problem the low energy limit background independent quantum gravity theories the idea has even led the intriguing possibility matter the standard model being identified with emergent degrees freedom from some versions lqg see section lqg and related research programs improved dynamics and the master constraint hamiltonian quantum hamiltonian constraint lqg the master constraint thiemann master constraint should not confused with the master equation with random the master constraint programme for loop quantum gravity was proposed classically equivalent way impose the infinite number hamiltonian constraint equations being continuous terms single master which involves the square the constraints note that were infinitely many whereas the master constraint only clear that vanishes then the infinitely many conversely all the vanish then does therefore they are the master constraint involves appropriate averaging over all space and invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms invariant under spatial shifts summation over all such spatial shifts quantity that transforms hence its poisson bracket with the spacial diffeomorphism invariant also obviously any quantity poisson commutes with and the master constraint being single satisfies also have the usual algebra between spatial this represents dramatic simplification the poisson bracket and raises new hope understanding the dynamics and establishing the classical initial objection the use the master constraint was that first sight did not seem encode information about the because the mater constraint quadratic the when you compute its poisson bracket with any the result proportional the therefore always vanishes when the constraints are imposed and such does not select out particular phase space however was realized that the condition equivalent being dirac the master constraint does capture information about the because its significance this known the master that the master constraint poisson algebra honest lie algebra opens the possibility using certain know group order construct solutions the infinite number hamiltonian physical inner product thereon and dirac observables via what known refined algebraic quantization raq testing the master constraint the constraints their primitive form are rather this was the reason for integrating them over test functions obtain smeared however would appear that the equation for the master given even more singular involving the product two primitive constraints although integrated over squaring the constraint dangerous could lead worsened ultraviolent behaviour the corresponding operator and hence the master constraint programme must approached with due doing the master constraint programme has been satisfactorily tested number model systems with trivial constraint free and interacting field the master constraint for lqg was established genuine positive adjoint operator and the physical hilbert space lqg was shown obvious consistency test lqg must pass viable theory quantum general applications the master constraint the master constraint has been employed attempts approximate the physical inner product and define more rigorous path the consistent discretizations approach application the master constraint program construct the physical hilbert space the canonical spin foam from the master constraint turns out that the master constraint easily generalized incorporate the other then referred the extended master denoted can define the extended master constraint which imposes both the hamiltonian constraint and spatial diffeomorphism constraint single setting this single constraint zero equivalent and for all this constraint implements the spatial diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraint the same time the kinematic hilbert the physical inner product then defined spin foam representation this expression obtained splitting the parameter discrete steps and writing the spin foam description then follows from the application spin network resulting linear combination new spin networks whose graph and labels have been obviously approximation made truncating the value some finite advantage the extended master constraint that are working the kinematic level and far only here have access classical coherent moreover one can find none graph changing versions this master constraint which are the only type operators appropriate for these coherent algebraic quantum gravity the master constraint programme has evolved into fully combinatorial treatment gravity known algebraic quantum gravity while aqg inspired differs drastically from because aqg there fundamentally topology differential structure background independent more generalized sense and could possibly have something say about topology this new formulation quantum gravity existing semiclassical which only viable for graph changing can and progress has been made establishing has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy see book for physical applications lqg

cosmological achievements lqc have been the resolution the big bang the prediction big and natural mechanism for inflation lqc models share features lqg and useful toy however the results obtained are subject the usual restriction that truncated classical then might not display the true behaviour the full theory due artificial suppression degrees freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations the full has been argued that singularity avoidance lqc are mechanisms only available these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance the full theory can still obtained but more subtle feature loop quantum gravity phenomenology quantum gravity effects are notoriously difficult measure because the planck length incredibly however recently physicists have started consider the possibility measuring quantum gravity mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave background independent scattering amplitudes loop quantum gravity formulated independent spacetime assumed but rather built the states theory themselves however scattering amplitudes are derived from point functions correlation function quantum field and formulated conventional quantum field are functions points background the relation between the independent formalism and the conventional formalism quantum field theory given spacetime far from and far from obvious how recover energy quantities from the full independent one would like derive the point functions the theory from the independent order compare them with the standard perturbative expansion quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct energy strategy for addressing this problem has been the idea study the boundary namely path integral over finite time seen function the boundary value the conventional quantum field this boundary amplitude defined and codes the physical information the does quantum gravity but fully independent generally covariant definition point functions can then based the idea that the distance between physical points arguments the point function determined the state the gravitational field the boundary the spacetime region progress has been made calculating background independent scattering amplitudes this way with the use spin this way extract physical information from the claims have reproduced the correct behaviour for graviton scattering amplitudes and have recovered classical gravity have been have calculated law starting from world with space and carlo gravitons string super extra dimensions lqg graviton string theory supersymmetry klein theory supergravity some quantum theories gravity posit quantum field that giving rise string theory and quantum field one starts with quantized excitations top classically fixed these theories are thus described background the excitations are the quanta the associated fields gravitons string claim theory quantum gravity its prediction massless particle the whose interactions the classical limit reproduce general while string theory background the choice like gauge does not affect the physical this not the however for quantum field which give different predictions for different loop quantum like general manifestly background eliminating the some redundant background required string loop quantum like string also aims overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences quantum field lqg never introduces background and excitations living this lqg does not use gravitons building instead one expects that one may recover kind semiclassical limit weak field limit where something like gravitons will show contrast any other qft and string theory where the gravitons are the fundamental mathematical and entities lqg the gravitons are not fundamental but only considered certain limited lqg differs from string theory that formulated and dimensions and without supersymmetry klein theory extra while the latter requires both there experimental evidence date that supports string predictions supersymmetry and klein theory extra paper dialog quantum carlo rovelli regards the fact lqg formulated dimensions and without supersymmetry strength the theory represents the most parsimonious explanation consistent with current experimental over its rival peter woit not even wrong and lee smolin the trouble with physics also regards theory conflict with current known experimental since lqg has been formulated dimensions with and without and theory requires supersymmetry and dimensions direct comparison between the two has not been possible extend mainstream lqg formalism dimensional general relativity with supersymmetry and klein extradimensions should experimental evidence establish their would therefore desirable have dimensional supergravity loop quantizations disposal order compare these fact series recent papers have been published attempting just most thiemann have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity higher will interesting compare these results the corresponding super string april lhc has failed find evidence supersymmetry klein theory extra which has encouraged lqg shaposhnikov his paper there new physics between electroweak and planck has proposed the neutrino minimal standard which claims the most parsimonious theory standard model extended with plus and that extra gut and string theory

provide framework connect the path integral and canonical approaches quantum they may help reconcile the spin foam and canonical loop representation recent research chris duston and matilde marcolli introduces topology change via topspin problems and comparisons with alternative approaches list unsolved problems physics some the major unsolved problems physics are meaning that existing theories seem incapable explaining certain observed phenomenon experimental the others are meaning that there difficulty creating experiment test proposed theory investigate phenomenon greater can quantum mechanics and general relativity realized fully consistent theory perhaps quantum field spacetime fundamentally continuous would consistent theory involve force mediated hypothetical product discrete structure spacetime itself loop quantum are there deviations from the predictions general relativity very small very large scales other extreme circumstances that flow from quantum gravity the theory lqg one possible solution the problem quantum string theory there are substantial differences for string theory also addresses unification the understanding all known forces and particles manifestations single postulating extra dimensions and far unobserved additional particles and contrary lqg based only quantum theory and general relativity and its scope limited understanding the quantum aspects the gravitational the other the consequences lqg are because they fundamentally change the nature space and time and provide tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture quantum presently semiclassical limit recovering general relativity has been shown this means remains unproven that description spacetime the planck scale has the right continuum limit described general relativity with possible quantum specifically the dynamics the theory encoded the hamiltonian constraint but there candidate hamiltonian other technical problems include finding off shell
