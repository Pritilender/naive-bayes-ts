studies textbooks for graduate studies other specialised subareas scope there are several distinct branches mathematical and these roughly correspond particular historical geometrically advanced formulations classical mechanics the abstract and advanced formulation newtonian mechanics adopting the lagrangian mechanics and the hamiltonian mechanics even the presence both formulations are embodied the called analytical mechanics for discover the deep interplay the notion symmetry and that conserved quantities during the dynamical stated within the most elementary formulation noether theorem these approaches and ideas can have been extended other areas physics statistical mechanics continuum mechanics classical field theory and quantum field theory moreover they have provided several examples and basic ideas differential geometry the theory vector bundles and several notions symplectic geometry partial differential equations the theory partial differential equations and the related areas variational calculus fourier analysis potential theory and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical these were developed intensively from the second half the eighteenth century for alembert euler and lagrange until the physical applications these developments include hydrodynamics celestial mechanics continuum mechanics elasticity theory acoustics thermodynamics electricity magnetism and aerodynamics quantum theory the theory atomic spectra later quantum mechanics developed almost concurrently with the mathematical fields linear algebra the spectral theory operators operator algebras and more functional analysis nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schr dinger operators and has connections atomic and molecular physics quantum information theory another relativity and quantum relativistic theories the special and general theories relativity require rather different type mathematics this was group theory which played important role both quantum field theory and differential geometry this however gradually supplemented topology and functional analysis the mathematical description cosmological well quantum field theory phenomena this area both homological algebra and category theory are important statistical mechanics statistical mechanics forms separate which includes the theory phase transitions relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics its quantum and closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts probability theory there are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics particular statistical usage the usage the term mathematical sometimes idiosyncratic certain parts mathematics that initially arose from the development physics are considered parts mathematical while other closely related fields for ordinary differential equations and symplectic geometry are generally viewed purely mathematical whereas dynamical systems and hamiltonian mechanics belong mathematical mathematical theoretical physics the term mathematical sometimes used denote research aimed studying and solving problems inspired physics thought experiments within mathematically rigorous framework this mathematical physics covers very broad academic realm distinguished only the blending pure mathematics and physics although related theoretical physics mathematical physics this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour the same type found the other theoretical physics emphasizes the links observations and experimental physics which often requires theoretical physicists and mathematical physicists the more general use heuristic intuitive and approximate such arguments are not considered rigorous arguably rigorous mathematical physics closer and theoretical physics closer this reflected mathematical physicists are often members the mathematics such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories because the required level mathematical these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered already however they can sometimes show but neither commonly nor that the previous solution was incorrect too issues about attempts infer the second law thermodynamics from statistical mechanics are other examples concerns all the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures special and general relativity sagnac effect and einstein synchronisation the effort put physical theories mathematically rigorous footing has inspired many mathematical for the development quantum mechanics and some aspects functional analysis parallel each other many the mathematical study quantum quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results operator algebras the attempt construct rigorous quantum field theory has also brought about progress fields such representation theory use geometry and topology plays important role string theory prominent mathematical physicists prominent

strong wightman stephen hawking edward witten arthur jaffe barry simon peter higgs leonard susskind ashoke sen and rudolf haag the roots mathematical physics can traced back the likes archimedes greece ptolemy egypt alhazen iraq and biruni persia the first decade the amateur astronomer nicolaus copernicus proposed heliocentrism and published treatise not quite copernicus merely sought simplify astronomy and achieve orbits more perfect stated aristotelian physics the intrinsic motion fifth element the quintessence universal essence known greek aither for the english pure air that was the pure substance beyond the sublunary sphere and thus was celestial pure the german johannes kepler tycho brahe modified copernican orbits ellipses however formalized the equations laws planetary motion enthusiastic galileo galilei his book the assayer asserted that the book written his book upon his telescopic supported having introducing galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology refuting aristotelian physics galilei book discourse two new sciences established law equal free fall well the principles inertial founding the central concepts what would become classical mechanics the galilean law inertia well the principle galilean invariance also called galilean for any object experiencing there empirical justification knowing only its being relative rest relative motion rest motion with respect another ren descartes adopted galilean principles and developed complete system heliocentric cosmology anchored the principle vortex cartesian physics whose widespread acceptance brought demise aristotelian descartes sought formalize mathematical reasoning and developed cartesian coordinates for geometrically plotting locations space and marking their progressions along the flow newtonian and post newtonian isaac newton developed new including calculus and several numerical methods such newton method solve problems newton theory published modeled three galilean laws motion along with law universal gravitation framework absolute space hypothesized newton physically real entity euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely all while presuming absolute time supposedly justifying knowledge absolute the motion with respect absolute the principle galilean relativity was merely implicit theory having ostensibly reduced keplerian celestial laws motion well galilean terrestrial laws motion unifying newton achieved great mathematic rigor theoretical the the swiss daniel bernoulli made contributions fluid dynamics and vibrating strings the swiss leonhard euler did special work variational calculus dynamics fluid and other also notable was the born joseph louis lagrange for work analytical mechanics formulated the called lagrangian mechanics and variational major contribution the formulation analytical dynamics called hamiltonian dynamics was also made the irish astronomer and william rowan hamilton hamiltonian dynamics had played important role the formulation modern theories physics including field theory and quantum the french mathematical physicist joseph fourier introduced the notion fourier series solve the heat equation giving rise new approach handle partial differential equations means integral transforms into the early the french pierre simon laplace made paramount contributions mathematical astronomy potential theory and probability theory sim denis poisson worked analytical mechanics and potential germany carl friedrich gauss made key contributions the theoretical foundations electricity magnetism mechanics and fluid dynamics couple decades ahead publication particle theory the dutch christiaan huygens developed the wave theory published thomas young slit experiment revealed interference pattern though light were and thus wave theory well inference that that light waves were vibrations the luminiferous aether was jean augustin fresnel modeled hypothetical behavior the michael faraday introduced the theoretical concept not action mid the scottish james clerk maxwell reduced electricity and magnetism electromagnetic field whittled down others the four maxwell equations initially optics was found consequent later radiation and then known electromagnetic spectrum were found also consequent this electromagnetic the english physicist lord rayleigh worked sound the irishmen william rowan hamilton george gabriel stokes and lord kelvin did lot major stokes was leader optics and fluid kelvin made substantial discoveries thermodynamics hamilton did notable work analytical mechanics finding out new and powerful approach nowadays known hamiltonian mechanics very relevant contributions this approach are due his german colleague carl gustav jacobi particular referring the called canonical transformations the german hermann von helmholtz greatly contributed electromagnetism waves fluids and the united the pioneering work josiah willard gibbs became the basis for statistical mechanics fundamental theoretical results this area were achieved the german ludwig boltzmann together these individuals laid the foundations electromagnetic fluid and statistical relativistic the prominent was the paradox that observer within electromagnetic field measured approximately constant speed regardless the speed relative other objects within the electromagnetic thus although the speed was continually lost relative the electromagnetic was preserved relative other objects the electromagnetic and yet violation galilean invariance within physical interactions among objects was electromagnetic field was modeled oscillations the aether physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted aether drift shifting the electromagnetic explaining the missing speed relative physicists mathematical process translate the positions one reference frame predictions positions another reference all plotted cartesian coordinates had been the galilean transformation which was newly replaced with lorentz transformation modeled the dutch hendrik lorentz experimentalists michelson and morley failed detect aether however was hypothesized that motion into the aether prompted too modeled the lorentz contraction hypotheses the aether thus kept electromagnetic field aligned with the principle galilean invariance across all inertial frames reference while theory motion was the gauss contributions non euclidean geometry geometry curved laid the groundwork for the subsequent development riemannian geometry bernhard riemann austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher ernest mach criticized postulated absolute mathematician jules henri questioned even absolute pierre duhem published devastating criticism the foundation theory also albert einstein published special theory relativity newly explaining both the electromagnetic invariance and galilean invariance discarding all hypotheses including aether refuting the framework absolute space and absolute time special relativity states relative space and relative time whereby length contracts and time dilates along the travel pathway object experiencing kinetic einstein former professor hermann minkowski modeled space together with the axis time treating the temporal axis like fourth spatial altogether and declared the imminent demise the separation space and einstein initially called this superfluous but later used minkowski spacetime great elegance general theory relativity extending invariance all reference whether perceived inertial and thanked then general relativity replaces cartesian coordinates with gaussian coordinates and replaces claimed empty yet euclidean space traversed instantly vector hypothetical gravitational instant action distance with gravitational field the gravitational field minkowski spacetime the topology einstein aether modeled lorentzian manifold that curves geometrically according the riemann curvature tensor the vicinity either mass special special case general even massless energy exerts gravitational effect its mass equivalence locally curving the geometry the unified dimensions space and quantum another revolutionary development the twentieth century has been quantum theory which emerged from the seminal contributions max planck black body radiation and work the photoelectric effect this followed heuristic framework devised
