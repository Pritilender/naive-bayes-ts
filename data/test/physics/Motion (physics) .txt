physics	motion navigation search physics motion change position object with respect time and its reference motion typically described terms displacement direction velocity acceleration and time motion observed attaching frame reference body and measuring its change position relative that the position body not changing with the time with respect given frame reference the body said rest motionless immobile stationary have constant time invariant position motion cannot change unless acted upon force described newton first law momentum quantity which used for measuring motion momentum directly related the mass and velocity and the total momentum all objects isolated system one not affected external does not change with described the law conservation momentum the study motion deals with the

bernoulli cauchy classical mechanics used for describing the motion macroscopic objects from projectiles parts machinery well astronomical objects such spacecraft planets stars and galaxies produces very accurate results within these and one the oldest and largest subjects science engineering and technology classical mechanics fundamentally based newton laws motion these laws describe the relationship between the forces acting body and the motion that they were first compiled sir isaac newton his work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica first published july his three laws the absence net external force body either rest moves with constant the net external force body equal the mass that body times its acceleration alternatively the acceleration directly proportional the force causing and inversely proportional the whenever one body exerts force onto second the second body exerts the force the first and are equal magnitude and opposite newton three laws along with his newton law motion which were the first accurately provide mathematical model for understanding orbiting bodies outer space this explanation unified the motion celestial bodies and motion objects classical mechanics was later further enhanced albert special relativity and general relativity motion objects with high velocity approaching the speed light general relativity employed handle gravitational motion deeper quantum mechanics quantum mechanics quantum mechanics set principles describing physical reality the atomic level matter molecules and atoms and the subatomic electrons protons and even smaller particles these descriptions include the simultaneous like and like behavior both matter and radiation energy this described the wave particle duality citation needed classical accurate measurements and predictions the state objects can such location and velocity the quantum due the heisenberg uncertainty principle the complete state subatomic such its location and cannot simultaneously citation needed addition describing the motion atomic level quantum mechanics useful understanding some large scale phenomenon such superfluidity superconductivity and biological systems including the function smell receptors and the structures proteins citation needed list imperceptible human motions humans like all known things the are constant however aside from obvious movements the various external body parts and locomotion humans are motion variety ways which are more difficult perceive many these imperceptible are only perceivable with the help special tools and careful the larger scales imperceptible are difficult for humans perceive for two newton laws motion particularly inertia which prevent humans from feeling motions mass which they are and the lack obvious frame reference which would allow individuals easily see that they are the smaller scales these motions are too small for humans sense universe spacetime the fabric the actually expanding essentially everything the universe stretching like rubber band this motion the most obscure not physical motion but rather change the very nature the the primary source verification this expansion was provided edwin hubble who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from hubble law predicted universal galaxy the milky way galaxy moving through space many astronomers believe the milky way moving approximately relative the observed locations other nearby another reference frame provided the cosmic microwave background this frame reference indicates that the milky way moving around sun the milky way rotating around its dense galactic center thus the sun moving circle within the galaxy gravity away from the central bulge outer the typical stellar velocity between and about million solar system all planets and their moons move with the thus the solar system earth the earth rotating spinning around its axis this evidenced day and night the equator the earth has eastward velocity the earth orbiting around the sun orbital revolution complete orbit around the sun takes one year about days averages speed about continents the theory plate tectonics tells that the continents are drifting convection currents within the mantle causing them move across the surface the planet the slow speed approximately inch per however the velocities plates range the moving plates are the oceanic with the cocos plate advancing rate and the pacific plate moving the other the moving plate the eurasian plate progressing typical rate about internal body the human heart constantly contracting move blood throughout the through larger veins and arteries the body blood has been found travel approximately though considerable variation and peak flows the venae cavae have been found between and the smooth muscles hollow internal organs are the most familiar would peristalsis which where digested food forced throughout the digestive tract though different foods travel through the body average speed through the human small intestine typically some sound audible any given when the vibration these sound waves reaches the ear drum moves response and allows the sense hearing the human lymphatic system constantly moving excess fluids lipids and immune system related products around the the lymph fluid has been found move through lymph capillary the skin approximately cells the cells the human body have many structures which move throughout cytoplasmic streaming way which cells move molecular substances throughout the cytoplasm various motor proteins work molecular motors within cell and move along the surface various cellular substrates such microtubuless motor proteins are typically powered the hydrolysis adenosine triphosphate and convert chemical energy into mechanical vesicles propelled motor proteins have been found have velocity approximately particles according the laws thermodynamics all particles matter are constant random motion long the temperature above absolute zero thus the molecules and atoms which make the human body are colliding and this motion can detected higher which represent greater kinetic energy the feel warm humans whom sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched their similarly when lower temperature objects are the senses perceive the transfer heat away from the body feeling subatomic particles within each electrons exist area around the this area called the electron cloud according model the electrons have high velocity and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need electrons about the electron cloud strict paths the same way planets orbit the then electrons would required speeds which far exceed the speed however there reason that one must confine self this strict that electrons move paths the same way macroscopic objects rather one can conceptualize electrons that capriciously exist within the bounds the electron inside the atomic nucleus the protons and neutrons are also probably moving around due the electrical repulsion the protons and the presence angular momentum both light speed light light propagates often
