strassmann and explained theoretically january lise meitner and her nephew otto robert frisch frisch named the process analogy with biological fission living exothermic reaction which can release large amounts energy both electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy the fragments heating the bulk material where fission takes order for fission produce the total binding energy the resulting elements must greater than that the starting fission form nuclear transmutation because the resulting fragments are not the same element the original the two nuclei produced are most often comparable but slightly different typically with mass ratio products about for common fissile isotopes most fissions are binary fissions producing two charged but occasionally times per events three positively charged fragments are ternary fission the smallest these fragments ternary processes ranges size from proton argon fission encountered the modern world usually deliberately produced made nuclear

probabilistic and somewhat chaotic distinguishes fission from purely tunnelling processes such proton emission alpha decay and cluster decay which give the same products each nuclear fission produces

occur without neutron bombardment type radioactive decay this type fission called spontaneous fission rare except few heavy engineered nuclear essentially all nuclear fission occurs nuclear reaction driven process that results from the collision two subatomic nuclear subatomic particle collides with atomic nucleus and causes changes nuclear reactions are thus driven the mechanics not the relatively constant exponential decay and half life characteristic spontaneous radioactive many types nuclear reactions are currently nuclear fission differs importantly from other types nuclear that can amplified and sometimes controlled via nuclear chain reaction one type general chain reaction such free neutrons released each fission event can trigger yet more which turn release more neutrons and cause more the chemical element isotopes that can sustain fission chain reaction are called nuclear fuels and are said fissile the most common nuclear fuels are the isotope uranium with atomic mass and use nuclear and the isotope plutonium with atomic mass these fuels break apart into bimodal range chemical elements with atomic masses centering near and fission products most nuclear fuels undergo spontaneous fission only very decaying instead mainly via alpha beta decay chain over periods millennia eons nuclear reactor nuclear the overwhelming majority fission events are induced bombardment with another which itself produced prior fission nuclear fissions fissile fuels are the result the nuclear excitation energy produced when fissile nucleus captures this resulting from the neutron result the attractive nuclear force acting between the neutron and enough deform the nucleus into lobed the point that nuclear fragments exceed the distances which the nuclear force can hold two groups charged nucleons and when this the two fragments complete their separation and then are driven further apart their mutually repulsive process which becomes irreversible with greater and greater similar process occurs fissionable isotopes such but order these isotopes require additional energy provided fast neutrons such those produced nuclear fusion thermonuclear weapons the liquid drop model the atomic nucleus predicts sized fission products outcome nuclear the more sophisticated nuclear shell model needed mechanistically explain the route the more energetically favorable which one fission product slightly smaller than the theory the fission based shell model has been formulated maria goeppert mayer the most common fission process binary and produces the fission products noted and however the binary process happens merely because the most anywhere from fissions per nuclear process called ternary fission produces three positively charged fragments plus and the smallest

fusion however this process cannot happen great extent nuclear too small fraction the fission neutrons produced any type fission have enough energy efficiently fission fission neutrons have mode

with additional mev energy over isotope the same element with even number neutrons such with neutrons this extra binding energy made available result the mechanism neutron pairing effects this extra

necessary energy supplied absorption any either the slow fast variety the former are used moderated nuclear and the latter are used fast neutron reactors and noted the subgroup fissionable elements that may fissioned efficiently with their own fission neutrons thus potentially causing nuclear chain reaction relatively small amounts the pure are termed fissile examples fissile isotopes are and output typical fission events release about two hundred million energy for each fission the exact isotope which and whether not fissionable has only small impact the amount energy this can easily seen examining the curve binding energy image and noting that the average binding energy the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium around mev per looking further left the curve binding where the fission products cluster easily observed that the binding energy the fission products tends center around mev per thus any fission event isotope the range roughly mev released per nucleon the starting the fission slow neutron yields nearly identical energy the fission fast this energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides most chemical oxidation reactions such burning coal tnt release most few per nuclear fuel contains least million times more usable energy per unit mass than does chemical the energy nuclear fission released kinetic energy the fission products and

occasionally heavy water molten salts when uranium nucleus fissions into two daughter nuclei about percent the mass the uranium nucleus appears the fission energy for total mean fission energy typically mev appears the kinetic energy the daughter which fly apart about the speed due coulomb repulsion also average neutrons are with mean kinetic energy per neutron mev total the fission

both types radiation and the rest kinetic energy fission fragments this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding simple heat atomic this heat may serve raise the temperature the bomb core million kelvin and cause secondary emission soft which convert some this energy ionizing however nuclear the fission fragment kinetic energy remains temperature which itself causes little called neutron bombs enhanced radiation have been constructed which release larger fraction their energy ionizing radiation neutrons but these are all thermonuclear devices which rely the nuclear fusion stage produce the extra the energy dynamics pure fission bombs always remain about yield the total prompt result the total prompt fission energy amounts about mev the total energy which eventually released fission over the remaining released beta decays which have various but begin process the fission products and delayed gamma emissions associated with these beta for this delayed

the total energy fission released some time after the prompt delayed ionizing and the delayed ionizing energy about evenly divided between gamma and beta ray reactor that has been operating for some

reason that energy released antineutrinos not captured the reactor material and escapes directly through all materials including the nearly the speed and into interplanetary space the amount absorbed neutrino radiation ordinarily not classed ionizing because almost entirely not absorbed and therefore does not produce effects although the very rare neutrino event almost all the rest the radiation delayed beta and gamma eventually converted heat reactor core its some processes involving neutrons are notable for absorbing finally yielding energy for example neutron kinetic energy does not yield

reactor control because they give characteristic reaction time for the total nuclear reaction double the reaction run delayed critical zone which deliberately relies these neutrons for supercritical reaction one which each fission cycle yields more neutrons than without their the nuclear reaction would prompt critical and increase size faster than could controlled human this the first experimental atomic reactors would have run away dangerous and messy prompt critical before their operators could have manually shut them down for this designer enrico fermi included triggered control suspended which could automatically drop into the center chicago these delayed neutrons are captured without producing they produce heat product nuclei and binding energy fission product fission product yield fission there preference yield fragments with even proton which called the even effect the fragments charge however even effect observed fragment mass number distribution this result attributed nucleon pair breaking nuclear fission events the nuclei may break into any combination lighter but the most common event not fission equal mass nuclei about the most common event depending isotope and slightly unequal fission which one daughter nucleus has mass about and the other the remaining unequal fissions are energetically more favorable because this allows one product closer the energetic minimum near mass only quarter the average fissionable while the other nucleus with mass still not far out the range the most tightly bound nuclei another statement that the atomic binding energy curve slightly steeper the left mass than the right origin the active energy and the curve binding energy nuclear fission heavy elements produces energy because the specific binding energy binding energy per mass nuclei with atomic numbers and atomic masses close and greater than the specific binding energy very heavy that energy released when heavy nuclei are broken the total rest masses the fission products from single reaction less than the mass the original fuel nucleus the excess mass the invariant mass the energy that released photons gamma rays and kinetic energy the fission according the mass energy equivalence formula the variation specific binding energy with atomic number due the interplay the two fundamental forces acting the component nucleons protons and neutrons that make the nuclei are bound attractive nuclear force between which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between however the nuclear force acts only over relatively short ranges few nucleon diameters since follows exponentially decaying yukawa potential which makes insignificant longer the electrostatic repulsion longer since decays square that nuclei larger than about nucleons diameter reach point that the total electrostatic repulsion overcomes the nuclear force and causes them spontaneously for the same larger nuclei more than about eight nucleons are less tightly bound per unit mass than are smaller breaking large nucleus into two more sized nuclei releases the origin this energy the nuclear which sized nuclei allows act more because each nucleon has more neighbors which are within the short range attraction this thus less energy needed the smaller nuclei and the difference the state before set also because the short range the strong binding large stable nuclei must contain proportionally more neutrons than the lightest which are most stable with ratio protons and nuclei which have more than protons cannot stable unless they have more than equal number extra neutrons stabilize heavy elements because they add force binding which acts between all without adding proton fission products about the same ratio neutrons and protons their parent and are therefore usually unstable beta decay which changes neutrons because they have proportionally too many neutrons compared stable isotopes similar this tendency for fission product nuclei decay the fundamental cause the problem radioactive high level waste from nuclear fission products tend beta emitters emitting fast moving electrons conserve electric charge excess neutrons convert protons the product see fission products for description fission products sorted chain reactions uranium neutron nuclear chain reaction several heavy such uranium thorium and plutonium undergo both spontaneous fission form radioactive decay and induced fission form nuclear reaction elemental isotopes that undergo induced fission when struck free neutron are called fissionable isotopes that undergo fission when struck thermal slow moving neutron are also called fissile few particularly fissile and readily obtainable isotopes notably and are called nuclear fuels because they can sustain chain reaction and can obtained large enough quantities all fissionable and fissile isotopes undergo small amount spontaneous fission which releases few free neutrons into any sample nuclear such neutrons would escape rapidly from the fuel and become free neutron with mean lifetime about minutes before decaying protons and beta particles however neutrons almost invariably impact and are absorbed other nuclei the vicinity long before this happens newly created fission neutrons move about the speed and even moderated neutrons move about times the speed some neutrons will impact fuel nuclei and induce further releasing yet more enough nuclear fuel assembled one the escaping neutrons are sufficiently then these freshly emitted neutrons outnumber the neutrons that escape from the and sustained nuclear chain reaction will take assembly that supports sustained nuclear chain reaction called critical assembly the assembly almost entirely made nuclear critical mass the word critical refers cusp the behavior the differential equation that governs the number free neutrons present the less than critical mass then the amount neutrons determined radioactive decay but critical mass more then the amount neutrons controlled instead the physics the chain the actual mass critical mass nuclear fuel depends strongly the geometry and surrounding not all fissionable isotopes can sustain chain for the most abundant form fissionable but not undergoes induced fission when impacted energetic neutron with over mev kinetic however too few the neutrons produced fission are energetic enough induce further fissions chain reaction possible with this instead bombarding with slow neutrons causes absorb them becoming and decay beta emission which then decays again the same process that process used manufacture breeder reactors situ plutonium production also contributes the neutron chain reaction other types reactors after sufficient has been since also fissile element which serves estimated that half the power produced standard reactor produced the fission produced over the total cycle fuel fissionable non fissile isotopes can used fission energy source even without chain bombarding with fast neutrons induces releasing energy long the external neutron source this important effect all reactors where fast neutrons from the fissile isotope can cause the fission nearby which means that some small part the all nuclear especially fast breeder reactors that operate with energy that same fission effect used augment the energy released modern thermonuclear weapons jacketing the weapon with react with neutrons released nuclear fusion the center the fission reactors cooling towers philippsburg nuclear power plant germany critical fission reactors are the most common type nuclear reactor critical fission neutrons produced fission fuel atoms are used induce yet more sustain controllable amount energy devices that produce engineered but sustaining fission reactions are subcritical fission reactors such devices use radioactive decay particle accelerators trigger critical fission reactors are built for three primary which typically involve different engineering offs take advantage either the heat the neutrons produced the fission chain power reactors are intended produce heat for nuclear either part generating station local power system such nuclear submarine research reactors are intended produce neutrons activate radioactive sources for medical engineering other research breeder reactors are intended produce nuclear fuels bulk from more abundant isotopes the better known fast breeder reactor makes nuclear from the naturally very abundant not nuclear thermal breeder reactors previously tested using breed the fissile isotope thorium fuel cycle continue studied and while all fission reactors can act all three practice the tasks lead conflicting engineering goals and most reactors have been built with only one the above tasks there are several early such the hanford reactor now power reactors generally convert the kinetic energy fission products into which used heat working fluid and drive heat engine that generates mechanical electrical the working fluid usually water with steam but some designs use other materials such gaseous helium research reactors produce neutrons that are used various with the heat fission being treated unavoidable

scientific work fission chain culminating the trinity test bomb and the little boy and fat man bombs that were exploded over the cities hiroshima and nagasaki japan august even the first fission bombs were thousands times more explosive than comparable mass chemical explosive for little boy weighed total about four tons which was nuclear and was feet long also yielded explosion equivalent about

intended work exploding fission bombs behind massively padded and shielded the strategic importance nuclear weapons major reason why the technology nuclear fission politically viable fission bomb designs arguably within the capabilities many being relatively simple from engineering however the difficulty obtaining fissile nuclear material realize the the key the relative unavailability nuclear weapons all but modern industrialized governments with special programs produce fissile materials see uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel cycle history discovery nuclear fission the discovery nuclear fission occurred following nearly five decades work the science radioactivity and the elaboration new nuclear physics that described the components atoms ernest rutherford proposed model the atom which very dense and positively charged nucleus protons the neutron had not yet been was surrounded negatively charged electrons the rutherford model niels bohr improved upon this reconciling the quantum behavior electrons the bohr model work henri becquerel marie curie pierre curie and rutherford further elaborated that the though tightly could undergo different forms radioactive decay and thereby transmute into other for alpha decay the emission alpha particle two protons and two neutrons bound together into particle identical helium nucleus some work nuclear transmutation had been rutherford was able accomplish transmutation nitrogen into using alpha particles directed nitrogen this was the first observation nuclear reaction that reaction which particles from one decay are used transform another atomic eventually fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved colleagues ernest walton and john cockcroft who used artificially accelerated protons against split this nucleus into two alpha the feat was popularly known splitting the although was not the modern nuclear fission reaction later discovered heavy which discussed meanwhile the possibility combining nuclei nuclear fusion had been studied connection with understanding the processes which power stars the first artificial fusion reaction had been achieved mark oliphant using accelerated deuterium nuclei each consisting single proton bound single create helium after english physicist james chadwick discovered the neutron enrico fermi and his colleagues rome studied the results bombarding uranium with neutrons fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with and protons which the group dubbed ausonium and hesperium however not all were convinced analysis his the german chemist ida noddack notably suggested print that instead creating heavier element that conceivable that the nucleus breaks into several large however noddack conclusion was not pursued the otto hahn fritz strassmann after the fermi otto hahn lise meitner and fritz strassmann began performing similar experiments berlin meitner austrian lost her citizenship with the anschluss the occupation and annexation austria into nazi germany march but she fled july sweden and started correspondence mail with hahn her nephew otto robert frisch also was also sweden when meitner received letter from hahn dated december describing his chemical proof that some the product the bombardment uranium with neutrons was barium hahn suggested bursting the but was unsure what the physical basis for the results barium had atomic mass less than and previously known methods radioactive decay could account for such large difference the mass the frisch was but meitner trusted ability marie curie had been separating barium from radium for many and the techniques were according was said lise hahn was too good chemist for but how could barium formed from larger fragments than protons helium nuclei alpha had ever been chipped away from and chip off large number not nearly enough energy was nor was possible that the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right nucleus was not like brittle solid that can cleaved george gamow had suggested early and bohr had given good arguments that nucleus was much more like liquid perhaps drop could divide itself into two smaller drops more gradual first becoming then and finally being torn rather than broken knew that there were strong forces that would resist such just the surface tension ordinary liquid drop tends resist its division into two smaller but nuclei differed from ordinary drops one important they were electrically and that was known counteract the surface the charge uranium was indeed large enough overcome the effect the surface tension almost the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble very wobbly unstable ready divide itself the slightest such the impact single but there was another after the two drops would driven apart their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence very large about mev where could that energy come lise worked out that the two nuclei formed the division uranium nucleus together would lighter than the original uranium nucleus about fifth the mass now whenever mass disappears energy according einstein formula and fifth proton mass was just equivalent here was the source for that all meitner and frisch had correctly interpreted results mean that the nucleus uranium had split roughly frisch suggested the process named nuclear analogy the process living cell division into two which was then called binary fission just the term nuclear chain would later borrowed from the term fission was borrowed from december hahn and strassmann sent manuscript naturwissenschaften reporting that they had discovered the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons simultaneously they communicated these results meitner she and frisch correctly interpreted the results evidence nuclear frisch confirmed this experimentally january for proving that the barium resulting from his bombardment uranium with neutrons was the product nuclear hahn was awarded the nobel prize for chemistry the sole for his discovery the fission heavy the award was actually given hahn the nobel committee for chemistry decided that none the nominations met the criteria outlined the will alfred such the nobel foundation statutes permit that prize reserved until the following news spread quickly the new which was correctly seen entirely novel physical effect with great and potentially meitner and interpretation the discovery hahn and strassmann crossed the atlantic ocean with niels bohr who was lecture princeton university rabi and willis lamb two columbia university physicists working heard the news and carried back rabi said told enrico fermi fermi gave credit bohr soon thereafter went from princeton columbia see not finding fermi his bohr went down the cyclotron area and found herbert anderson bohr grabbed him the shoulder and young let explain you about something new and exciting was clear number scientists columbia that they should try detect the energy released the nuclear fission uranium from neutron january columbia university team conducted the first nuclear fission experiment the united which was done the basement pupin hall the members the team were herbert anderson eugene booth john dunning enrico fermi norris glasoe and francis slack the experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside ionization chamber and irradiating with and measuring the energy thus the results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that was the isotope uranium particular that was the next the fifth washington conference theoretical physics began washington under the joint auspices the george washington university and the carnegie institution washington there the news nuclear fission was spread even which fostered many more experimental during this period the hungarian physicist szil who was residing the united states the realized that the driven fission heavy atoms could used create nuclear chain reaction such reaction using neutrons was idea had first formulated upon reading disparaging remarks about generating power from his experiment using protons split however szil had not been able achieve driven chain reaction with rich light driven chain reaction the number secondary neutrons produced was greater than then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional producing exponentially increasing number was thus possibility that the fission uranium could yield vast amounts energy for civilian military purposes electric power generation atomic bombs szilard now urged fermi new and ric curie refrain from publishing the possibility chain lest the nazi government become aware the possibilities the eve what would later known world war with some hesitation fermi agreed but curie did and april his team including hans von halban and lew kowarski reported the journal nature that the number neutrons emitted with nuclear fission was then reported per they later corrected this per simultaneous work szilard and walter zinn confirmed these the results suggested the possibility building nuclear reactors first called neutronic szilard and and even nuclear however much was still unknown about fission and chain reaction fission chain reaction realized chicago chain reactions that time were known phenomenon chemistry but the analogous process nuclear using had been foreseen early although that time had idea with what materials the process might szil considered that neutrons would ideal for such since they lacked electrostatic with the news fission neutrons from uranium szil immediately understood the possibility nuclear chain reaction using the fermi and szilard proposed the idea nuclear reactor mediate this the pile would use natural uranium fermi had shown much earlier that neutrons were far more effectively captured atoms they were low energy called slow thermal neutrons because for quantum reasons made the atoms look like much larger targets the thus slow down the secondary neutrons released the fissioning uranium fermi and szilard proposed graphite against which the high energy secondary neutrons would effectively slowing them with enough and with enough their pile could theoretically sustain neutron chain this would result the production well the creation radioactive fission products august szilard and fellow hungarian refugees physicists teller and wigner thought that the germans might make use the fission chain reaction and were spurred attempt attract the attention the united states government the towards they persuaded jewish refugee albert einstein lend his name letter directed president franklin roosevelt the einstein letter suggested the possibility uranium bomb deliverable which would destroy entire harbor and much the surrounding the president received the letter october shortly after world war began but two years before entry into roosevelt ordered that scientific committee authorized for overseeing uranium work and allocated small sum money for pile james chadwick proposed atomic bomb utilizing natural based paper rudolf peierls with the mass needed for critical state being robert oppenheimer thought that cube uranium deuteride side about might blow itself this design was still thought that moderator would need used for nuclear bomb fission this turned out not the case the fissile isotope was werner heisenberg delivered report the german ministry war the possibility uranium most these models were still under the assumption that the bombs would powered slow neutron and thus similar reactor undergoing meltdown england frisch teamed with peierls fellow jewish they had the idea using purified mass the uranium isotope which had cross section just and which was much larger than that natural uranium which the latter assuming that the cross section for neutron fission was the same for slow neutron they determined that pure bomb could have critical mass only instead and that the resulting explosion would the amount actually turned out although several times this amount was used the actual uranium little boy bomb february they delivered the frisch peierls memorandum ironically they were still officially considered enemy the glenn seaborg joseph kennedy arthur wahl and jewish refugee emilio shortly thereafter discovered the decay products produced bombarding with and determined fissile like the possibility isolating was technically because and are chemically and vary their mass only the weight three however sufficient quantity could would allow for fast neutron fission chain this would extremely true atomic the discovery that could produced nuclear reactor pointed towards another approach fast neutron fission both approaches were extremely novel and not yet well and there was considerable scientific skepticism the idea that they could developed short amount june the office scientific research and development was formed the mobilize scientific resources and apply the results research national fermi assembled his first nuclear pile attempt create slow induced chain reaction but the experiment failed achieve due lack proper not enough the proper materials which were producing fission chain reaction natural uranium fuel was found far from early nuclear reactors did not use isotopically enriched and consequence they were required use large quantities highly purified graphite neutron moderation use ordinary water opposed heavy water nuclear reactors requires enriched the partial separation and relative enrichment the rare isotope from the far more common typically reactors also require inclusion extremely chemically pure neutron moderator materials such deuterium heavy water helium beryllium the latter usually graphite the high purity for carbon required because many chemical impurities such the boron component natural boron are very strong neutron absorbers and thus poison the chain reaction and end production such materials industrial scale had solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production the total amount uranium metal produced the usa was not more than few and even this was doubtful metallic beryllium not more than few and concentrated deuterium oxide heavy water not more than few finally carbon had never been produced quantity with anything like the purity required the problem producing large amounts high purity uranium was solved frank spedding using the thermite ames process ames laboratory was established produce the large amounts natural uranium metal that would necessary for the research the critical nuclear reaction success the chicago which used unenriched uranium like all the atomic piles which produced the plutonium for the atomic was also due specifically realization that very pure graphite could used for the moderator even natural uranium piles wartime failure appreciate the qualities very pure graphite led reactor designs dependent heavy which turn was denied the germans allied attacks where heavy water was these among many prevented the nazis from building nuclear reactor capable criticality during the although they never put much effort the united states into nuclear focusing other technologies see german nuclear energy project for more manhattan project and beyond manhattan project the united out effort for making atomic weapons was begun late this work was taken over the army corps engineers and known the manhattan engineer the secret manhattan project was colloquially was led general leslie groves among the dozens sites hanford site washington which had the first scale nuclear reactors oak tennessee which was primarily concerned with uranium enrichment and los alamos new which was the scientific hub for research bomb development and other notably the berkeley radiation laboratory and the metallurgical laboratory the university played important contributing overall scientific direction the project was managed the physicist robert oppenheimer july the first atomic dubbed trinity was detonated the new mexico was fueled plutonium created august two more atomic little boy bomb and fat man plutonium were used against the japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki the years after world war many countries were involved the further development nuclear fission for the purposes nuclear reactors and nuclear the opened the first commercial nuclear power plant there are reactors countries natural fission reactors earth criticality nature three ore deposits oklo gabon sixteen sites the called oklo fossil reactors have been discovered which sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately billion years unknown until but postulated paul kuroda when french physicist francis perrin discovered the oklo fossil reactors was realized that nature had beaten humans the large scale natural uranium fission chain moderated normal had occurred far the past and would not possible this ancient process was able use normal water moderator only because
