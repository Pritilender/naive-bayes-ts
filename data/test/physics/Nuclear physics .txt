bragg bardeen shockley chadwick lawrence zeilinger the history nuclear physics discipline distinct from atomic physics starts with the discovery radioactivity henri becquerel while investigating phosphorescence uranium salts the discovery the electron thomson year later was indication that the atom had internal the turn the century the accepted model the atom was thomson plum pudding model which the atom was large positively charged ball with small negatively charged electrons embedded inside the turn the century physicists had also discovered three types radiation emanating from which they named alpha beta and gamma radiation experiments otto hahn and james chadwick discovered that the beta decay spectrum was continuous rather than that electrons were ejected from the atom with range rather than the discrete amounts energies that were observed gamma and alpha this was problem for nuclear physics the because indicated that energy was not conserved these albert einstein formulated the idea mass energy equivalence while the work radioactivity becquerel and marie curie predates explanation the source the energy radioactivity would have wait for the discovery that the nucleus itself was composed smaller the nucleons rutherford team discovers the nucleus ernest rutherford ernest rutherford published radiation the particle from radium passing through hans geiger expanded this work communication the royal society with experiments and rutherford had passing particles through aluminum foil and gold more work was published geiger and marsden and further greatly expanded work was published rutherford went before the royal society explain the experiments and propound the new theory the atomic nucleus now understand the key experiment behind this announcement happened the university manchester ernest team performed remarkable experiment which hans geiger and ernest marsden under his supervision fired alpha particles helium thin film gold foil the plum pudding model predicted that the alpha particles should come out the foil with their trajectories being most slightly rutherford had the idea instruct his team look for something that shocked him actually few particles were scattered through large even completely some likened firing bullet tissue paper and having bounce the beginning with analysis the data eventually led the rutherford model the which the atom has very very dense nucleus containing most its and consisting heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons order balance out the charge since the neutron was this model which not the modern nitrogen consisted nucleus with protons and electrons total and the nucleus was surrounded more orbiting the rutherford model worked quite well until studies nuclear spin were carried out franco rasetti the california institute technology was known that protons and electrons had spin and the rutherford model the total nuclear particles should have paired cancel each and the final odd particle should have left the nucleus with net spin rasetti however that had spin james chadwick discovers the neutron chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed walther bothe herbert becker and ric curie was actually due neutral particle about the same mass the that called the neutron following suggestion about the need for such the same year dmitri ivanenko suggested that neutrons were fact spin particles and that the nucleus contained neutrons explain the mass not due and that there were electrons the only protons and the neutron spin immediately solved the problem the spin the one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron this each contribute spin the same for final total spin with the discovery the scientists last could calculate what fraction binding energy each nucleus from comparing the nuclear mass with that the protons and neutrons which composed differences between nuclear masses were calculated this way when nuclear reactions were were found agree with calculation the equivalence mass and energy high accuracy within percent proca equations the massive vector boson field alexandru proca was the first develop and report the massive vector boson field equations and theory the mesonic field nuclear forces proca equations were known wolfgang pauli who mentioned the equations his nobel and they were also known wentzel taketani sakata kemmer heitler and hlich who appreciated the content equations for developing theory the atomic nuclei nuclear yukawa meson postulated bind nuclei hideki yukawa proposed the first significant theory the strong force explain how the nucleus holds the yukawa interaction virtual particle later called meson mediated force between all including protons and this force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence proton and also gave explanation why the attractive strong force had more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between later the discovery the meson showed have the properties with the modern model the atom was the center the atom contains tight ball neutrons and which held together the strong nuclear unless too unstable nuclei may undergo alpha which they emit energetic helium beta which they eject electron positron after one these decays the resultant nucleus may left excited and this case decays its ground state emitting high energy photons gamma the study the strong and weak nuclear forces the latter explained enrico fermi via fermi interaction led physicists collide nuclei and electrons ever higher this research became the science particle physics the crown jewel which the standard model particle physics which describes the weak and electromagnetic modern nuclear physics liquid drop model nuclear shell model heavy nucleus can contain hundreds nucleons which means that with some approximation can treated classical system rather than quantum mechanical one the resulting liquid drop model the nucleus has energy which arises partly from surface tension and partly from electrical repulsion the the drop model able reproduce many features including the general trend binding energy with respect mass well the phenomenon nuclear fission superimposed this classical however are mechanical which can described using the nuclear shell model developed large part maria mayer nuclei with certain numbers neutrons and protons the magic numbers are particularly because their shells are other more complicated models for the nucleus have also been such the interacting boson model which pairs neutrons and protons interact analogously cooper pairs much current research nuclear physics relates the study nuclei under extreme conditions such high spin and excitation nuclei may also have extreme shapes similar that rugby balls even pears extreme proton experimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion nucleon transfer employing ion beams from accelerator beams with even higher energies can used create nuclei very high and there are signs that these experiments have produced phase transition from normal nuclear matter new the quark gluon plasma which the quarks mingle with one rather than being segregated triplets they are neutrons and nuclear decay radioactivity eighty elements have least one stable isotope never observed amounting total about stable however thousands isotopes have been characterized that are these radioisotopes decay over time scales ranging from fractions second years billions even trillions the stability nucleus highest when falls into certain range balance composition neutrons and too few too many neutrons may cause for beta decay nitrogen atom protons neutrons converted oxygen atom protons neutrons within few seconds being this decay neutron the nitrogen nucleus converted into proton and electron and antineutrino the weak interaction the element transmuted another element acquiring the created alpha decay the radioactive element decays emitting helium nucleus protons and neutrons giving another plus many cases this process continues through several steps this including other types until stable element gamma decay nucleus decays from excited state into lower energy emitting gamma ray the element not changed another element the process nuclear transmutation other more exotic decays are possible see the main for internal conversion decay the energy from excited nucleus may used eject one the inner orbital electrons from the process which produces high speed but not beta decay and unlike beta does not transmute one element nuclear fusion nuclear fusion two low mass nuclei come into very close contact with each that the strong force fuses requires large amount energy overcome the repulsion between the nuclei for the strong nuclear forces produce this therefore nuclear fusion can only take place very high temperatures high once the process very large amount energy released and the combined nucleus assumes lower energy the binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number until nickel stars like the sun are powered the fusion four protons into helium two positrons and two neutrinos the uncontrolled fusion hydrogen into helium known thermonuclear frontier current research various for example the joint european torus and iter the development economically viable method using energy from controlled fusion natural nuclear fusion the origin the light and energy produced the core all stars including our own nuclear fission nuclear fission the reverse process for nuclei heavier than the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass therefore possible for energy released heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter the process alpha decay essence special type spontaneous nuclear fission this process produces highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make the alpha particle are especially tightly bound each making production this nucleus fission particularly for certain the heaviest nuclei which produce neutrons and which also easily absorb neutrons initiate igniting type initiated fission can called chain reaction chain reactions were known chemistry before and fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain the fission nuclear chain reaction using produced the source energy for nuclear power plants and fission type nuclear such those detonated the united states hiroshima and nagasaki japan the end world war heavy nuclei such uranium and thorium may also undergo spontaneous fission but they are much more likely undergo decay alpha for initiated reaction there must critical mass the element present certain space under certain the conditions for the smallest critical mass require the conservation the emitted neutrons and also their slowing moderation there greater cross section probability them initiating another two regions oklo gabon africa natural nuclear fission reactors were active over billion years measurements natural neutrino emission have demonstrated that around half the heat emanating from the core results from radioactive however not known any this results from fission citation needed production heavy elements atomic number greater than nucleosynthesis according the the universe cooled after the big bang eventually became possible for common subatomic particles know them protons and the most common particles created the big bang which are still easily observable today were protons and electrons equal the protons would eventually form hydrogen almost all the neutrons created the big bang were absorbed into helium the first three minutes after the big and this helium accounts for most the helium the universe today see big bang nucleosynthesis some fraction elements beyond helium were created the big the protons and neutrons collided with each other beryllium and perhaps some but all the heavier element number and elements greater atomic number that see were created inside stars during series fusion such the proton proton chain the cno cycle and the triple alpha process progressively heavier elements are created during the evolution since the binding energy per nucleon peaks around energy only released fusion processes occurring below this since the creation heavier nuclei fusion costs nature resorts the process neutron neutrons due their lack are readily absorbed the heavy elements are created either slow neutron capture process the called process the rapid process the process occurs thermally pulsing stars called asymptotic giant branch and takes hundreds thousands years reach the heaviest elements lead and the process thought occur supernova explosions because the conditions high high neutron flux and ejected matter are these stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very involving very rich species which then decay heavier especially the called waiting points that correspond more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells magic see
