external links history history optics timeline electromagnetism and classical optics optics began with the development lenses the ancient egyptians and mesopotamians the earliest known made from polished often quartz date from early for assyrian lenses such the nimrud lens the ancient romans and greeks filled glass spheres with water make these practical developments were followed the development theories light and vision ancient greek and indian philosophers and the development geometrical optics the greco roman world the word optics comes from the ancient greek word meaning look greek philosophy optics broke down into two opposing theories how vision the intromission theory and the emission the mission approach saw vision coming from objects casting off copies themselves called that were captured the with many propagators including democritus epicurus aristotle and their this theory seems have some contact with modern theories what vision really but remained only speculation lacking any experimental plato first articulated the emission the idea that visual perception accomplished rays emitted the also commented the parity reversal mirrors timaeus some hundred years euclid wrote treatise entitled optics where linked vision geometry creating geometrical optics based his work emission theory wherein described the mathematical rules perspective and described the effects refraction qualitatively although questioned that beam light from the eye could instantaneously light the stars every time someone ptolemy his treatise optics held intromission theory the rays from the eye formed the vertex being within the and the base defining the visual the rays were and conveyed information back the intellect about the distance and orientation summarised much euclid and went describe way measure the angle refraction though failed notice the empirical relationship between and the angle ibn sahl law during the middle ages greek ideas about optics were resurrected and extended writers the muslim world one the earliest these was kindi who wrote the merits aristotelian and euclidean ideas favouring the emission theory since could better quantify optical the persian mathematician ibn sahl wrote the treatise burning mirrors and correctly describing law refraction equivalent snell law used this law compute optimum shapes for lenses and curved mirrors the early alhazen ibn wrote the book optics kitab manazir which explored reflection and refraction and proposed new system for explaining vision and light based observation and rejected the emission ptolemaic optics with its rays being emitted the and instead put forward the idea that light reflected all directions straight lines from all points the objects being viewed and then entered the although was unable correctly explain how the eye captured the alhazen work was largely ignored the arabic world but was anonymously translated into latin around and further summarised and expanded the polish monk witelo making standard text optics europe for the next years the century medieval europe the english bishop robert grosseteste wrote wide range scientific topics discussing light from four different epistemology metaphysics cosmogony etiology physics and theology basing the works aristotle and grosseteste most famous roger bacon wrote works citing wide range recently translated optical and philosophical including those alhazen aristotle avicenna averroes euclid ptolemy tideus and constantine the african bacon was able use parts glass spheres magnifying glasses demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from the first wearable eyeglasses were invented italy around this was the start the optical industry grinding and polishing lenses for these spectacles first venice and florence the thirteenth and later the spectacle making centres both the netherlands and spectacle makers created improved types lenses for the correction vision based more empirical knowledge gained from observing the effects the lenses rather than using the rudimentary optical theory the day theory which for the most part could not even adequately explain how spectacles this practical mastery and experimentation with lenses led directly the invention the compound optical microscope around and the refracting telescope both which appeared the spectacle making centres the netherlands the early century johannes kepler expanded geometric optics his covering reflection flat and curved the principles pinhole cameras inverse square law governing the intensity and the optical explanations astronomical phenomena such lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax was also able correctly deduce the role the retina the actual organ that recorded finally being able scientifically quantify the effects different types lenses that spectacle makers had been observing over the previous years after the invention the telescope kepler set out the theoretical basis how they worked and described improved known the keplerian telescope using two convex lenses produce higher opticks optical theory progressed the century with treatises written philosopher ren descartes which explained variety optical phenomena including reflection and refraction assuming that light was emitted objects which produced this differed substantively from the ancient greek emission the late and early newton expanded ideas into corpuscle theory light famously determining that white light was mix colours which can separated into its component parts with prism christiaan huygens proposed wave theory for light based suggestions that had been made robert hooke hooke himself publicly criticised theories light and the feud between the two lasted until newton published opticks and the partly because his success other areas physics was generally considered the victor the debate over the nature newtonian optics was generally accepted until the early century when thomas young and augustin jean fresnel conducted experiments the interference light that firmly established wave young famous double slit experiment showed that light followed the law superposition which like property not predicted corpuscle this work led theory diffraction for light and opened entire area study physical wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory james clerk maxwell the the next development optical theory came when max planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation assuming that the exchange energy between light and matter only occurred discrete amounts called quanta albert einstein published the theory the photoelectric effect that firmly established the quantization light niels bohr showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts thus explaining the discrete lines seen emission and absorption spectra the understanding the interaction between light and matter which followed from these developments not only formed the basis quantum optics but also was crucial for the development quantum mechanics the ultimate the theory quantum electrodynamics explains all optics and electromagnetic processes general the result the exchange real and virtual photons quantum optics gained practical importance with the inventions the maser and the laser following the work paul dirac quantum field theory george sudarshan roy glauber and leonard mandel applied quantum theory the electromagnetic field the and gain more detailed understanding photodetection and the statistics classical optics classical optics divided into two main geometrical optics and physical ray light considered travel straight and wave light considered electromagnetic geometrical optics can viewed approximation physical optics which can applied when the wavelength the light used much smaller than the size the optical elements system being geometrical optics geometrical optics geometrical optics ray optics describes the propagation light terms rays which travel straight and whose paths are governed the laws reflection and refraction interfaces between different these laws were discovered empirically far back and have been used the design optical components and instruments from then until the present they can summarised when ray light hits the boundary between two transparent divided into reflected and refracted where constant for any two materials and given colour known the refractive index the laws reflection and refraction can derived from fermat principle which states that the path taken between two points ray light the path that can traversed the least approximations geometric optics often simplified making the paraxial approximation small angle the mathematical behaviour then becomes allowing optical components and systems described simple this leads the techniques gaussian optics and paraxial ray tracing which are used find basic properties optical such approximate image and object positions and magnifications reflections reflection reflections can divided into two specular reflection and diffuse reflection specular reflection describes the gloss surfaces such which reflect light predictable this allows for production reflected images that can associated with actual real extrapolated virtual location diffuse reflection describes non limpid such paper the reflections from these surfaces can only described with the exact distribution the reflected light depending the microscopic structure the many diffuse reflectors are described can approximated lambert cosine law which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse specular the direction the reflected ray determined the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal line perpendicular the surface the point where the ray the incident and reflected rays and the normal lie single and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal the same that between the incident ray and the this known the law reflection for flat mirrors the law reflection implies that images objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror the objects are front the the image size the same the object the law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted which perceive right images formed from reflection two any even number mirrors are not parity corner reflectors retroreflect light producing reflected rays that travel back the direction from which the incident rays mirrors with curved surfaces can modelled ray tracing and using the law reflection each point the for mirrors with parabolic surfaces parallel rays incident the mirror produce reflected rays that converge common focus other curved surfaces may also focus but with aberrations due the diverging shape causing the focus smeared out spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration curved mirrors can form images with magnification greater than less than and the magnification can indicating that the image upright image formed reflection mirror always while inverted image real and can projected onto refractions refraction refraction occurs when light travels through area space that has changing index this principle allows for lenses and the focusing the simplest case refraction occurs when there interface between uniform medium with index refraction and another medium with index refraction such snell law describes the resulting deflection the light where and are the angles between the normal the and the incident and refracted respectively this phenomenon also associated with changing speed light seen from the definition index refraction provided above which where and are the wave velocities through the respective various consequences law include the fact that for light rays travelling from material with high index refraction material with low index possible for the interaction with the interface result zero this phenomenon called total internal reflection and allows for fibre optics technology light signals travel down fibre optic undergoes total internal reflection allowing for essentially light lost over the length the also possible produce polarised light rays using combination reflection and when refracted ray and the reflected ray form right angle the reflected ray has the property plane the angle incidence required for such scenario known snell law can used predict the deflection light rays they pass through linear long the indexes refraction and the geometry the media are for the propagation light through prism results the light ray being deflected depending the shape and orientation the additionally since different frequencies light have slightly different indexes refraction most refraction can used produce dispersion spectra that appear the discovery this phenomenon when passing light through prism famously attributed isaac some media have index refraction which varies gradually with position thus light rays curve through the medium rather than travel straight this effect what responsible for mirages seen hot days where the changing index refraction the air causes the light rays bend creating the appearance specular reflections the distance the surface pool material that has varying index refraction called index material and has many useful properties used modern optical scanning technologies including photocopiers and scanners the phenomenon studied the field gradient index optics device which produces converging diverging light rays due refraction known thin lenses produce focal points either side that can modelled using the lensmaker equation two types lenses convex lenses which cause parallel light rays and concave lenses which cause parallel light rays the detailed prediction how images are produced these lenses can made using tracing similar curved similarly curved thin lenses follow simple equation that determines the location the images given particular focal length and object distance where the distance associated with the image and considered convention negative the same side the lens the object and positive the opposite side the the focal length considered negative for concave incoming parallel rays are focused convex lens into inverted real image one focal length from the the far side the rays from object finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal the closer the object the the further the image from the with concave incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the such way that they seem have originated upright virtual image one focal length from the the same side the lens that the parallel rays are approaching rays from object finite distance are associated with virtual image that closer the lens than the focal and the same side the lens the the closer the object the the closer the virtual image the likewise the magnification lens given where the negative sign indicate upright object for positive values and inverted object for negative similar upright images produced single lenses are virtual while inverted images are lenses suffer from aberrations that distort images and focal these are due both geometrical imperfections and due the changing index refraction for different wavelengths light chromatic aberration physical optics physical optics physical light considered propagate wave this model predicts phenomena such interference and diffraction which are not explained geometric the speed light waves air approximately exactly vacuum the wavelength visible light waves varies between and but the term light also often applied infrared and ultraviolet radiation the wave model can used make predictions about how optical system will behave without requiring explanation what waving what until the middle the most physicists believed ethereal medium which the light disturbance the existence electromagnetic waves was predicted maxwell equations these waves propagate the speed light and have varying electric and magnetic fields which are orthogonal one and also the direction propagation the light waves are now generally treated electromagnetic waves except when quantum mechanical effects have modelling and design optical systems using physical optics many simplified approximations are available for analysing and designing optical most these use single scalar quantity represent the electric field the light rather than using vector model with orthogonal electric and magnetic the huygens fresnel equation one such this was derived empirically fresnel based hypothesis that each point wavefront generates secondary spherical which fresnel combined with the principle superposition the kirchhoff diffraction equation which derived using puts the fresnel equation firmer physical examples the application fresnel principle can found the sections diffraction and fraunhofer diffraction more rigorous involving the modelling both electric and magnetic fields the light are required when dealing with the detailed interaction light with materials where the interaction depends their electric and magnetic for the behaviour light wave interacting with metal surface quite different from what happens when interacts with dielectric vector model must also used model polarised numerical modeling techniques such the finite element method the boundary element method and the transmission line matrix method can used model the propagation light systems which cannot solved such models are computationally demanding and are normally only used solve scale problems that require accuracy beyond that which can achieved with analytical all the results from geometrical optics can recovered using the techniques fourier optics which apply many the same mathematical and analytical techniques used acoustic engineering and signal processing gaussian beam propagation simple paraxial physical optics model for the propagation coherent radiation such laser this technique partially accounts for allowing accurate calculations the rate which laser beam expands with and the minimum size which the beam can gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between geometric and physical superposition and interference superposition principle interference the absence nonlinear effects the superposition principle can used predict the shape interacting waveforms through the simple addition the this interaction waves produce resulting pattern generally termed interference and can result variety two waves the same wavelength and frequency are phase both the wave crests and wave troughs this results constructive interference and increase the amplitude the which for light associated with brightening the waveform that alternatively the two waves the same wavelength and frequency are out then the wave crests will align with wave troughs and this results destructive interference and decrease the amplitude the which for light associated with dimming the waveform that see below for illustration this combined waveform wave wave two waves phase two waves out phase since the huygens fresnel principle states that every point wavefront associated with the production new possible for wavefront interfere with itself constructively destructively different locations producing bright and dark fringes regular and predictable interferometry the science measuring these usually means making precise determinations distances angular resolutions the michelson interferometer was famous instrument which used interference effects accurately measure the speed the appearance thin films and coatings directly affected interference antireflective coatings use destructive interference reduce the reflectivity the surfaces they and can used minimise glare and unwanted the simplest case single layer with thickness fourth the wavelength incident the reflected wave from the top the film and the reflected wave from the material interface are then exactly out causing destructive the waves are only exactly out phase for one which would typically chosen near the centre the visible around more complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over broad extremely low reflectivity single constructive interference thin films can create strong reflection light range which can narrow broad depending the design the these films are used make dielectric mirrors interference filters heat reflectors and filters for colour separation colour television cameras this interference effect also what causes the colourful rainbow patterns seen oil diffraction and optical resolution diffraction optical resolution diffraction the process which light interference most commonly the effect was first described francesco maria grimaldi who also coined the term from the latin diffringere break into later that robert hooke and isaac newton also described phenomena now known diffraction newton rings while james gregory recorded his observations diffraction patterns from bird the first physical optics model diffraction that relied the huygens fresnel principle was developed thomas young his interference experiments with the interference patterns two closely spaced young showed that his results could only explained the two slits acted two unique sources waves rather than and augustin jean fresnel firmly established the mathematics how wave interference can account for the simplest physical models diffraction use equations that describe the angular separation light and dark fringes due light particular wavelength the equation takes the form where the separation between two wavefront sources the case was two slits the angular separation between the central fringe and the order where the central maximum this equation modified slightly take into account variety situations such diffraction through single diffraction through multiple diffraction through diffraction grating that contains large number slits equal more complicated models diffraction require working with the mathematics fresnel fraunhofer diffraction ray diffraction makes use the fact that atoms crystal have regular spacing distances that are the order one angstrom see diffraction rays with similar wavelengths that spacing are passed through the since crystals are dimensional objects rather than dimensional the associated diffraction pattern varies two directions according bragg reflection with the associated bright spots occurring unique patterns and being twice the spacing between diffraction effects limit the ability for optical detector optically resolve separate light light that passing through aperture will experience diffraction and the best images that can created described diffraction limited optics appear central spot with surrounding bright separated dark this pattern known airy pattern and the central bright lobe airy disk the size such disk given where the angular the wavelength the and the diameter the lens the angular separation the two points significantly less than the airy disk angular then the two points cannot resolved the but their angular separation much greater than distinct images the two points are formed and they can therefore rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary rayleigh criterion that two points whose angular separation equal the airy disk radius measured first that the first place where light can considered can seen that the greater the diameter the lens its the finer the interferometry with its ability mimic extremely large baseline allows for the greatest angular resolution for astronomical the atmosphere prevents optimal resolution from being achieved the visible spectrum due the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which cause stars twinkle astronomers refer this effect the quality astronomical seeing techniques known adaptive optics have been used eliminate the atmospheric disruption images and achieve results that approach the diffraction dispersion and scattering dispersion scattering refractive processes take place the physical optics where the wavelength light similar other kind the simplest type scattering thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected single the limit thompson which the wavelike nature light light dispersed independent the contrast compton scattering which dependent and strictly quantum mechanical process involving the nature light statistical elastic scattering light numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength the light process known rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering particles that are similar larger wavelength known mie scattering with the tyndall effect being commonly observed small proportion light scattering from atoms molecules may undergo raman scattering wherein the frequency changes due excitation the atoms and brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency light changes due local changes with time and movements dense dispersion occurs when different frequencies light have different phase velocities due either material properties material dispersion the geometry optical waveguide waveguide dispersion the most familiar form dispersion decrease index refraction with increasing which seen most transparent this called normal occurs all dielectric materials wavelength ranges where the material does not absorb wavelength ranges where medium has significant the index refraction can increase with this called anomalous the separation colours prism example normal the surfaces the snell law predicts that light incident angle the normal will refracted angle sin thus blue with its higher refractive bent more strongly than red resulting the known rainbow pattern phase velocity group velocity material

dispersion cause changes the group characteristics the the features the wave packet that change with the same frequency the amplitude the electromagnetic group velocity manifests out the signal envelope the radiation and can quantified with group dispersion delay where the group velocity for uniform the group velocity where the index refraction and the speed light this gives simpler form for the dispersion delay less than the medium said have positive dispersion normal greater than the medium has negative dispersion light pulse propagated through normally dispersive the result the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency the pulse therefore becomes positively chirped chirped increasing frequency with this causes the spectrum coming out prism appear with red light the least refracted and violet light the most conversely pulse travels through anomalously dispersive high frequency components travel faster than the lower and the pulse becomes negatively chirped down chirped decreasing frequency with the result group velocity whether negative ultimately temporal spreading the this makes dispersion management extremely important optical communications systems based optical fibres since dispersion too group pulses representing information will each spread time and making impossible extract the polarization polarization polarization general property

single line the this special case called linear polarization the direction this line depends the relative amplitudes the two the middle the two orthogonal components have the same amplitudes and are out this one component zero when the other component maximum minimum there are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this the component can ahead the component can behind the component this special the electric vector traces out circle the this polarization called circular the rotation direction the circle depends which the two phase relationships exists and corresponds right hand circular polarization and left hand circular polarization all other where the two components either not have the same amplitudes their phase difference neither zero nor multiple the polarization called elliptical polarization because the electric vector traces out ellipse the plane the polarization ellipse this shown the above figure the detailed mathematics polarization done using jones calculus and characterised the stokes parameters changing polarization media that have different indexes refraction for different polarization modes are called birefringent well known manifestations

different propagation due refraction for this the case with macroscopic crystals calcite which present the viewer with two orthogonally polarised images whatever viewed through was this effect that provided the first discovery erasmus bartholinus the phase and thus the change polarization usually frequency which combination with dichroism often gives rise bright colours and like mineralogy such known pleochroism are frequently exploited for the purpose identifying minerals using polarization microscopes additionally many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become when subject mechanical stress phenomenon which the basis photoelasticity non birefringent rotate the linear polarization light include the use prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection prism set designed for efficient collinear media that reduce the amplitude certain polarization modes are called dichroic with devices that block nearly all the radiation one mode known polarizing filters simply polarisers malus law which named after louis malus says that when perfect polariser placed linear polarised beam the the light that passes through given where beam unpolarised light can thought containing uniform mixture linear polarizations all possible since the average value the transmission coefficient becomes some light lost the polariser and the actual transmission unpolarised light will somewhat lower than around for type polarisers but considerably higher for some birefringent prism addition birefringence and dichroism extended polarization effects can also occur the interface between two materials different refractive these effects are treated the fresnel equations part the wave transmitted and part with the ratio depending angle incidence and the angle this physical optics recovers brewster angle when light reflects from thin film interference between the reflections from the surfaces can produce polarization the reflected and transmitted natural light polarising filter most sources electromagnetic radiation contain large number atoms molecules that emit the orientation the electric fields produced these emitters may not correlated which case the light said unpolarised there partial correlation between the the light partially polarised the polarization consistent across the spectrum the partially polarised light can described superposition completely unpolarised and completely polarised one may then describe the light terms the degree polarization and the parameters the polarization light reflected shiny transparent materials partly fully except when the light normal the was this effect that allowed the mathematician louis malus make the measurements that allowed for his development the first mathematical models for polarised

optics are integral the functioning many consumer goods including cameras rainbows and mirages are examples optical optical communication provides the backbone for both the internet and modern telephony human eye ciliary muscle pupil cornea lens cortex optic nerve fovea retina human eye photometry the human eye functions focusing light onto layer photoreceptor cells called the retina which forms the inner lining the back the the focusing accomplished series transparent light entering the eye passes first through the cornea which provides much the optical the light then continues through the fluid just behind the the anterior chamber then passes through the pupil the light then passes through the lens which focuses the light further and allows adjustment the light then passes through the main body fluid the the vitreous humour and reaches the the cells the retina line the back the except for where the optic nerve exits this results blind spot there are two types photoreceptor rods and which are sensitive different aspects rod cells are sensitive the intensity light over wide frequency thus are responsible for black white vision rod cells are not present the fovea the area the retina responsible for central and are not responsive cone cells spatial and temporal changes there however twenty times more rod cells than cone cells the retina because the rod cells are present across wider because their wider rods are responsible for peripheral vision cone cells are less sensitive the overall intensity but come three varieties that are sensitive different ranges and thus are used the perception colour and photopic vision cone cells are highly concentrated the fovea and have high visual acuity meaning that they are better spatial resolution than rod since cone cells are not sensitive dim light rod most night vision limited rod likewise since cone cells are the central vision including the vision needed most fine detail work such careful examination done cone ciliary muscles around the lens allow the focus this process known accommodation the near point and far point define the nearest and farthest distances from the eye which object can brought into sharp for person with normal the far point located the near location depends how much the muscles can increase the curvature the and how inflexible the lens has become with optometrists ophthalmologists and opticians usually consider appropriate near point closer than normal reading approximately defects vision can explained using optical people the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the condition known presbyopia similarly people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length their lens enough allow for nearby objects imaged their conversely people who cannot increase the focal length their lens enough allow for distant objects imaged the retina suffer from myopia and have far point that considerably closer than condition known astigmatism results when the cornea not spherical but instead more curved one this causes horizontally extended objects focused different parts the retina than vertically extended and results distorted all these conditions can corrected using corrective lenses for presbyopia and converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary bring the near point closer the eye while for myopia diverging lens provides the curvature necessary send the far point astigmatism corrected with cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly one direction than compensating for the uniformity the the optical power corrective lenses measured diopters value equal the reciprocal the focal length measured with positive focal length corresponding converging lens and negative focal length corresponding diverging for lenses that correct for astigmatism three numbers are one for the spherical one for the cylindrical and one for the angle orientation the visual effects optical illusions perspective visual effects optical illusions also called visual are characterized visually perceived images that differ from objective the information gathered the eye processed the brain give percept that differs from the object being optical illusions can the result variety phenomena including physical effects that create images that are different from the objects that make the physiological effects the eyes and brain excessive stimulation brightness tilt colour movement and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences cognitive illusions include some which result from the unconscious misapplication certain optical for the ames room hering lyer orbison ponzo sander and wundt illusions all rely the suggestion the appearance distance using converging and diverging the same way that parallel light rays indeed any set parallel appear converge vanishing point infinity dimensionally rendered images with artistic perspective this suggestion also responsible for the famous moon illusion where the despite having essentially the same angular appears much larger near the horizon than does zenith this illusion confounded ptolemy that incorrectly attributed atmospheric refraction when described his optics another type optical illusion exploits broken patterns trick the mind into perceiving symmetries asymmetries that are not examples include the caf wall ehrenstein fraser spiral poggendorff and llner illusions related but not strictly are patterns that occur due the superimposition periodic for example transparent tissues with grid structure produce shapes known moir patterns while the superimposition periodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines curves produces line patterns optical instruments cyclopaedia optical instruments single lenses have variety applications including photographic lenses corrective and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used parabolic reflectors and rear view mirrors combining number prisms and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical for periscope simply two plane mirrors aligned allow for viewing around the most famous compound optical instruments science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented the dutch the late microscopes were first developed with just two objective lens and eyepiece the objective lens essentially magnifying glass and was designed with very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has longer focal this has the effect producing magnified images close generally additional source illumination used since magnified images are dimmer due the conservation energy and the spreading light rays over larger surface modern known compound microscopes have many lenses them typically optimize the functionality and enhance image slightly different variety the comparison microscope looks side images produce stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used the first called refracting telescopes were also developed with single objective and eyepiece contrast the the objective lens the telescope was designed with large focal length avoid optical the objective focuses image distant object its focal point which adjusted the focal point eyepiece much smaller focal the main goal telescope not necessarily but rather collection light which determined the physical size the objective thus telescopes are normally indicated the diameters their objectives rather than the magnification which can changed switching because the magnification telescope equal the focal length the objective divided the focal length the smaller length eyepieces cause greater since crafting large lenses much more difficult than crafting large most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes that telescopes that use primary mirror rather than objective the same general optical considerations apply reflecting telescopes that applied refracting namely the larger the primary the more light and the magnification still equal the focal length the primary mirror divided the focal length the professional telescopes generally not have eyepieces and instead place instrument often coupled the focal point photography science photography the optics photography involves both lenses and the medium which the electromagnetic radiation whether plate film charge coupled device photographers must consider the reciprocity the camera and the shot which summarized the relation other the smaller the aperture giving greater depth the less light coming the length time has increased leading possible blurriness motion example the use the law reciprocity the sunny rule which gives rough estimate for the settings needed estimate the proper exposure aperture measured unitless number called the number often notated and given where the focal length and the diameter the entrance treated single and specific values are written replacing the number sign with the the two ways increase the stop are either decrease the diameter the entrance pupil change longer focal length the case zoom lens this can done simply adjusting the higher numbers also have larger depth field due the lens approaching the limit pinhole camera which able focus all images regardless but requires very long exposure the field view that the lens will provide changes with the focal length the there are three basic classifications based the relationship the diagonal size the film sensor size the camera the focal length the normal lens angle view about called normal because this angle considered roughly equivalent human vision and focal length approximately equal the diagonal the film wide angle lens angle view wider than and focal length shorter than normal long focus lens angle view narrower than normal this any lens with focal length longer than the diagonal measure the film the most common type long focus lens the telephoto lens design that uses special telephoto group physically shorter than its focal modern zoom lenses may have some all these the absolute value for the exposure time required depends how sensitive light the medium being used measured the film speed for digital the quantum efficiency early photography used media that had very low light and exposure times had long even for very bright technology has has the sensitivity through film cameras and digital other results from physical and geometrical optics apply camera for the maximum resolution capability particular camera determined the diffraction limit associated with the pupil size and roughly the rayleigh atmospheric optics
