parity photon elementary particle the quantum light and all other forms electromagnetic radiation and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force even when static via virtual photons the effects this force are easily observable both the microscopic and macroscopic level because the photon has zero rest mass this allows long distance interactions like all elementary photons are currently best explained quantum mechanics and exhibit wave particle duality exhibiting properties both waves and particles for single photon may refracted lens exhibit wave interference with but also act particle giving definite result when its position the modern photon concept was developed gradually albert einstein explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model the photon model accounted for the frequency dependence and explained the ability matter and radiation thermal equilibrium also accounted for anomalous including the properties black body radiation that other most notably max planck had sought explain using semiclassical models which light still described maxwell equations but the material objects that emit and absorb light amounts energy that are quantized they change energy only certain particular discrete amounts and cannot change energy any arbitrary although these semiclassical models contributed the development quantum many further experiments starting with compton scattering single photons first observed validated hypothesis that light itself quantized the optical physicist frithiof wolfers and the chemist gilbert lewis coined the name photon for these and after when arthur compton won the nobel prize for his scattering most scientists accepted the validity that quanta light have independent and the term photon for light quanta was

brout hagen guralnik kibble ting richter max planck was working body radiation and suggested that the energy electromagnetic waves could only released packets his article annalen der physik called these packets energy the word quanta singular quantum was used even before mean particles amounts different quantities including electricity later albert einstein went further suggesting that electromagnetic waves could only exist these discrete called such wave packet the light quantum das lichtquant note the name photon derives from the greek word for transliterated arthur compton used photon referring gilbert lewis the same name was used the american physicist and psychologist leonard troland who coined the word the irish physicist john joly and the french physiologist ren wurmser and the french physicist frithiof wolfers the name was suggested initially unit related the illumination the eye and the resulting sensation light and was used later physiological although and theories were never they were contradicted many the new name was adopted very soon most physicists after compton used note photon usually denoted the symbol the greek letter gamma this symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays which were discovered paul villard named ernest rutherford and shown form electromagnetic radiation rutherford and edward andrade chemistry and optical engineering photons are usually symbolized the energy where planck constant and the greek letter the frequency much less the photon can symbolized where its frequency denoted physical properties special relativity photonic molecule photon massless note has electric charge and stable photon has two possible polarization states the momentum representation which preferred quantum field photon described its wave vector which determines its wavelength and its direction wave vector may not zero and can represented either spatial vector four vector the latter case belongs the light cone different signs the vector denote different circular polarizations but the vector representation one should account for the polarization state actually spin quantum number both cases the space possible wave vectors the photon the gauge boson for electromagnetism and therefore all other quantum numbers the photon such lepton number baryon number and flavour quantum numbers are photons are emitted many natural for when charge accelerated emits synchrotron radiation during molecular atomic nuclear transition lower energy level photons various energy will from radio waves gamma rays photon can also emitted when particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated for electron positron annihilation empty the photon moves the speed light and its energy and momentum are related where the magnitude the momentum vector this derives from the following relativistic with the energy and momentum photon depend only its frequency its wavelength where the wave vector where the wave number the angular frequency and the reduced planck constant since points the direction the the magnitude the momentum the photon also carries spin angular momentum that does not depend its the magnitude its spin and the component measured along its direction its helicity must these two possible called handed and correspond the two possible circular polarization states the illustrate the significance these the annihilation particle with its antiparticle free space must result the creation least two photons for the following the center mass frame the colliding antiparticles have net whereas single photon always has momentum since have only the frequency which cannot hence conservation momentum translational invariance requires that least two photons are with zero net possible the system interacts with another particle field for annihilation produce one when positron annihilates with bound atomic possible for only one photon the nuclear coulomb field breaks translational the energy the two equivalently their may determined from conservation momentum seen another the photon can considered its own the reverse pair production the dominant mechanism which energy photons such gamma rays lose energy while passing through that process the reverse annihilation one allowed the electric field atomic the classical formulae for the energy and momentum electromagnetic radiation can expressed terms photon for the pressure electromagnetic radiation object derives from the transfer photon momentum per unit time and unit area that since pressure force per unit area and force the change momentum per unit experimental checks photon mass the photon currently understood strictly but this experimental the photon not strictly massless would not move the exact speed light its speed would lower and depend its relativity would unaffected the called speed would then not the actual speed which light but constant nature which the maximum speed that any object could theoretically attain thus would still the speed time ripples gravitational waves and gravitons but would not the speed massive photon would have other effects coulomb law would modified and the electromagnetic field would have extra physical degree these effects yield more sensitive experimental probes the photon mass than the frequency dependence the speed law not exactly then that would cause the presence electric field inside hollow conductor when subjected external electric this thus allows one test coulomb law very high null result such experiment has set limit sharper upper limits have been obtained experiments designed detect effects caused the galactic vector potential although the galactic vector potential very large because the galactic magnetic field exists very long length only the magnetic field observable the photon case massive the mass term would affect the galactic the fact that such effects are seen implies upper bound the photon mass the galactic vector potential can also probed directly measuring the torque exerted magnetized such methods were used obtain the sharper upper limit the equivalent atomic mass units given the particle data group these sharp limits from the observation the effects caused the galactic vector potential have been shown model the photon mass generated via the higgs mechanism then the upper limit from the test law photons inside superconductors develop nonzero effective rest mass electromagnetic forces become range inside supernova acceleration probe historical development light thomas young slit experiment wave particle most theories the eighteenth light was pictured being made since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction diffraction and birefringence wave theories light were proposed ren descartes robert hooke and christiaan huygens however particle models remained chiefly due the influence isaac newton the early nineteenth thomas young and august fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction light and wave models were generally james clerk maxwell prediction that light was electromagnetic which was confirmed experimentally heinrich hertz detection radio waves seemed the final blow particle models maxwell theoretical model light electric magnetic fields electromagnetic radiation quanta particles photon the maxwell wave theory however does not account for all properties the maxwell theory predicts that the energy light wave depends only its intensity not its frequency nevertheless several independent types experiments show that the energy imparted light atoms depends only the not its for some chemical reactions are provoked only light frequency higher than certain light frequency lower than the matter how does not initiate the similarly electrons can ejected from metal plate shining light sufficiently high frequency the photoelectric effect the energy the ejected electron related only the not its note the same investigations blackbody radiation carried out over four decades various researchers culminated max planck hypothesis that the energy any system that absorbs emits electromagnetic radiation frequency integer multiple energy quantum shown albert einstein some form energy quantization must assumed account for the thermal equilibrium observed between matter and electromagnetic radiation for this explanation the photoelectric effect einstein received the nobel prize since the maxwell theory light allows for all possible energies electromagnetic most physicists assumed initially that the energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint the matter that absorbs emits the einstein was the first propose that energy quantization was property electromagnetic radiation although accepted the validity einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could explained the energy maxwellian light wave were localized into like quanta that move independently one even the wave itself spread continuously over and einstein showed planck law body radiation the energy quanta must also carry momentum making them fledged particles this photon momentum was observed experimentally arthur compton for which received the nobel prize the pivotal question was how unify wave theory light with its experimentally observed particle the answer this question occupied albert einstein for the rest his and was solved quantum electrodynamics and its the standard model see second quantization and the photon gauge boson below einstein light quantum unlike einstein entertained the possibility that there might actual physical quanta what now call noticed that light quantum with energy proportional its frequency would explain away number troubling puzzles and including unpublished law the ultraviolet catastrophe and course the photoelectric effect stokes law said simply that the frequency fluorescent light cannot greater than the frequency the light usually inducing eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe imagining gas photons behaving like gas electrons that had previously was advised colleague careful how wrote this order not challenge planck too was powerful and indeed the warning was planck never forgave him for writing early objections matter bohr model hydrogen atom quantum mechanics predictions were verified experimentally several ways the first two decades the recounted robert millikan nobel however before compton experiment showing that photons carried momentum proportional their wave number most physicists were reluctant believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might for the nobel lectures wien planck and instead there was widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint the matter that absorbs emits attitudes changed over the change can traced experiments such compton scattering where was much more difficult not ascribe quantization light itself explain the observed even after niels bohr hendrik kramers and john slater made one last attempt preserve the maxwellian continuous electromagnetic field model the called bks model account for the data then two drastic hypotheses had energy and momentum are conserved only the average interactions between matter and not elementary processes such absorption and this allows one reconcile the discontinuously changing energy the atom jump between energy with the continuous release energy into causality abandoned for spontaneous emissions are merely emissions induced virtual electromagnetic however refined compton experiments showed that momentum conserved extraordinarily well elementary and also that the jolting the electron and the generation new photon compton scattering obey causality within accordingly bohr and his workers gave their model honorable funeral nevertheless the failures the bks model inspired werner heisenberg his development matrix mechanics few physicists persisted developing semiclassical models which electromagnetic radiation not but matter appears obey the laws quantum mechanics although the evidence for photons from chemical and physical experiments was overwhelming the this evidence could not considered absolutely definitive since relied the interaction light with sufficiently complicated theory matter could principle account for the nevertheless all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively the and correlation note hence einstein hypothesis that quantization property light itself considered wave particle duality and uncertainty principles wave particle duality squeezed coherent state uncertainty principle bohm theory like all quantum exhibit both like and like their dual particle nature can difficult the photon displays clearly like phenomena such diffraction and interference the length scale its for single photon passing through double slit experiment lands the screen exhibiting interference phenomena but only measure was made the actual slit being run account for the particle interpretation that phenomenon called probability distribution but behaves according maxwell equations however experiments confirm that the photon not short pulse electromagnetic does not spread out nor does divide when encounters beam splitter rather the photon seems point like particle since absorbed emitted whole arbitrarily small systems much smaller than its such atomic nucleus even the like electron nevertheless the photon not like particle whose trajectory shaped probabilistically the electromagnetic field conceived einstein and that hypothesis was also refuted the correlation experiments cited according our present the electromagnetic field itself produced which turn result from local gauge symmetry and the laws quantum field theory see the second quantization and gauge boson sections heisenberg thought experiment electron gamma ray aperture angle classical optics wavelength key element quantum mechanics heisenberg uncertainty principle which forbids the simultaneous measurement the position and momentum particle along the same remarkably the uncertainty principle for material particles requires the quantization light into and even the frequency dependence the energy and elegant illustration thought experiment for locating electron with ideal the position the electron can determined within the resolving power the which given formula from classical optics where the aperture angle the thus the position uncertainty can made arbitrarily small reducing the wavelength the momentum the electron since received kick from the light scattering from into the light were not quantized into the uncertainty could made arbitrarily small reducing the that since the wavelength and intensity light can varied one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum arbitrarily high violating the uncertainty principle einstein formula for photon momentum preserves the uncertainty since the photon scattered anywhere within the the uncertainty momentum transferred equals giving the product which uncertainty thus the entire world both matter and fields must obey consistent set quantum either one the analogous uncertainty principle for photons forbids the simultaneous measurement the number photons see fock state and the second quantization section electromagnetic wave and the phase that wave see coherent state and squeezed coherent state for more both photons and material particles such electrons create analogous interference patterns when passing through double slit experiment for this corresponds the interference maxwell light wave whereas for material this corresponds the interference the schr dinger wave equation although this similarity might suggest that maxwell equations are simply equation for most physicists not for one they are mathematically most schr one equation solves for complex field whereas four equations solve for real fields more the normal concept dinger probability wave function cannot applied being they cannot localized without being technically photons cannot have position eigenstate and thus the normal heisenberg uncertainty principle does not pertain few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the but they have not come into general instead physicists generally accept the quantized theory photons described quantum electrodynamics which photons are quantized excitations electromagnetic another that avoids the bohm theory knowned also the pilot wave model the photon this theory wave and this idea seems natural and resolve the particle dilemma such clear and ordinary that great mystery that was generally bose einstein model photon gas bose gas einstein statistics statistics theorem gas box satyendra nath bose derived planck law body radiation without using any but rather modification grained counting phase space einstein showed that this modification equivalent assuming that photons are rigorously identical and that implied mysterious local now understood the requirement for symmetric quantum mechanical state this work led the concept coherent states and the development the the same einstein extended formalism material particles bosons and predicted that they would condense into their lowest quantum state low enough this bose einstein condensation was observed experimentally was later used lene hau and then completely light and the modern view this that photons virtue their integer bosons opposed fermions with integer the spin statistics theorem all bosons obey einstein statistics whereas all fermions obey fermi dirac statistics stimulated and spontaneous emission stimulated emission laser stimulated emission laser einstein showed that radiation law could derived from statistical treatment photons and which implies relation between the rates which atoms emit and absorb the condition follows from the assumption that light emitted and absorbed atoms and that the thermal equilibrium preserved interaction with consider cavity thermal equilibrium and filled with electromagnetic radiation and atoms that can emit and absorb that thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density photons with frequency which proportional their number density constant hence the rate which photons any particular frequency are emitted must equal the rate absorbing them einstein began postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates his the rate for system absorb photon frequency and transition from lower energy higher energy proportional the number atoms with energy and the energy density ambient photons with that where the rate constant for for the reverse there are two spontaneous emission and return the energy state that initiated the interaction with passing following the corresponding rate for the emission photons frequency and transition from higher energy lower energy where the rate constant for emitting photon spontaneously and the rate constant for emitting response ambient photons induced stimulated emission thermodynamic the number atoms state and that atoms state hence the rates and must also arguments analogous the derivation boltzmann statistics the ratio and where are the degeneracy the state and that respectively their the boltzmann constant and the temperature from readily derived that and the and are collectively known the einstein coefficients einstein could not fully justify his rate but claimed that should possible calculate the coefficients and once physicists had obtained mechanics and electrodynamics modified accommodate the quantum paul dirac derived the rate constants using semiclassical and succeeded deriving all the rate constants from first principles within the framework quantum dirac work was the foundation quantum the quantization the electromagnetic field dirac approach also called second quantization quantum field theory earlier quantum mechanical treatments only treat material particles quantum not the electromagnetic einstein was troubled the fact that his theory seemed since did not determine the direction spontaneously emitted probabilistic nature particle motion was first considered newton his treatment birefringence and more the splitting light beams interfaces into transmitted beam and reflected newton hypothesized that hidden variables the light particle determined which path would similarly einstein hoped for more complete theory that would leave nothing beginning his separation from quantum ironically max born probabilistic interpretation the wave function was inspired later work searching for more complete second quantization quantum field theory electromagnetic modes simple harmonic oscillators peter debye derived planck law body radiation from relatively simple correctly decomposed the electromagnetic field cavity into its fourier modes and assumed that the energy any mode was integer multiple where the frequency the electromagnetic planck law body radiation follows immediately geometric however debye approach failed give the correct formula for the energy fluctuations blackbody which were derived einstein born heisenberg and jordan reinterpreted concept key may shown the fourier modes the electromagnetic field complete set electromagnetic plane waves indexed their wave vector and polarization are equivalent set uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators treated quantum the energy levels such oscillators are known where the oscillator the key new step was identify electromagnetic mode with energy state with photons each energy this approach gives the correct energy fluctuation probability amplitude complex number feynman diagram modulus dirac took this one step treated the interaction between charge and electromagnetic field small perturbation that induces transitions the photon changing the numbers photons the while conserving energy and momentum dirac was able derive and coefficients from first and showed that the einstein statistics photons natural consequence quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly reasoning went the opposite derived planck law body radiation assuming was not yet known that all including must obey einstein dirac order perturbation theory can involve virtual photons transient intermediate states the electromagnetic the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated such virtual such quantum field theories the probability amplitude observable events calculated summing over all possible intermediate even ones that are hence virtual photons are not constrained satisfy and may have extra polarization states depending the gauge used virtual photons may have three four polarization instead the two states real although these transient virtual photons can never they contribute measurably the probabilities observable indeed such order and order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions the such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique renormalization other virtual particles may contribute the summation for two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron positron pairs such photon well photon meant one the modes operations the planned particle the international linear collider modern physics the quantum state the electromagnetic field written fock state tensor product the states for each electromagnetic mode where represents the state which photons are the mode this the creation new photon mode emitted from atomic written this notation merely expresses the concept heisenberg and jordan described and does not add any the hadronic properties the photon measurements the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show that the interaction much more intense than expected the interaction merely photons with the electric furthermore the interaction energetic photons with protons similar the interaction photons with neutrons spite the fact that the electric charge structures protons and neutrons are substantially theory called vector meson dominance was developed explain this according the photon superposition the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric and vector however experimentally probed very short the intrinsic structure the photon recognized flux quark and gluon quasi free according asymptotic freedom qcd and described the photon structure function comprehensive comparison data with theoretical predictions presented recent the photon gauge boson gauge theory the electromagnetic field can understood gauge field field that results from requiring that gauge symmetry holds independently every position spacetime for the electromagnetic field this gauge symmetry the abelian symmetry complex number which reflects the ability vary the phase complex number without affecting observables real valued functions made from such the energy the lagrangian the quanta abelian gauge field must uncharged long the symmetry not hence the photon predicted and have zero electric charge and integer the particular form the electromagnetic interaction specifies that the photon must have spin thus its helicity must these two spin components correspond the classical concepts right handed and handed circularly polarized light however the transient virtual photons quantum electrodynamics may also adopt unphysical polarization the prevailing standard model the photon one four gauge bosons the electroweak interaction the other three are denoted and and are responsible for the weak interaction unlike the these gauge bosons have mass owing mechanism that breaks their gauge symmetry the unification the photon with and gauge bosons the electroweak interaction was accomplished sheldon glashow abdus salam and steven weinberg for which they were awarded the nobel prize physicists continue hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons quantum chromodynamics however key predictions these such proton decay have not been observed contributions the mass system mass special relativity general relativity the energy system that emits photon decreased the energy the photon measured the rest frame the emitting which may result reduction mass the amount similarly the mass system that absorbs photon increased corresponding the energy balance nuclear reactions involving photons commonly written terms the masses the

modified including the mass contributions virtual technique known renormalization such radiative contribute number predictions such the magnetic dipole moment leptons the lamb shift and the hyperfine structure bound lepton such muonium and positronium since photons contribute the stress energy tensor they exert gravitational attraction other according the theory general relativity conversely photons are themselves affected their normally straight trajectories may bent warped spacetime gravitational lensing and their frequencies may lowered moving higher gravitational potential the pound rebka experiment however these effects are not specific exactly the same effects would predicted for classical electromagnetic waves photons matter group velocity photochemistry any how photons travel through matter has explain why different arrangements matter are transparent opaque different wavelengths light through carbon diamond and why individual photons behave the same way large explanations that invoke and have provide explanation for the directionality the photons reflection and further explain how entangled photon pairs can travel through matter without their quantum state the simplest explanation that light that travels through transparent matter does lower speed than the speed light light can also undergo scattering and absorption there are circumstances which heat transfer through material mostly involving emission and absorption photons within example would the core the energy can take about million years reach the however this phenomenon distinct from scattered radiation passing diffusely through involves local equilibrium between the radiation and the thus the time how long takes the energy not the photons themselves once open photon from the sun takes only minutes reach the factor which the speed light decreased material called the refractive index the classical wave the slowing can explained the light inducing electric polarization the the polarized matter radiating new and the new light interfering with the original light wave form delayed particle the slowing can instead described blending the photon with quantum excitation the matter quasi particles such phonons and excitons form polariton this polariton has nonzero effective mass which means that cannot travel alternatively photons may viewed always traveling even but they have their phase shifted delayed upon interaction with atomic this modifies their wavelength and but not light wave made these photons does travel slower than the speed this view the photons are bare and are scattered and phase while the view the preceding paragraph the photons are dressed their interaction with and move without scattering phase but lower light different frequencies may travel through matter different speeds this called dispersion some can result extremely slow speeds light the effects photon interactions with other particles may observed directly raman scattering and brillouin scattering photons can also absorbed atoms provoking transitions between their energy levels classic example the molecular transition retinal which responsible for vision discovered nobel laureate biochemist george wald and the absorption provokes cis trans isomerization that combination with other such transduced into nerve the absorption photons can even break chemical the photodissociation chlorine this the subject photochemistry analogously gamma rays can some circumstances dissociate atomic nuclei process called photodisintegration technological applications photons have many applications these examples are chosen illustrate applications photons per rather than general optical devices such etc that could operate under classical theory the laser extremely important application and discussed above under stimulated emission individual photons can detected several the classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect photon landing metal plate ejects initiating amplifying avalanche charge coupled device chips use similar effect semiconductors incident photon generates charge microscopic capacitor that can other detectors such geiger counters use the ability photons ionize gas causing detectable change conductivity planck energy formula often used engineers and chemists both compute the change energy resulting from photon absorption and predict the frequency the light emitted for given energy for the emission spectrum fluorescent light bulb can designed using gas molecules with different electronic energy levels and adjusting the typical energy with which electron hits the gas molecules within the note under some energy transition can excited two photons that individually would this allows for higher resolution because the sample absorbs energy only the region where two beams different colors overlap which can made much smaller than the excitation volume single beam see two photon excitation microscopy moreover these photons cause less damage the since they are lower some two energy transitions can coupled one system absorbs another nearby system steals its energy and emits photon different this the basis
