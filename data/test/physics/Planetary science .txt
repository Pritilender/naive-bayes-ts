interdisciplinary field originally growing from astronomy and earth science but which now incorporates many including planetary astronomy planetary geology together with geochemistry and geophysics atmospheric science oceanography hydrology theoretical planetary science glaciology and exoplanetology allied disciplines include space physics when concerned with the effects the sun the bodies the solar and astrobiology there are interrelated observational and theoretical branches planetary observational research can involve combination space exploration predominantly with robotic spacecraft missions using remote sensing and experimental work based the theoretical component involves considerable computer simulation and mathematical planetary scientists are generally located the astronomy

history planetary science may said have begun with the ancient greek philosopher democritus who reported hippolytus saying the ordered worlds are boundless and differ and that some there neither sun nor but that both are greater than with and yet with others more and that the intervals between the ordered worlds are here more and there and that some others flourish and others and here they come into being and there they are but that they are destroyed colliding with one and that some ordered worlds are bare animals and plants and all more modern planetary science began from studies the unresolved this the original planetary astronomer would galileo who discovered the four largest moons jupiter the mountains the moon and first observed the rings saturn all objects intense later galileo study the lunar mountains also began the study extraterrestrial his observation that the moon certainly does not possess smooth and polished suggested that and other worlds might appear just like the face the earth advances telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification the atmospheric and surface details the the moon was initially the most heavily always exhibited details its due its proximity the and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological this scientific the main instruments were astronomical optical telescopes and later radio telescopes and finally robotic exploratory spacecraft the solar system has now been relatively and good overall understanding the formation and evolution this planetary system however there are large numbers unsolved and the rate new discoveries very partly due the large number interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the solar disciplines planetary astronomy this both observational and theoretical observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study the small bodies the solar those that are observed both optical and that characteristics these bodies such spin surface materials and weathering are and the history their formation and evolution can theoretical planetary astronomy concerned with dynamics the application the principles celestial mechanics the solar system and extrasolar planetary planetary geology planetary geology geology solar terrestrial planets icy moon the best known research topics planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies the near vicinity the the moon and the two neighbouring venus and mars the moon was studied using methods developed earlier the geomorphology geomorphology geomorphology studies the features planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history their inferring the physical processes that acted the planetary geomorphology includes study several classes surface impact features ringed craters volcanic and tectonic features lava fissures rilles space weathering erosional effects generated the harsh environment space continuous micrometeorite high energy particle impact gardening for the thin dust cover the surface the lunar regolith result micrometeorite hydrological the liquid involved can range from water hydrocarbon and ammonia depending the location within the solar the history planetary surface can deciphered mapping features from top bottom according their deposition sequence first determined terrestrial strata nicolas steno for stratigraphic mapping prepared the apollo astronauts for the field geology they would encounter their lunar overlapping sequences were identified images taken the lunar orbiter program and these were used prepare lunar stratigraphic column and geological map the geology the moon geochemistry and petrology cosmochemistry geochemistry petrology one the main problems when generating hypotheses the formation and evolution objects the solar system the lack samples that can analysed the where large suite tools are available and the full body knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can brought fortunately direct samples from the asteroids and mars are present removed from their parent bodies and delivered meteorites some these have suffered contamination from the oxidising effect atmosphere and the infiltration the biosphere but those meteorites collected the last few decades from antarctica are almost entirely the different types meteorite that originate from the asteroid belt cover almost all parts the structure differentiated bodies meteorites even exist that come from the mantle boundary pallasites the combination geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made possible trace the hed meteorites back specific asteroid the main vesta the comparatively few known martian meteorites have provided insight into the geochemical composition the martian although the unavoidable lack information about their points origin the diverse martian surface has meant that they not provide more detailed constraints theories the evolution the martian lithosphere july samples martian meteorites have been discovered many were found either antarctica the sahara during the apollo the apollo program kilograms lunar samples were collected and transported the and soviet luna robots also delivered regolith samples from the these samples provide the most comprehensive record the composition any solar system body beside the the numbers lunar meteorites are growing quickly the last few years april there are meteorites that have been officially classified eleven these are from the antarctic meteorite are from the japanese antarctic meteorite and the other are from hot
