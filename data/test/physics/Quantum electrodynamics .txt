contributions from wolfgang pauli eugene wigner pascual jordan werner heisenberg and elegant formulation quantum electrodynamics due enrico fermi physicists came believe would possible perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged however further studies felix bloch with arnold nordsieck and victor weisskopf and revealed that such computations were reliable only first order perturbation theory problem already pointed out robert oppenheimer higher orders the series infinities making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts the internal consistency the theory with solution for this problem known the appeared that fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics hans bethe difficulties with the theory increased through the end improvements microwave technology made possible take more precise measurements the shift the levels hydrogen atom now known the lamb shift and magnetic moment the these experiments unequivocally exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable first indication possible way out was given hans bethe while was traveling train reach schenectady from new york after giving talk the conference shelter island the bethe completed the first relativistic computation the shift the lines the hydrogen atom measured lamb and despite the limitations the agreement was the idea was simply attach infinities corrections mass and charge that were actually fixed finite value this the infinities get absorbed those constants and yield finite result good agreement with this procedure was named renormalization feynman oppenheimer los alamos based intuition and fundamental papers the subject sin itiro tomonaga julian schwinger richard feynman and freeman dyson was finally possible get fully covariant formulations that were finite any order perturbation series quantum sin itiro tomonaga julian schwinger and richard feynman were jointly awarded with nobel prize physics for their work this their and those freeman dyson were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations quantum electrodynamics that allow computations observables any order perturbation theory feynman mathematical based his diagrams initially seemed very different from the operator based approach schwinger and but freeman dyson later showed that the two approaches were renormalization the need attach physical meaning certain divergences appearing the theory through integrals has subsequently become one the fundamental aspects quantum field theory and has come seen criterion for general even though renormalization works very well feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical even referring renormalization shell and hocus qed has served the model and template for all subsequent quantum field one such subsequent theory quantum chromodynamics which began the early and attained its present form the work david politzer sidney coleman david gross and frank wilczek building the pioneering work schwinger gerald guralnik dick hagen and tom kibble peter higgs jeffrey goldstone and sheldon glashow steven weinberg and abdus salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could merged into single electroweak force feynman view quantum electrodynamics introduction near the end his richard feynman gave series lectures qed intended for the lay these lectures were transcribed and published feynman qed the strange theory light and matter classic mathematical exposition qed from the point view articulated the key components presentation qed are three basic photon goes from one place and time another place and electron goes from one place and time another place and electron emits absorbs photon certain place and feynman diagram these actions are represented form visual shorthand the three basic elements feynman diagrams wavy line for the straight line for the electron and junction two straight lines and wavy one for vertex representing emission absorption photon these can all seen the adjacent important not interpret these nothing implied about how particle gets from one point the diagrams not imply that the particles are moving straight curved they not imply that the particles are moving with fixed the fact that the photon often wavy line and not straight one does not imply that thought that more wavelike than the images are just symbols represent the actions photons and electrons somehow move from point point and somehow emit and absorb not know how these things but the theory tells about the probabilities these things well the visual shorthand for the actions feynman introduces another kind shorthand for the numerical quantities called probability amplitudes the probability the square the total probability photon moves from one place and another place and the associated quantity written shorthand the similar quantity for electron moving from written the quantity which tells about the probability amplitude for the emission absorption photon calls this related but not the same the measured electron charge qed based the assumption that complex interactions many electrons and photons can represented fitting together suitable collection the above three building and then using the probability amplitudes calculate the probability any such complex turns out that the basic idea qed can communicated while making the assumption that the square the total the probability amplitudes mentioned above and just our everyday probability simplification later this will corrected include specifically quantum following the basic rules probability amplitudes that will used are that event can happen variety different ways then its probability amplitude the sum the probability amplitudes the possible ways and process involves number independent processes then its probability amplitude the product the component probability basic constructions suppose start with one electron certain place and time this place and time being given the arbitrary label and photon another place and time given the label typical question from physical standpoint what the probability finding electron another place and later and photon yet another place and the simplest process achieve this end for the electron move from elementary and for the photon move from another elementary from knowledge the probability amplitudes each these processes and then would expect calculate the probability amplitude both happening together multiplying using rule above this gives simple estimated overall probability which squared give estimated compton scattering but there are other ways which the end result could come the electron might move place and time where absorbs the then move before emitting another photon then move where while the new photon moves the probability this complex process can again calculated knowing the probability amplitudes each the individual three electron two photon actions and two vertexes one emission and one would expect find the total probability amplitude multiplying the probability amplitudes each the for any chosen positions and using rule above have add all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for and this not elementary and involves integration but there another which that the electron first moves where emits photon which goes while the electron moves where absorbs the first before moving again can calculate the probability amplitude these possibilities for all points and then have better estimation for the total probability amplitude adding the probability amplitudes these two possibilities our original simple incidentally the name given this process photon interacting with electron this way compton scattering there are infinite number other intermediate processes which more and more photons are absorbed for each these possibilities there feynman diagram describing this implies complex computation for the resulting probability but provided the case that the more complicated the diagram the less contributes the only matter time and effort find accurate answer one wants the original this the basic approach calculate the probability any interactive process between electrons and photons matter first with feynman all the possible ways which the process can constructed from the three basic each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules find the associated probability that basic scaffolding remains when one moves quantum description but some conceptual changes are one that whereas might expect our everyday life that there would some constraints the points which particle can that not true full quantum there possibility electron photon moving basic action any other place and time the universe that includes places that could only reached speeds greater than that light and also earlier times electron moving backwards time can viewed positron moving forward probability amplitudes quantum mechanics introduces important change the way probabilities are probabilities are still represented the usual real numbers use for probabilities our everyday but probabilities are computed the square probability probability amplitudes are complex numbers feynman avoids exposing the reader the mathematics complex numbers using simple but accurate representation them arrows piece paper these must not confused with the arrows feynman diagrams which are actually simplified representations two dimensions relationship between points three dimensions space and one the amplitude arrows are fundamental the description the world given quantum satisfactory reason has been given for why they are but pragmatically have accept that they are essential part our description all quantum they are related our everyday ideas probability the simple rule that the probability event the square the length the corresponding amplitude for given two probability and are the probability the process will given either the rules regards adding however are the same but where you would expect add multiply instead you add multiply probability amplitudes that now are complex addition and multiplication are familiar operations the theory complex numbers and are given the the sum found let the start the second arrow the end the the sum then third arrow that goes directly from the start the first the end the the product two arrows arrow whose length the product the two the direction the product found adding the angles that each the two have been turned through relative reference that gives the angle that the product turned relative the reference that from probabilities probability complicates the mathematics without changing the basic but that change still not quite enough because fails take into account the fact that both photons and electrons can which say that their orientations space and time have taken into therefore actually consists complex probability amplitude there are also some minor changes with the quantity which may have rotated multiple for some which only interest for the detailed associated with the fact that the electron can polarized another small necessary detail which connected with the fact that electron fermion and obeys fermi dirac statistics the basic rule that have the probability amplitude for given complex process involving more than one then when include always the complementary feynman diagram which just exchange two electron the resulting amplitude the reverse the negative the the simplest case would two electrons starting and ending and the amplitude would calculated the difference where would from our everyday idea that would propagators finally one has compute and corresponding the probability amplitudes for the photon and the electron these are essentially the solutions the dirac equation which describes the behavior the probability amplitude and the klein gordon equation which describes the behavior the probability these are called feynman propagators the translation notation commonly used the standard literature where shorthand symbol such stands for the four real numbers which give the time and position three dimensions the point labeled mass renormalization self energy electron energy problem arose historically which held progress for twenty although start with the assumption three basic simple actions the rules the game say that want calculate the probability amplitude for electron get from must take into account all the possible all possible feynman diagrams with those end thus there will way which the electron travels emits photon there and then absorbs again before moving could this kind thing short have fractal like situation which look closely line breaks into collection simple lines each looked are turn composed simple lines and infinitum this very difficult situation adding that detail only altered things slightly then would not have been too but disaster struck when was found that the simple correction mentioned above led infinite probability time this problem was fixed the technique renormalization however feynman himself remained unhappy about calling dippy conclusions within the above framework physicists were then able calculate high degree accuracy some the properties such the anomalous magnetic dipole moment however feynman points fails totally explain why particles such the electron have the masses they there theory that adequately explains these use the numbers all our but understand them what they where they come believe that from fundamental point this very interesting and serious quantum field theory quantum field theory theory that brings quantum mechanics and special relativity together account for subatomic mathematics mathematically qed abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group the gauge field which mediates the interaction between the charged spin fields the electromagnetic field the qed lagrangian for field interacting with the electromagnetic field given the real part where dirac matrices bispinor field electron positron dirac adjoint gauge covariant derivative coupling constant electric charge covariant potential electromagnetic field tensor equations motion substituting the definition into the lagrangian gives can substitute this lagrangian into the euler lagrange equation motion for find the field equations for the two terms from this lagrangian are then substituting these two back into the lagrange equation results with complex conjugate bringing the middle term the hand side transforms this second equation into the hand side like the original dirac equation and the hand side the interaction with the electromagnetic one further important equation can found substituting the lagrangian into another lagrange this time for the the two terms this time are and these two when substituted back into give impose the lorenz gauge condition that the divergence the four potential vanishes then get which wave equation for the four the qed version the classical maxwell equations the lorenz the above the square represents the alembert operator interaction picture this theory can straightforwardly quantized treating bosonic and fermionic sectors this permits build set asymptotic states which can used start computation the probability amplitudes for different order have compute evolution operator that for given initial state will give final state such way have this technique also known the matrix the evolution operator obtained the interaction picture where time evolution given the interaction which the integral over space the second term the lagrangian density given and one has where the time ordering operator this evolution operator only has meaning and what get here perturbation series with the fine structure constant the development this series called the dyson series feynman diagrams despite the conceptual clarity this feynman approach almost early textbooks follow him their when performing calculations much easier work with the fourier transforms the propagators quantum physics considers momenta rather than their and convenient think particles being created annihilated when they feynman diagrams then look the but the lines have different the electron line represents electron with given energy and with similar interpretation the photon vertex diagram represents the annihilation one electron and the creation another together with the absorption creation each having specified energies and using wick theorem the terms the dyson all the terms the matrix for quantum electrodynamics can computed through the technique feynman diagrams this case rules for drawing are the following these rules must add further one for closed loops that implies integration momenta since these internal virtual particles are not constrained any specific momentum even that usually required special relativity see this article for from computations probability amplitudes are straightforwardly example compton scattering with electron and photon undergoing elastic scattering feynman diagrams are this case and are able get the corresponding amplitude the first order perturbation series for the matrix from which are able compute the cross section for this renormalizability higher order terms can straightforwardly computed for the evolution operator but these terms display diagrams containing the following simpler ones one loop contribution the vacuum polarization function one loop contribution the electron self energy function one loop contribution the vertex function that being closed imply the presence diverging integrals having mathematical overcome this technique called renormalization has been producing finite results very close agreement with important note that criterion for theory being meaningful after renormalization that the number diverging diagrams this case the theory said renormalizable the reason for this that get observables renormalized one needs finite number constants maintain the predictive value the theory this exactly the case quantum electrodynamics displaying just three diverging this procedure gives observables very close agreement with experiment seen for electron gyromagnetic ratio renormalizability has become essential criterion for quantum field theory considered viable all the theories describing fundamental interactions except gravitation whose quantum counterpart presently under very active are renormalizable nonconvergence series argument freeman dyson shows that the radius convergence the perturbation series qed the basic argument goes the coupling constant were this would equivalent the coulomb force constant being this would reverse the electromagnetic interaction that like charges would attract and unlike charges would repel this would render the vacuum unstable against decay into cluster electrons one side the universe and cluster positrons the other side the because the theory for any negative value the coupling the series not but are asymptotic series from modern say that qed not well defined qft arbitrarily high the coupling constant runs infinity finite signalling
