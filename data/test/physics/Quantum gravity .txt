gravity field theoretical physics that seeks describe the force gravity according the principles quantum mechanics the current understanding gravity based albert einstein general theory relativity which formulated within the framework classical physics the other the nongravitational forces are described within the framework quantum radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based probability the necessity quantum mechanical description gravity follows from the fact that one cannot consistently couple classical system quantum although quantum theory gravity needed order reconcile general relativity with the principles quantum difficulties arise when one attempts apply the usual prescriptions quantum field theory the force from technical point the problem that the theory one gets this way not renormalizable and therefore cannot used make meaningful physical theorists have taken more radical approaches the problem quantum the most popular approaches being string theory and loop quantum gravity strictly the aim quantum gravity only describe the quantum behavior the gravitational field and should not confused with the objective unifying all fundamental interactions into single mathematical although some quantum gravity theories such string theory try unify gravity with the other fundamental forces others such loop quantum gravity make such instead they make effort quantize the gravitational field while kept separate from the other theory quantum gravity which also grand unification all known sometimes referred theory everything one the

tests see also references further reading overview list unsolved problems physics how can the theory quantum mechanics merged with the theory general relativity gravitational force and remain correct microscopic length what verifiable predictions does any theory quantum gravity much the difficulty meshing these theories all energy scales comes from the different assumptions that these theories make how the universe quantum field theory depends particle fields embedded the flat time special relativity general relativity models gravity curvature within space time that changes gravitational mass historically the most obvious way combining the two such treating gravity simply another particle ran quickly into what known the renormalization problem the fashioned understanding gravity particles would attract each other and adding together all the interactions results many infinite values which cannot easily cancelled out mathematically yield finite this contrast with quantum electrodynamics where while the series still not the interactions sometimes evaluate infinite but those are few enough number removable via effective field theories quantum gravity can treated effective field theory effective quantum field theories come with some energy beyond which not expect that the theory provides good description the infinities then become large but finite quantities depending this finite cutoff and correspond processes that involve very high energies near the fundamental these quantities can then absorbed into infinite collection coupling and energies well below the fundamental cutoff the any desired only finite number these coupling constants need measured order make legitimate mechanical this same logic works just well for the highly successful theory energy pions for quantum indeed the first mechanical corrections graviton scattering and newton law gravitation have been explicitly computed although they are astronomically small that may never able measure gravity many ways much better quantum field theory than the standard model since appears valid all the way its cutoff the planck scale while confirming that quantum mechanics and gravity are indeed consistent reasonable clear that near above the fundamental cutoff our effective quantum theory gravity the cutoff generally assumed the order the planck new model nature will specifically the problem combining quantum mechanics and gravity becomes issue only very high and may well require totally new kind quantum gravity theory for the highest energy scales the general approach deriving quantum gravity theory that valid even the highest energy scales assume that such theory will simple and elegant accordingly study symmetries and other clues offered current theories that might suggest ways combine them into unified one problem with this approach that unknown whether quantum gravity will actually conform simple and elegant should resolve the dual conundrums special relativity with regard the uniformity acceleration and gravity and general relativity with regard spacetime curvature such theory required order understand problems involving the combination very high energy and very small dimensions such the behavior black holes and the origin the universe quantum mechanics and general relativity gravity probe the graviton graviton one the deepest problems theoretical physics harmonizing the theory general relativity which describes and applications scale structures stars planets galaxies with quantum mechanics which describes the other three fundamental forces acting the atomic scale this problem must put the proper however contrary the popular claim that quantum mechanics and general relativity are fundamentally one can demonstrate that the structure general relativity essentially follows inevitably from the quantum mechanics interacting theoretical spin massless particles called gravitons while there concrete proof the existence quantized theories matter may necessitate their citation needed supporting this theory the observation that all fundamental forces except gravity have one more known messenger particles leading researchers believe that least one most likely does they have dubbed these hypothetical particles gravitons the predicted find would result the classification the graviton force particle similar the photon the electromagnetic many the accepted notions unified theory physics since the and some degree depend the existence the these include string theory superstring theory theory and loop quantum gravity detection gravitons thus vital the validation various lines research unify quantum mechanics and relativity the dilaton dilaton the dilaton made its first appearance kaluza klein theory dimensional theory that combined gravitation and electromagnetism generally appears string theory more has appeared the dimensional bodied gravity problem based the field theoretic approach roman jackiw the impetus arose from the fact that complete analytical solutions for the metric covariant body system have proven elusive general simplify the the number dimensions was lowered namely one spatial dimension and one temporal this model known theory opposed the general theory was amenable exact solutions terms generalization the lambert function was also found that the field equation governing the dilaton derived from differential geometry was the schr dinger equation and consequently amenable thus one had theory which combined quantization and even the electromagnetic promising ingredients fundamental physical worth noting that the outcome revealed previously unknown and already existing natural link between general relativity and quantum however this theory needs generalized dimensions the field equations are amenable such generalization shown with the inclusion graviton process and yielding the correct newtonian limit dimensions dilaton however not yet clear what the fully generalized field equation governing the dilaton dimensions should this further complicated the fact that gravitons can propagate dimensions and consequently that would imply gravitons and dilatons exist the real moreover detection the dilaton expected even more elusive than the however since this approach allows for the combination electromagnetic and quantum their coupling could potentially lead means vindicating the through cosmology and perhaps even experimentally nonrenormalizability gravity renormalization general like electromagnetism classical field theory one might expect with there should corresponding quantum field theory however gravity perturbatively nonrenormalizable for quantum field theory defined according this understanding the must asymptotically free asymptotically safe the theory must characterized choice finitely many parameters which set for quantum electrodynamics these parameters are the charge and mass the measured particular energy the other quantizing there are infinitely many independent parameters counterterm needed define the for given choice those one could make sense the but since can never infinitely many experiments fix the values every not have meaningful physical low the logic the renormalization group tells despite the unknown choices these infinitely many quantum gravity will reduce the usual einstein theory general relativity the other could probe very high energies where quantum effects take then every one the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin and could make predictions explained there way around this problem treating effective field theory any meaningful theory quantum gravity that makes sense and predictive all energy scales must have some deep principle that reduces the infinitely many unknown parameters finite number that can then one possibility that normal perturbation theory not reliable guide the renormalizability the and that there really fixed point for since this question non perturbative quantum field difficult find reliable but some people still pursue this another possibility that there are new symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them finite this the route taken string theory where all the excitations the string essentially manifest themselves new effective field theory effective field theory effective field theory all but the first few the infinite set parameters renormalizable theory are suppressed huge energy scales and hence can neglected when computing energy thus least the energy the model indeed predictive quantum field very similar situation occurs for the very similar effective field theory energy furthermore many theorists agree that even the standard model should really regarded effective field theory with nonrenormalizable interactions suppressed large energy scales and whose effects have consequently not been observed recent work has shown that treating general relativity effective field theory one can actually make legitimate predictions for quantum least for energy example the known calculation the tiny order mechanical correction the classical newtonian gravitational potential between two spacetime background dependence background independence fundamental lesson general relativity that there fixed spacetime found newtonian mechanics and special relativity the spacetime geometry while easy grasp this the hardest idea understand about general and its consequences are profound and not fully even the classical certain general relativity can seen relational theory which the only physically relevant information the relationship between different events the other quantum mechanics has depended since its inception fixed background structure the case quantum time that given and not just newtonian classical relativistic quantum field just classical field minkowski spacetime the fixed background the string theory world lines particles standard model world sheet strings string theory can seen generalization quantum field theory where instead point string like objects propagate fixed spacetime although the interactions among closed strings give rise time dynamical although string theory had its origins the study quark confinement and not quantum was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the graviton and that condensation certain vibration modes strings equivalent modification the original this string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect perturbation theory that may exhibit strong dependence asymptotics for the ads cft correspondence which weak form background dependence background independent theories loop quantum gravity the fruit effort formulate background independent quantum topological quantum field theory provided example independent quantum but with local degrees and only finitely many degrees freedom this inadequate describe gravity dimensions which has local degrees freedom according general dimensions however gravity topological field and has been successfully quantized several different including spin networks semi classical quantum gravity quantum field theory curved backgrounds while not full quantum theory has shown many promising early analogous way the development quantum electrodynamics the early part the century when physicists considered quantum mechanics classical electromagnetic the consideration quantum field theory curved background has led predictions such black hole phenomena such the unruh effect which particles exist certain accelerating frames but not stationary not pose any difficulty when considered curved background the unruh effect occurs even flat minkowskian the vacuum state the state with least energy and may may not contain see quantum field theory curved spacetime for more complete points tension there are other points tension between quantum mechanics and general first classical general relativity breaks down and quantum mechanics becomes inconsistent with general relativity the neighborhood singularities one certain that classical general relativity applies near singularities the first second not clear how determine the gravitational field since under the heisenberg uncertainty principle quantum mechanics its location and velocity cannot known with the resolution these points may come from better understanding general third there the problem time quantum time has different meaning quantum mechanics and general relativity and hence there are subtle issues resolve when trying formulate theory which combines the candidate theories there are number proposed quantum gravity currently there still complete and consistent quantum theory and the candidate models still need overcome major formal and conceptual they also face the common problem there way put quantum gravity predictions experimental although there hope for this change future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes string theory string theory yau manifold compactifying one suggested starting point ordinary quantum field theories after are successful describing the other three basic fundamental forces the context the standard model elementary particle physics however while this leads acceptable effective field theory gravity low gravity turns out much more problematic higher where for ordinary field theories such quantum electrodynamics technique known renormalization integral part deriving predictions which take into account energy gravity turns out nonrenormalizable high applying the recipes ordinary quantum field theory yields models that are devoid all predictive one attempt overcome these limitations replace ordinary quantum field theory which based the classical concept point particle with quantum theory dimensional extended string theory the energies reached current these strings are indistinguishable from like but crucially different modes oscillation one and the same type fundamental string appear particles with different electric and charges this string theory promises unified description all particles and the theory successful that one mode will always correspond graviton the messenger particle however the price pay are unusual features such six extra dimensions space addition the usual three for space and one for what called the second superstring revolution was conjectured that both string theory and unification general relativity and supersymmetry known supergravity form part hypothesized dimensional model known theory which would constitute uniquely defined and consistent theory quantum presently however string theory admits very large number some consistent comprising the called string landscape sorting through this large family solutions remains major loop quantum gravity loop quantum gravity spin network loop quantum gravity based first all the idea take seriously the insight general relativity that spacetime dynamical field and therefore quantum the second idea that the quantum discreteness that determines the like behavior other field theories for the photons the electromagnetic affects also the structure the main result loop quantum gravity the derivation granular structure space the planck this derived the case the quantum operator representing the energy each frequency the field has discrete therefore the energy each frequency and the quanta are the the case the operators representing the area and the volume each surface space region have discrete therefore area and volume any portion space are and the quanta

theorem would not valid citation needed experimental tests was emphasized quantum gravitational effects are extremely weak and therefore difficult for this the possibility experimentally testing quantum gravity had not received much attention prior the late however the past physicists have realized that evidence for quantum gravitational effects can guide the development the since the
