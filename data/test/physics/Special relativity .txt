contraction time dilation relativistic mass mass energy equivalence universal speed limit and relativity simultaneity has replaced the conventional notion absolute universal time with the notion time that dependent reference frame and spatial position rather than invariant time interval between two there invariant spacetime interval combined with other laws the two postulates special relativity predict the equivalence mass and energy expressed the mass energy equivalence formula where the speed light defining feature special relativity the replacement the galilean transformations classical mechanics with the lorentz transformations time and space cannot defined separately from one rather space and time are interwoven into single continuum known spacetime events that occur the same time for one observer could occur different times for the theory called special because applied the principle relativity only the special case inertial reference frames einstein later published paper general relativity apply the principle the general that any frame handle general coordinate transformations and gravitational effects galilean relativity now considered approximation special

external links original works special relativity for general audience mathematical knowledge special relativity explained using simple more advanced visualization postulates albert autobiographical notes einstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed the most regardless the exact validity the known laws either mechanics these propositions were the constancy the speed light and the independence physical laws especially the constancy the speed from the choice inertial his initial presentation special relativity expressed these postulates the principle relativity the laws which the states physical systems undergo change are not whether these changes state referred the one the other two systems uniform translatory motion relative each the principle invariant light speed light always propagated empty space with definite velocity which independent the state motion the emitting from the that light vacuum propagates with the speed fixed independent least one system inertial coordinates the stationary regardless the state motion the light the derivation special relativity depends not only these two explicit but also several tacit assumptions made almost all theories physics including the isotropy and homogeneity space and the independence measuring rods and clocks from their past following original presentation special relativity many different sets postulates have been proposed various alternative however the most common set postulates remains those employed einstein his original more mathematical statement the principle relativity made later which introduces the concept simplicity not mentioned above special principle relativity system coordinates chosen relation physical laws hold good their simplest the same laws hold good relation any other system coordinates moving uniform translation relatively henri provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory proving that lorentz transformations are subset his poincar group symmetry einstein later derived these transformations from his many papers present derivations the lorentz transformation based upon these two einstein consistently based the derivation lorentz invariance the essential core special just the two basic principles relativity and speed the insight fundamental for the special theory relativity the assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible relations new type lorentz are postulated for the conversion coordinates and times the universal principle the special theory relativity contained the the laws physics are invariant with respect lorentz transformations for the transition from one inertial system any other arbitrarily chosen inertial this restricting principle for natural thus many modern treatments special relativity base the single postulate universal lorentz equivalently the single postulate minkowski spacetime from the principle relativity alone without assuming the constancy the speed light using the isotropy space and the symmetry implied the principle special one can show that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either galilean the lorentzian one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and certain finite limiting experiments suggest that this speed the speed light the constancy the speed light was motivated maxwell theory electromagnetism and the lack evidence for the luminiferous ether there conflicting evidence the extent which einstein was influenced the null result the michelson morley experiment any the null result the morley experiment helped the notion the constancy the speed light gain widespread and rapid lack absolute reference frame the principle relativity which states that there preferred inertial reference frame dates back galileo and was incorporated into newtonian however the late the existence electromagnetic waves led physicists suggest that the universe was filled with substance that they called aether which would act the medium through which these vibrations the aether was thought constitute absolute reference frame against which speeds could and could considered fixed and aether supposedly possessed some wonderful was sufficiently elastic support electromagnetic and those waves could interact with yet offered resistance bodies passing through the results various including the michelson morley experiment indicated that the earth was always relative the aether something that was difficult since the earth orbit around the einstein solution was discard the notion aether and the absolute state any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws the speed light vacuum always measured even when measured multiple systems that are moving different but velocities reference coordinates and the lorentz transformation lorentz transformation principle relativity relativity theory depends reference frames the term reference frame used here observational perspective space which not undergoing any change motion from which position can measured along spatial reference frame has the ability determine measurements the time events using any reference device with uniform event occurrence that can assigned single unique time and location space relative reference point spacetime since the speed light constant relativity each and every reference pulses light can used unambiguously measure distances and refer back the times that events occurred the even though light takes time reach the clock after the event has for the explosion firecracker may considered event can completely specify event its four spacetime the time occurrence and its dimensional spatial location define reference let call this reference frame relativity theory often want calculate the position point from different reference suppose have second reference frame whose spatial axes and clock exactly coincide with that time but moving constant velocity with respect along the since there absolute reference frame relativity concept doesn strictly everything always moving with respect some other reference instead any two frames that move the same speed the same direction are said comoving therefore and are not comoving define the event have spacetime coordinates system and then the lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related the following where the lorentz factor and the speed light and the velocity parallel the the and coordinates are only the and coordinates are these lorentz transformations form one parameter group linear mappings that parameter being called rapidity there nothing special about the the transformation can apply the axes indeed any which can done directions parallel the motion which are warped the factor and see main article for quantity invariant under lorentz transformations known lorentz scalar writing the lorentz transformation and its inverse terms coordinate where for instance one event has coordinates and another event has coordinates and and the differences are defined get these effects are not merely they are explicitly related our way measuring time intervals between events which occur the same place given coordinate system called events these time intervals will different another coordinate system moving with respect the unless the events are also similarly these effects also relate our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events given coordinate system these events are not but are separated distance they will not occur the same spatial distance from each other when seen from another moving coordinate however the spacetime interval will the same for all the underlying reality remains the only our perspective consequences derived from the lorentz transformation twin paradox relativistic mechanics the consequences special relativity can derived from the lorentz transformation equations these and hence special lead different physical predictions than those newtonian mechanics when relative velocities become comparable the speed the speed light much larger than anything humans encounter that some the effects predicted relativity are initially counterintuitive relativity simultaneity relativity simultaneity two events happening two different locations that occur simultaneously the reference frame one inertial may occur simultaneously the reference frame another inertial observer lack absolute simultaneity from the first equation the lorentz transformation terms coordinate differences clear that two events that are simultaneous frame satisfying are not necessarily simultaneous another inertial frame satisfying only these events are additionally local frame satisfying will they simultaneous another frame time dilation time dilation the time lapse between two events not invariant from one observer but dependent the relative speeds the reference frames the twin paradox which concerns twin who flies off spaceship traveling near the speed light and returns discover that his her twin sibling has aged much suppose clock rest the unprimed system two different ticks this clock are then characterized find the relation between the times between these ticks measured both the first equation can used this shows that the time between the two ticks seen the frame which the clock moving longer than the time between these ticks measured the rest frame the clock time dilation explains number physical for the decay rate muons produced cosmic rays impinging the length contraction lorentz contraction the dimensions length object measured one observer may smaller than the results measurements the same object made another observer the ladder paradox involves long ladder traveling near the speed light and being contained within smaller similarly suppose measuring rod rest and aligned along the axis the unprimed system this the length this rod written measure the length this rod the system which the clock the distances the end points the rod must measured simultaneously that system other the measurement characterized which can combined with the fourth equation find the relation between the lengths and this shows that the length the rod measured the frame which moving shorter than its length its own rest frame composition velocities velocity addition formula velocities not simply the observer measures object moving along the axis velocity then the observer the system frame reference moving velocity the direction with respect will measure the object moving with velocity where from the lorentz transformations the other frame will notice that the object were moving the speed light the system then would also moving the speed light the system also both and are small with respect the speed will recover the intuitive galilean transformation velocities the usual example given that train frame above traveling due east with velocity with respect the tracks frame child inside the train throws baseball due east with velocity with respect the classical observer rest the tracks will measure the velocity the baseball due while special relativity this longer instead the velocity the baseball due given the second again there nothing special about the east this formalism applies any direction considering parallel and perpendicular motion the direction relative velocity see main article for einstein addition colinear velocities consistent with the fizeau experiment which determined the speed light fluid moving parallel the but experiment has ever tested the formula for the general case parallel citation needed other consequences thomas rotation thomas rotation the orientation object the alignment its axes with the may different for different unlike other relativistic this effect becomes quite significant fairly low velocities can seen the spin moving particles equivalence mass and energy mass energy equivalence speed approaches the speed light from point its relativistic mass increases thereby making more and more difficult accelerate from within the frame the energy content object rest with mass equals conservation energy implies any decrease the sum the masses particles must accompanied increase kinetic energies the particles after the similarly the mass object can increased taking kinetic addition the papers referenced which give derivations the lorentz transformation and describe the foundations special einstein also wrote least four papers giving heuristic arguments for the equivalence and mass and for mass energy equivalence consequence special the energy and which are separate newtonian form four vector and this relates the time component the the space components the nontrivial for object the momentum vector has time component which the and three space components which are changing frames with lorentz transformation the direction with small value the velocity the energy momentum vector becomes the momentum equal the energy multiplied the velocity divided the newtonian mass which the ratio the momentum the velocity for slow equal the energy and momentum are properties matter and and impossible deduce that they form vector just from the two basic postulates special relativity because these talk about matter they only talk about space and the derivation therefore requires some additional physical his paper einstein used the additional principles that newtonian mechanics should hold for slow that there one energy scalar and one vector momentum slow and that the conservation law for energy and momentum exactly true furthermore assumed that the energy light transformed the same shift factor its which had previously shown true based the first papers this subject was does the inertia body depend upon its energy although argument this paper nearly universally accepted physicists even many authors over the years have suggested that other authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because relied some implicit einstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation his survey paper special there notes that problematic rely equations for the heuristic energy the argument his paper can carried out with the emission any massless but the maxwell equations are implicitly used make obvious that the emission light particular can achieved only doing emit electromagnetic all you have shake charged and this clearly doing that the emission how far can one travel from the space travel using constant acceleration since one can not travel faster than one might conclude that human can never travel further from earth than light years the traveler active between the age and one would easily think that traveler would never able reach more than the very few solar systems which exist within the limit light years from the but that would mistaken because time hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands light years during the active spaceship could built that accelerates constant will after little less than year traveling almost the speed light seen from time dilation will increase his life span seen from the reference system the but his lifespan measured clock traveling with him will not thereby during his people earth will experience more time than year round trip for him will take earth years and cover distance over light year round trip for him years decelerating twice will land him back earth having traveled for earth years and distance light full year trip will appear earth last years and cover distance light year trip will take earth years and cover about light way year years decelerating measured with the trip acceleration could reach light years the andromeda this same time dilation why muon traveling close observed travel much further than times its half life when causality and prohibition motion faster than light causality tachyonic antitelephone diagram the interval there frame reference which events and occur the same location separated only occurring different precedes that then precedes all hypothetically possible for matter travel from there can causal relationship with the cause and the the interval the diagram there frame reference which events and occur separated only there are also frames which precedes and frames which precedes were possible for effect relationship exist between events and then paradoxes causality would for was the and the then there would frames reference which the effect preceded the although this itself give rise one can show that faster than light signals can sent back into own causal paradox can then constructed sending the signal and only signal was received therefore causality one the consequences special relativity that information signal material object can travel faster than light however some things can still move faster than for the location where the beam search light hits the bottom cloud can move faster than light when the search light turned even without considerations there are other strong reasons why light travel forbidden special for constant force applied object for limitless amount then integrating gives momentum that grows without but this simply because approaches infinity approaches observer who not appears though the inertia produce smaller acceleration response the same this behavior observed particle accelerators where each charged particle accelerated the electromagnetic theoretical and experimental tunneling studies carried out nter nimtz and petrissa eckle claimed that under special conditions signals may travel faster than was measured that fiber digital signals were traveling times and time tunneling electron carried the information that the atom ionized with phonons and electrons spending zero time the tunneling according nimtz and this superluminal process only the einstein causality and the special relativity but not the primitive causality are superluminal propagation does not result any kind time several scientists have stated not only that interpretations were but also that the experiment actually provided trivial experimental confirmation the special relativity geometry spacetime minkowski space comparison between flat euclidean space and minkowski space line element euclidean space angle minkowski spacetime hyperbolic angle worldlines special relativity uses dimensional minkowski example spacetime minkowski spacetime appears very similar the standard dimensional euclidean space but there crucial difference with respect the differential distance line defined where are the differentials the three spatial minkowski there extra dimension with coordinate derived from such that the distance differential fulfills where are the differentials the four spacetime this suggests deep theoretical special relativity simply rotational symmetry our analogous the rotational symmetry euclidean space see image just euclidean space uses euclidean metric spacetime uses minkowski metric basically special relativity can stated the invariance any spacetime interval that the distance between any two when viewed from any inertial reference frame all equations and effects special relativity can derived from this rotational symmetry the poincar group minkowski the actual form above depends the metric and the choices for the coordinate make the time coordinate look like the space can treated imaginary ict this called wick rotation according misner thorne and wheeler ultimately the deeper understanding both special and general relativity will come from the study the minkowski metric described and take rather than disguised euclidean metric using ict the time some authors use with factors elsewhere for spatial coordinates are divided factors are included the metric these numerous conventions can superseded using natural units where then space and time have equivalent and factors appear spacetime reduce the spatial dimensions that can represent the physics space see that the null geodesics lie along cone see image defined the simply which the equation circle radius spacetime extend this three spatial the null geodesics are the dimensional this null cone represents the line point that when look the stars and say the light from that star which receiving years are looking down this line null are looking event distance away and time the for this reason the null dual cone also known the light the point the lower left the picture below represents the the origin represents the and the line represents the null geodesic line the cone the region the information that the point while the cone the section the information that the point the geometry minkowski space can depicted using minkowski diagrams which are useful also understanding many the experiments special note the concept the center mass becomes more see center mass physics spacetime transformations physical quantities between reference frames above the lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are this true more certain pairs timelike and spacelike quantities naturally combine equal footing under the same lorentz the lorentz transformation standard configuration for boost the direction can recast into matrix form newtonian quantities which have magnitude and direction are mathematically described vectors euclidean and general they are parametrized special this notion extended adding the appropriate timelike quantity spacelike vector and have four vectors minkowski the components vectors are written using tensor index notation this has numerous the notation makes clear the equations are manifestly covariant under the poincar group thus bypassing the tedious calculations check this constructing such often find that equations previously thought unrelated closely connected being part the same tensor recognizing other physical quantities tensors simplifies their transformation throughout upper indices are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate square this should clear from the and lower indices are covariant for simplicity and consistency with the earlier cartesian coordinates will the simplest example vector the position event which constitutes timelike component and spacelike component contravariant position four vector with where define that the time coordinate has the same dimension distance the other spatial that space and time are treated now the transformation the contravariant components the position vector can compactly written where there implied summation from and matrix more all contravariant components four vector transform from one frame another frame lorentz transformation examples other vectors include the four velocity defined the derivative the position vector with respect proper time where the lorentz factor the relativistic energy and relativistic momentum object are respectively the timelike and spacelike components covariant four momentum vector where the invariant mass the four acceleration the proper time derivative the transformation rules for three dimensional velocities and accelerations are very even above standard configuration the velocity equations are quite complicated owing their the other the transformation four velocity and four acceleration are simpler means the lorentz transformation the four gradient scalar field transforms covariantly rather than that only cartesian the covariant derivative which transforms manifest cartesian coordinates this happens reduce the partial but not other more the variant components vector transform according the inverse lorentz where the reciprocal matrix the postulates special relativity constrain the exact form the lorentz transformation matrices more most physical quantities are best described components tensors transform from one frame use the known tensor transformation law where the reciprocal matrix all tensors transform this example four dimensional second order antisymmetric tensor the relativistic angular momentum which has six three are the classical angular momentum and the other three are related the boost the center mass the the derivative the relativistic angular momentum with respect proper time the relativistic also second order antisymmetric tensor the electromagnetic field tensor another second order antisymmetric tensor field with six three for the electric field and another three for the magnetic field there also the stress energy tensor for the electromagnetic namely the electromagnetic energy tensor metric the metric tensor allows one define the inner product two which turn allows one assign magnitude the given the dimensional nature spacetime the minkowski metric has components valid any inertial reference frame which can arranged matrix which equal its those throughout use the signs different authors use different conventions see minkowski metric alternative the poincar group the most general group transformations which preserves the minkowski and this the physical symmetry underlying special the metric can used for raising and lowering indices vectors and invariants can constructed using the the inner product vector with another vector invariant means that takes the same value all inertial because scalar rank and appears its trivial the magnitude the vector the positive square root the inner product with one can extend this idea tensors higher for second order tensor can form the similarly for higher order invariant particularly inner products vectors with provide equations that are useful for because one need perform lorentz transformations determine the relativistic kinematics and invariance the coordinate differentials transform also the squared length the differential the position vector constructed using notice that when the line element negative that the differential proper time while when differential the proper distance the velocity has invariant which means all velocity vectors have magnitude this expression the fact that there such thing being coordinate rest the you are always moving forward through differentiating the above equation produces special the acceleration vector and the velocity vector are relativistic dynamics and invariance the invariant magnitude the momentum vector generates the energy momentum relation can work out what this invariant first arguing since matter which reference frame calculate and then transforming frame where the total momentum see that the rest energy independent rest energy can calculated even for particles and systems translating frame which momentum the rest energy related the mass according the celebrated equation discussed note that the mass systems measured their center momentum frame where total momentum given the total energy the system this may not equal the sum individual system masses measured other use newton third law motion both forces must defined the rate change momentum with respect the same time that requires the force defined unfortunately there tensor which contains the components the force vector among its particle not traveling one can transform the force from the moving reference frame into the reference this yields vector called the four force the rate change the above energy momentum four vector with respect proper the covariant version the force the rest frame the the time component the four force zero unless the invariant mass the object changing this requires closed system which mass being directly added removed from the which case the negative that rate change times though the components the four force are not equal the components the because the three force defined the rate change momentum with respect coordinate while the four force defined the rate change momentum with respect proper continuous the density force combines with the density power form covariant the spatial part the result dividing the force small cell the volume that the time component times the power transferred that cell divided the volume the this will used below the section relativity and unifying electromagnetism classical electromagnetism and special relativity covariant formulation classical electromagnetism theoretical investigation classical electromagnetism led the discovery wave equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed the and fields required certain behaviors charged the general study moving charges forms the wiechert potential which step towards special the lorentz transformation the electric field moving charge into moving reference frame results the appearance mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field conversely the magnetic field generated moving charge disappears and becomes purely electrostatic field comoving frame maxwell equations are thus simply empirical fit special relativistic effects classical model the electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent

criticism relativity theory special relativity its minkowski spacetime accurate only when the absolute value the gravitational potential much less than the region strong gravitational one must use general relativity general relativity becomes special relativity the limit weak very small such the planck length and quantum effects must taken into consideration resulting quantum gravity however macroscopic scales and the absence strong gravitational special relativity experimentally tested extremely high degree accuracy and thus accepted the physics experimental results which appear contradict are not reproducible and are thus widely believed due experimental special relativity mathematically and organic part all modern physical most notably quantum field theory string theory and general relativity the limiting case negligible gravitational newtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity small velocities compared the speed thus newtonian mechanics can considered special relativity slow moving see classical mechanics for more detailed several experiments predating paper are now interpreted evidence for these known einstein was aware the fizeau experiment before and historians have concluded that einstein was least aware the morley experiment early despite claims made his later years that played role his development the the fizeau experiment repeated michelson and morley measured the speed light moving with results that are consistent with relativistic addition colinear the famous michelson morley experiment gave further support the postulate that detecting absolute reference velocity was not should stated here contrary many alternative said little about the invariance the speed light with respect the source and both source and observer were travelling together the same velocity all the trouton noble experiment showed that the torque capacitor independent position and inertial reference the experiments rayleigh and brace showed that length contraction lead birefringence for moving accordance with the relativity particle accelerators routinely accelerate and measure the properties particles moving near the speed where
