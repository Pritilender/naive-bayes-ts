part religious practices and used for celestial navigation and many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed heavenly sphere and that they were astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them track the motions the planets and the inferred position the the motion the sun against the background stars and the was used create calendars which could used regulate agricultural the gregorian calendar currently used nearly everywhere the solar calendar based the angle the rotational axis relative its local the the oldest accurately dated star chart appeared ancient egyptian astronomy the earliest known star catalogues were compiled the ancient babylonian astronomers mesopotamia the late millennium during the kassite period the first star catalogue greek astronomy was created aristillus approximately with the help timocharis the star catalog hipparchus century included stars and was used assemble ptolemy star hipparchus known for the discovery the first recorded nova new many the constellations and star names use today derive from greek spite the apparent immutability the chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could they were the first observe and write about supernova now known the the brightest stellar event recorded history was the supernova which was observed and written about the egyptian astronomer ali ibn ridwan and several chinese the supernova which gave birth the crab nebula was also observed chinese and islamic medieval islamic astronomers gave arabic names many stars that are still used and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions the they built the first large observatory research mainly for the purpose producing zij star among the book fixed stars was written the persian astronomer abd rahman sufi who observed number star clusters including the omicron velorum and brocchi clusters and galaxies including the andromeda galaxy according zahoor the the persian polymath scholar abu rayhan biruni described the milky way galaxy multitude fragments having the properties nebulous stars and also gave the latitudes various stars during lunar eclipse according josep the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah proposed that the milky way was made many stars which almost touched one another and appeared continuous image due the effect refraction from sublunary citing his observation the conjunction jupiter and mars early european astronomers such tycho brahe identified new stars the night sky later termed novae suggesting that the heavens were not giordano bruno suggested that the stars were like the and may have other planets possibly even orbit around idea that had been suggested earlier the ancient greek philosophers democritus and epicurus and medieval islamic cosmologists such fakhr din razi the following the idea the stars being the same the sun was reaching consensus among explain why these stars exerted net gravitational pull the solar isaac newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed every idea prompted the theologian richard bentley the italian astronomer geminiano montanari recorded observing variations luminosity the star algol edmond halley published the first measurements the proper motion pair nearby fixed stars demonstrating that they had changed positions from the time the ancient greek astronomers ptolemy and hipparchus william herschel was the first astronomer attempt determine the distribution stars the during the performed series gauges directions and counted the stars observed along each line from this deduced that the number stars steadily increased toward one side the the direction the milky way core his son john herschel repeated this study the southern hemisphere and found corresponding increase the same addition his other william herschel also noted for his discovery that some stars not merely lie along the same line but are also physical companions that form binary star systems the science stellar spectroscopy was pioneered joseph von fraunhofer and angelo secchi comparing the spectra stars such sirius the they found differences the strength and number their absorption lines the dark lines stellar spectra due the absorption specific frequencies the secchi began classifying stars into spectral types however the modern version the stellar classification scheme was developed annie cannon during the alpha centauri saturn the first direct measurement the distance star cygni light years was made friedrich bessel using the parallax technique parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation the stars the observation double stars gained increasing importance during the friedrich bessel observed changes the proper motion the star and inferred hidden edward pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary when observed the periodic splitting the spectral lines the star mizar day detailed observations many binary star systems were collected astronomers such william struve and burnham allowing the masses stars determined from computation the orbital elements the first solution the problem deriving orbit binary stars from telescope observations was made felix savary the twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances the scientific study the photograph became valuable astronomical karl schwarzschild discovered that the color and hence its could determined comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude the development the photoelectric photometer allowed very precise measurements magnitude multiple wavelength albert michelson made the first measurements stellar diameter using interferometer the hooker telescope important theoretical work the physical structure stars occurred during the first decades the twentieth the hertzsprung russell diagram was propelling the astrophysical study successful models were developed explain the interiors stars and stellar cecilia gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily hydrogen and helium her phd the spectra stars were further understood through advances quantum physics this allowed the chemical composition the stellar atmosphere with the exception supernovae individual stars have primarily been observed our local group galaxies and especially the visible part the milky way demonstrated the detailed star catalogues available for our but some stars have been observed the galaxy the virgo cluster about million light years from the the local supercluster possible see star and current telescopes could principle observe faint individual stars the local cluster see cepheids however outside the local supercluster neither individual stars nor clusters stars have been the only exception faint image large star cluster containing hundreds thousands stars located distance one billion light years ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously designations star designation astronomical naming conventions star catalogue blue stragglers russell diagram the concept the constellation was known exist during the babylonian period ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements stars formed and they associated these with particular aspects nature their twelve these formations lay along the band the ecliptic and these became the basis astrology many the more prominent individual stars were also given particularly with arabic latin designations well certain constellations and the sun individual stars have their own myths the ancient greeks some stars known planets greek meaning wanderer represented various important from which the names the planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn were uranus and neptune were also greek and roman gods but neither planet was known antiquity because their low their names were assigned later circa the names the constellations were used name the stars the corresponding regions the the german astronomer johann bayer created series star maps and applied greek letters designations the stars each later numbering system based the right ascension was invented and added john flamsteed star catalogue his book historia coelestis the edition whereby this numbering system came called flamsteed designation flamsteed numbering the only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies the international astronomical union number private companies sell names which the british library calls unregulated commercial enterprise however the iau has disassociated itself from this commercial and these names are neither recognized the iau nor used one such star naming company the international star registry which during the was accused deceptive practice for making appear that the assigned name was official this discontinued isr practice was informally labeled scam and and the new york city department consumer affairs issued violation against isr for engaging deceptive trade units measurement although stellar parameters can expressed units cgs units often most convenient express luminosity and radii solar based the characteristics the solar mass solar luminosity watts solar radius large such the radius giant star the semi major axis binary star are often expressed terms the astronomical unit approximately the mean distance between the earth and the sun million million formation and evolution stellar evolution stars form within extended regions higher density the interstellar medium although the density still lower than the inside vacuum chamber these regions known molecular clouds consist mostly with about percent helium and few percent heavier one example such forming region the orion nebula massive stars form from molecular they powerfully illuminate those they also ionize the creating region all stars spend the majority their existence main sequence stars fueled primarily the nuclear fusion hydrogen into helium within their however stars different masses have markedly different properties various stages their the ultimate fate more massive stars differs from that less massive their luminosity and the impact they have their accordingly astronomers often group stars their very low mass stars with masses below solar masses not enter the asymptotic giant branch but evolve directly into white dwarfs low mass stars including the with mass above about and below about solar masses depending enter the where they develop degenerate helium core mass stars undergo helium fusion and develop degenerate oxygen massive stars have minimum mass solar but this may low solar these stars undergo carbon fusion with their lives ending collapse supernova explosion protostar formation star formation the formation star begins with gravitational instability within molecular caused regions higher density often triggered waves from nearby supernovae massive stellar the collision different molecular the collision galaxies starburst galaxy once region reaches sufficient density matter satisfy the criteria for jeans instability begins collapse under its own gravitational molecular cloud nasa image the cloud individual conglomerations dense dust and gas form bok globules globule collapses and the density the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature when the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition hydrostatic equilibrium protostar forms the these pre main sequence stars are often surrounded protoplanetary disk and powered mainly the release gravitational the period gravitational contraction lasts about million early stars less than solar masses are called tauri stars while those with greater mass are herbig stars these formed stars emit jets gas along their axis which may reduce the angular momentum the collapsing star and result small patches nebulosity known herbig haro objects these combination with radiation from nearby massive may help drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was early their tauri stars follow the hayashi track they contract and decrease luminosity while remaining roughly the same less massive tauri stars follow this track the main while more massive stars turn onto the henyey track main sequence main sequence stars spend about their existence fusing hydrogen into helium temperature and pressure reactions near the such stars are said the main sequence and are called dwarf starting age main the proportion helium core will steadily the rate nuclear fusion the core will slowly will the temperature and the for estimated have increased luminosity about since reached the main sequence billion years every star generates stellar wind particles that causes continual outflow gas into for most the mass lost the sun loses solar masses every about its total mass over its entire however very massive stars can lose solar masses each significantly affecting their stars that begin with more than solar masses can lose over half their total mass while the main hertzsprung russell diagram the duration that star spends the main sequence depends primarily the amount fuel has fuse and the rate which fuses that its initial mass and its for the its life estimated about billion years massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are low mass stars consume their fuel very stars less massive than solar called red dwarfs are able fuse nearly all their mass fuel while stars about solar mass can only use about their mass the combination their slow consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows stars about times the mass the sun last for about one trillion years according evolution while the massive fusing stars solar will last for about trillion the end their red dwarfs simply become dimmer and however since the lifespan such stars greater than the current age the universe billion stars under about solar masses are expected have moved off the main besides the elements heavier than helium can play significant role the evolution astronomers consider all elements heavier than helium metals and call the chemical concentration these elements the metallicity the metallicity can influence the duration that star will burn its control the formation magnetic fields and modify the strength the stellar older population stars have substantially less metallicity than the population stars due the composition the molecular clouds from which they over time these clouds become increasingly enriched heavier elements older stars die and shed portions their atmospheres post main sequence red giant stars least solar masses exhaust their supply hydrogen their their outer layers expand greatly and cool form red giant about billion when the sun enters this will expand maximum radius roughly astronomical unit million times its present the sun will lose roughly its current red giant solar hydrogen fusion proceeds shell surrounding the eventually the core compressed enough start helium fusion and the star now gradually shrinks radius and its surface temperature for larger the core region transitions directly from fusing hydrogen fusing after the star has consumed the helium the fusion continues shell around hot core carbon and the star then follows evolutionary path that parallels the original red giant but higher massive stars red supergiant during their burning very mass stars with more than nine solar masses expand form red supergiants once this fuel exhausted the they continue fuse elements heavier than the core contracts until the temperature and pressure suffice fuse carbon see carbon burning process this process with the successive stages being fueled neon see neon burning process oxygen see oxygen burning process and silicon see silicon burning process near the end the fusion continues along series layer shells within the each shell fuses different with the outermost shell fusing the next shell fusing and the final stage occurs when massive star begins producing iron since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier any fusion beyond iron does not produce net release the process the consume likewise since they are more tightly bound than all lighter energy cannot released fission relatively very massive large core inert iron will accumulate the center the the heavier elements these stars can work their way the forming evolved objects known wolf rayet stars that have dense stellar wind which sheds the outer collapse core the intensity radiation from that surface creating such radiation pressure the outer shell gas that will push those layers forming planetary nebula what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed less than solar shrinks relatively tiny object about the size known white dwarf white dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression take the electron degenerate matter inside white dwarf longer even though stars are generally referred being spheres eventually white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over very long period crab nebula supernova larger fusion continues until the iron core has grown large more than solar that can longer support its own this core will suddenly collapse its electrons are driven into its forming neutrinos and gamma rays burst electron capture and inverse beta decay the shockwave formed this sudden collapse causes the rest the star explode supernova supernovae become bright that they may briefly outshine the entire home when they occur within the milky supernovae have historically been observed eye observers new where none seemingly existed supernova explosions blow away most

solar black hole neutron star the matter state known neutron degenerate matter with more exotic form degenerate qcd matter possibly present the within black hole the matter state that not currently the off outer layers dying stars include heavy which may recycled during the formation new these heavy elements allow the formation rocky the outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind large stars play important part shaping the interstellar distribution white dwarf sirius nasa image addition isolated multi star system can consist two more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each the simplest and most common star system binary star but systems three more stars are also for reasons orbital such star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets binary larger groups called star clusters also these range from loose stellar associations with only few enormous globular clusters with hundreds thousands has been held assumption that the majority stars occur gravitationally multiple star this particularly true for very massive and class where the stars are believed part star however the proportion single star systems increases for smaller that only red dwarfs are known have stellar all stars are red most stars the milky way are likely single from stars are not spread uniformly across the but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and typical

take about years get distances like this are typical inside galactic discs including the vicinity the solar stars can much closer each other the centres galaxies and globular clusters much farther apart galactic halos due the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic collisions between stars are thought denser regions such the core globular clusters the galactic collisions can more such collisions can produce what are known blue stragglers these abnormal stars have higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity the characteristics sun earth almost everything about star determined its initial including essential characteristics such luminosity and well its lifespan and eventual age most stars are between billion and billion years some stars may even close billion years the observed age the universe the oldest star yet nicknamed methuselah estimated billion years due the uncertainty the this age for the star does not conflict with the age the determined the planck satellite the more massive the the shorter its primarily because massive stars have greater pressure their causing them burn hydrogen more the most massive stars last average few million while stars minimum mass red burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens hundreds billions chemical composition metallicity molecules stars from point the surface interior there are molecules roald hoffmann when stars form the present milky way galaxy they are composed about hydrogen and helium measured with small fraction heavier typically the portion
