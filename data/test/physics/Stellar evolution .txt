physics	stellar evolution navigation search play media subgiant giant planetary nebula stellar evolution the process which star undergoes sequence radical changes during its depending the mass the this lifetime ranges from only few million years for the most massive trillions years for the least which considerably longer than the age the universe the table shows the lifetimes stars function their all stars are born from collapsing clouds gas and often called nebulae molecular clouds over the course millions these protostars settle down into state becoming what known main sequence star nuclear fusion powers star for most its initially the energy generated the fusion hydrogen atoms the core the sequence later the preponderance atoms the core becomes helium stars like the sun begin fuse hydrogen along spherical shell surrounding the this process causes the star gradually grow passing through the subgiant stage until reaches the red giant phase stars with least half the mass the sun can also begin generate energy through the fusion helium their whereas more massive stars can fuse heavier elements along series concentric once star like the sun has exhausted its nuclear its core collapses into dense white dwarf and the outer layers are expelled planetary nebula stars with around ten more times the mass the sun can explode supernova their inert iron cores collapse into extremely dense neutron star black hole although the universe not old enough for any the smallest red dwarfs have reached the end their stellar models suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter before running out hydrogen fuel and becoming mass white stellar evolution not studied observing the life single most stellar changes occur too slowly even over many instead astrophysicists

roughly light years across and contain solar masses giant molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller each these the collapsing gas releases gravitational potential energy its temperature and pressure fragment condenses into rotating sphere superhot gas known protostar the further development heavily depends the mass the evolving the the protostar mass compared the mass the sun means solar protostars are encompassed and are thus more readily visible infrared wavelengths observations from the field infrared survey explorer wise have been especially important for unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their parent star clusters brown dwarfs and stellar objects protostars with masses less than roughly never reach temperatures high enough for nuclear fusion hydrogen these are known brown dwarfs the international astronomical union defines brown dwarfs stars massive enough fuse deuterium some point their lives jupiter masses solar objects smaller than jupiter masses are classified brown dwarfs but they orbit around another stellar object they are classified both deuterium burning and shine dimly and die away cooling gradually over hundreds millions hydrogen fusion sagittarius for more massive the core temperature will eventually reach million kelvin initiating the proton proton chain reaction and allowing hydrogen first deuterium and then helium stars slightly over the oxygen fusion reaction cno cycle contributes large portion the energy the onset nuclear fusion leads relatively quickly hydrostatic equilibrium which energy released the core exerts radiation balancing the weight the preventing further gravitational the star thus evolves rapidly stable beginning the main sequence phase its new star will sit specific point the main sequence the hertzsprung russell diagram with the sequence spectral type depending upon the mass the small relatively low mass red dwarfs fuse hydrogen slowly and will remain the main sequence for hundreds billions years whereas hot supergiants will leave the main sequence after just few million sized star like the sun will remain the main sequence for about billion the sun thought the middle its thus currently the main lbv yhg bsg rsg agb stars russell diagram main sequence fusion sun red giant asymptotic giant branch mature stars eventually the core exhausts its supply hydrogen and the star begins evolve off the main sequence without the outward pressure generated the fusion hydrogen counteract the force gravity the core contracts until either electron degeneracy becomes sufficient oppose gravity the core becomes hot enough around for helium fusion which these happens first depends upon the low mass stars what happens after mass star ceases produce energy through fusion has not been directly the universe thought around billion years which less time several orders some than takes for fusion cease such recent astrophysical models suggest that red dwarfs solar mass may stay the main sequence for some six twelve trillion gradually increasing both temperature and luminosity and take several hundred billion more slowly collapse into white dwarf such stars are fully convective and will not develop degenerate helium core with hydrogen burning least not until almost the whole star they ever expand into red slightly more massive stars expand into red giants but their helium cores are not massive enough ever reach the temperatures required for helium fusion they never reach the tip the red giant when hydrogen shell burning these stars move directly off the red giant branch like post agb but lower become white star about solar mass will able reach temperatures high enough fuse and these stars further stages evolution beyond the red giant mid sized stars main sequence stars mass red dwarf sized yellow dwarf massive eye nebula planetary nebula death star stars roughly solar masses become red giants which are large main sequence stars stellar classification red giants lie along the right edge the russell diagram due their red color and large examples include aldebaran the constellation taurus and arcturus the constellation tes red giants all have inert cores with burning concentric layers atop the core that are still fusing hydrogen into mid sized stars are red giants during two different phases their sequence red branch whose inert cores are made and branch whose inert cores are made asymptotic branch stars have burning shells inside the burning whereas branch stars have burning shells either the accelerated fusion the containing layer immediately over the core causes the star this lifts the outer layers away from the reducing the gravitational pull and they expand faster than the energy production this causes the outer layers the star which causes the star become redder than was the main red branch phase the branch phase life follows the main initially the cores branch stars the internal pressure the core insufficient balance this gravitational collapse releases heating concentric shells immediately outside the inert helium core that hydrogen fusion continues these the core branch star few solar masses stops collapsing when dense enough supported electron degeneracy pressure once this the core reaches hydrostatic the electron degeneracy pressure sufficient balance gravitational the gravity compresses the hydrogen the layer immediately above causing fuse faster than hydrogen would fuse sequence star the same this turn causes the star become more luminous from times and the degree expansion outstrips the increase causing the effective temperature the expanding outer layers the star are convective with the material being mixed turbulence from near the fusing regions the surface the for all but the mass the fused material has remained deep the stellar interior prior this the convecting envelope makes fusion products visible the surface for the first this stage the results are with the largest alterations the isotopes hydrogen and being the effects the cno cycle appear the with lower ratios and altered proportions carbon and these are detectable with spectroscopy and have been measured for many evolved the hydrogen around the core the core absorbs the resulting causing contract which turn causes the remaining hydrogen fuse even this eventually leads ignition helium fusion which includes the triple alpha process the stars more than approximately solar can take billion years more for the core reach helium ignition when the temperature and pressure the core become sufficient ignite helium helium flash will occur the core largely supported electron degeneracy pressure stars under solar more massive the ignition helium fusion occurs relatively even helium flash does the time very rapid energy release the order suns that the visible outer layers the star are relatively the energy released helium fusion causes the core that hydrogen fusion the overlying layers slows and total energy generation the star although not all the way the main and migrates the horizontal branch the russell gradually shrinking radius and increasing its surface core helium flash stars evolve the red end the horizontal branch but not migrate higher temperatures before they gain degenerate oxygen core and start helium shell these stars are often observed red clump stars the magnitude diagram hotter and less luminous than the red higher mass stars with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch higher some becoming unstable pulsating stars the yellow instability strip lyrae variables whereas some become even hotter and can form blue tail blue hook the horizontal the exact morphology the horizontal branch depends parameters such age and helium but the exact details are still being asymptotic branch phase after star has consumed the helium the fusion continues shell around hot core carbon and oxygen the star follows the asymptotic giant branch the russell paralleling the original red giant but with even faster energy generation which lasts for shorter although helium being burnt the majority the energy produced hydrogen burning shell closer the surface the helium from these hydrogen burning shells drops towards the center the star and periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases this known thermal pulse and they occur towards the end the branch sometimes even into the branch depending mass and there may several hundreds thermal there phase the ascent the branch where deep convective zone forms and can bring carbon from the core the this known the second dredge and some stars there may even third dredge this way carbon star very cool and strongly reddened stars showing strong carbon lines their process known hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and nitrogen before can dredged the and the interaction between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra carbon stars particular another well known class branch stars are the mira variables which pulsate with defined periods tens hundreds days and large amplitudes about magnitudes the total luminosity changes much smaller more massive stars the stars become more luminous and the pulsation period leading enhanced mass and the stars become heavily obscured visual these stars can observed stars pulsating the red and showing maser activity these stars are clearly oxygen contrast the carbon but both must produced dredge these range stars ultimately reach the tip the branch and run out fuel for shell they are not sufficiently massive start scale carbon they contract going through period branch superwind produce planetary nebula with extremely hot central the central star then cools white the expelled gas relatively rich heavy elements created within the star and may particularly oxygen carbon enriched depending the type the the gas builds expanding shell called circumstellar envelope and cools moves away from the allowing dust particles and molecules with the high infrared energy input from the central ideal conditions are formed these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation possible for thermal pulses produced once branch evolution has producing variety unusual and poorly understood stars known again branch these may result extreme horizontal branch stars subdwarf hydrogen deficient branch variable planetary nebula central and coronae borealis variables massive stars crab nebula massive the core already large enough the onset the hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has chance become thus when these stars expand and they not brighten much mass however they were much brighter than mass stars begin and are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less massive these stars are unlikely survive red supergiants instead they will destroy themselves type supernovas extremely massive stars more than approximately solar which are very luminous and thus have very rapid stellar lose mass rapidly due radiation pressure that they tend strip off their own envelopes before they can expand become red and thus retain extremely high surface temperatures and white from their sequence time the largest stars the current generation are about solar masses because the outer layers would expelled the extreme although mass stars normally not burn off their outer layers they can likewise avoid becoming red giants red supergiants they are binary systems close enough that the companion star strips off the envelope they rotate rapidly enough that convection extends all the way from the core the resulting the absence separate core and envelope due thorough the core grows hotter and denser gains material from fusion hydrogen the base the all massive electron degeneracy pressure insufficient halt collapse each major element consumed the progressively heavier elements temporarily halting the core the star not too massive less than approximately solar taking into account mass loss that has occurred this may then form white dwarf possibly surrounded planetary described above for less massive with the difference that the white dwarf composed chiefly neon and magnesium above certain mass estimated approximately solar masses and whose progenitor was around solar the core will reach the temperature approximately gigakelvins which neon partially breaks down form oxygen and the latter which immediately fuses with some the remaining neon form then oxygen fuses form sulfur silicon and smaller amounts other finally the temperature gets high enough that any nucleus can partially broken down most commonly releasing alpha particle helium which immediately fuses with another nucleus that several nuclei are effectively rearranged into smaller number heavier with net release energy because the addition fragments nuclei exceeds the energy required break them off the parent star with core mass too great form white dwarf but insufficient achieve sustained conversion neon oxygen and will undergo core collapse due electron capture before achieving fusion the heavier both heating and cooling caused electron capture onto minor constituent elements such aluminum and prior collapse may have significant impact total energy generation within the star shortly before this may produce noticeable effect the abundance elements and isotopes ejected the subsequent supernova supernova supernova once the nucleosynthesis process arrives iron the continuation this process consumes energy the addition fragments nuclei releases less energy than required break them off the parent the mass the core exceeds the chandrasekhar limit electron degeneracy pressure will unable support its weight against the force and the core will undergo catastrophic collapse form neutron star the case cores that exceed the tolman volkoff limit black hole through process that not completely some the gravitational potential energy released this core collapse converted into type type type supernova known that the core collapse produces massive surge neutrinos observed with supernova the extremely energetic neutrinos fragment some some their energy consumed releasing nucleons including neutrons and some their energy transformed into heat and kinetic energy thus augmenting the shock wave started rebound some the infalling material from the collapse the electron capture very dense parts the infalling matter may produce additional because some the rebounding matter bombarded the some its nuclei capture creating spectrum iron material including the radioactive elements and likely uranium although exploding red giants can produce significant quantities elements heavier than iron using neutrons released side reactions earlier nuclear reactions the abundance elements heavier than iron and certain isotopes elements that have multiple stable lived produced such reactions quite different from that produced neither abundance alone matches that found the solar system both supernovae and ejection elements from red giants are required explain the observed abundance heavy elements and isotopes there the energy transferred from collapse the core rebounding material not only generates heavy but provides for their acceleration well beyond escape velocity thus causing type type type note that current understanding this energy transfer still not although current computer models type type and type supernovae account for part the energy they are not able account for enough energy transfer produce the observed ejection some evidence gained from analysis the mass and orbital parameters binary neutron stars which require two such hints that the collapse magnesium core may produce supernova that differs observably ways other than from supernova produced the collapse iron the most massive stars that exist today may completely destroyed supernova with energy greatly exceeding its gravitational binding energy this rare caused pair instability leaves behind black hole the past history the some stars were even larger than the largest that exists and they would immediately collapse into black hole the end their due photodisintegration stellar remnants after star has burned out its fuel its remnants can take one three depending the mass during its white and black dwarfs white dwarf black dwarf for star solar the resulting white dwarf about solar compressed into approximately the volume the white dwarfs are stable because the inward pull gravity balanced the degeneracy pressure the consequence the pauli exclusion principle electron degeneracy pressure provides rather soft limit against further therefore for given chemical white dwarfs higher mass have smaller with fuel left the star radiates its remaining heat into space for billions white dwarf very hot when first more than the surface and even hotter its hot that lot its energy lost the form neutrinos for the first million years its but will have lost most its energy after billion the chemical composition the white dwarf depends upon its star few solar masses will ignite carbon fusion form neon and smaller amounts other resulting white dwarf composed chiefly neon and provided that can lose enough mass get below the chandrasekhar limit see and provided that the ignition carbon not violent blow the star apart star mass the order magnitude the sun will unable ignite carbon and will produce white dwarf composed chiefly carbon and and mass too low collapse unless matter added later see star less than about half the mass the sun will unable ignite helium fusion noted and will produce white dwarf composed chiefly the all that remains cold dark mass sometimes called black dwarf however the universe not old enough for any black dwarfs exist the white mass increases above the chandrasekhar limit which solar mass for white dwarf composed chiefly oxygen neon and then electron degeneracy pressure fails due electron capture and the star depending upon the chemical composition and collapse temperature the this will lead either collapse into neutron star runaway ignition carbon and heavier elements favor continued core because they require higher temperature because electron capture onto these elements and their fusion products higher core temperatures favor runaway nuclear which halts core collapse and leads type supernova these supernovae may many times brighter than the type supernova marking the death massive even though the latter has the greater total energy this inability collapse means that white dwarf more massive than approximately solar mass can exist with possible minor exception for very rapidly spinning white whose centrifugal force due rotation partially counteracts the weight their mass transfer binary system may cause initially stable white dwarf surpass the chandrasekhar white dwarf forms close binary system with another hydrogen from the larger companion may accrete around and onto white dwarf until gets hot enough fuse runaway reaction its although the white dwarf remains below the chandrasekhar such explosion termed nova neutron stars neutron star when stellar core the pressure causes electron thus converting the great majority the protons into neutrons the electromagnetic forces keeping separate nuclei apart are gone nuclei were the size dust atoms would large football and most the core the star becomes dense ball contiguous neutrons some ways like giant atomic with thin overlying layer degenerate matter chiefly iron unless matter different composition added the neutrons resist further compression the pauli exclusion way analogous electron degeneracy but these known neutron are extremely the order radius bigger than the size large and are phenomenally their period rotation shortens dramatically the stars shrink due conservation angular momentum observed rotational periods neutron stars range from about milliseconds over revolutions per several when these rapidly rotating magnetic poles are aligned with the detect pulse radiation each such neutron stars are called pulsars and were the first neutron stars though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars most often the form radio pulsars have also been detected and gamma ray black holes black hole the mass the stellar remnant high the neutron degeneracy pressure will insufficient prevent collapse below the schwarzschild radius the stellar remnant thus becomes black the mass which this occurs not known with but currently estimated between and solar black holes are predicted the theory general relativity according classical general matter information can flow from the interior black hole outside although quantum effects may allow deviations from this strict the existence black holes the universe well both theoretically and astronomical because the collapse supernova mechanism itself imperfectly still not known whether possible for star collapse directly black hole without producing visible whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then collapse into black the exact relation between the initial mass the star and the final remnant also not completely resolution these uncertainties requires the analysis more supernovae and supernova models stellar evolutionary model mathematical model that can used compute the evolutionary phases star from its formation until becomes the mass and chemical composition the star are used the and the luminosity and surface temperature are the only the model formulae are based upon the physical understanding the usually under the assumption hydrostatic extensive computer calculations are then run determine the changing state the star over yielding table data that can used determine the evolutionary track the
