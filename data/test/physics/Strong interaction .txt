the strong force nuclear strong force colour force one the four fundamental interactions the others being electromagnetism the weak interaction and gravitation effective only distance femtometre times stronger than million times stronger than the weak force interaction and many orders magnitude stronger than ensures the stability ordinary confining the elementary particles quarks into hadrons such the proton and neutron the largest components the mass ordinary furthermore most the mass energy common proton neutron the form the strong force field the individual quarks provide only about the energy proton citation needed the strong interaction observable two larger scale about femtometers the force that binds protons and neutrons together form the nucleus atom the smaller scale less than about the radius the force carried gluons that holds quarks together form neutrons and other hadron particles the strong force inherently has high strength that the energy object bound the strong force high enough produce new massive particles thus hadrons are struck energy they give rise new hadrons instead emitting freely moving radiation gluons this property the strong force called colour confinement and prevents the free emission strong instead jets massive particles are the context binding protons and neutrons together form the strong interaction called the nuclear force residual strong force this the residuum the strong interaction between the quarks that make the protons and the residual strong interaction obeys quite different dependent behavior between from when acting bind quarks within the binding energy related the residual strong force used nuclear power and nuclear weapons the strong interaction thought mediated massless particles called acting upon antiquarks and other gluons are thought interact with quarks and gluons because all carry type charge called colour colour charge analogous electromagnetic but comes three types rather than one red green blue and results different type with different rules these rules are detailed the theory quantum chromodynamics which the theory gluon just after the big bang when the universe was during the electroweak epoch the electroweak force separated from the strong although expected that grand unified theory exists describe such theory has been successfully and the unification remains outstanding unsolved problem physics contents history details behaviour the strong force residual strong force see also references further reading external links history before the physicists were uncertain about the binding mechanism the atomic was known that the nucleus was composed protons and neutrons and that protons possessed positive electric charge while neutrons were electrically however these facts seemed contradict one physical understanding that positive charges would repel one another and the nucleus should therefore fly however this was never new physics was needed explain this stronger attractive force was postulated explain how the atomic nucleus was bound together despite the mutual electromagnetic this hypothesized force was called the strong force which was believed fundamental force that acted the protons and neutrons that make the nucleus was later discovered that protons and neutrons were not fundamental but were made constituent particles called quarks the strong attraction between nucleons was the effect more fundamental force that bound the quarks together the protons and the theory quantum chromodynamics explains that quarks carry what called colour charge although has relation visible quarks with unlike colour charge attract one another result the strong interaction which mediated particles called gluons details the word strong used since the strong interaction the strongest the four fundamental its strength around times that the electromagnetic force some times great that the weak force and about times that gravitation behaviour the strong force the contemporary understanding strong force described quantum chromodynamics part the standard model particle mathematically qcd non abelian gauge theory based local symmetry group called quarks and gluons are the only fundamental particles that carry vanishing colour and hence participate strong the strong force itself acts directly only elementary quark and gluon all quarks and gluons qcd interact with each other through the strong the strength interaction parametrized the strong coupling constant this strength modified the gauge colour charge the group theoretical property the strong force acts between unlike all other forces weak and the strong force does not diminish strength with increasing after limiting distance about the size hadron has been remains strength about newtons matter how much farther the distance between the qcd this phenomenon called colour confinement implies that only not individual free can the explanation that the amount work done against force newtons about the weight metric ton mass the surface the enough create antiparticle pairs within very short distance simple the very energy applied pull two quarks apart will turn into new quarks that pair again with the original the failure all experiments that have searched for free quarks considered evidence for this the elementary quark and gluon particles affected are unobservable but instead emerge jets newly created whenever energy deposited into quark when quark proton struck very fast quark impacting during particle accelerator experiment however quark gluon plasmas have been citation needed every quark the universe does not attract every other quark the above distance independent since confinement implies that the strong force acts without diminishment only between pairs single and that collections bound quarks hadrons the net charge the quarks cancels seen from far collections quarks therefore appear without and the strong force therefore nearly absent between these hadrons between baryons however the cancellation not quite small residual force remains described known the residual strong force this residual force does diminish rapidly with and thus very range effectively few manifests force between the colourless hadrons and therefore sometimes known the strong nuclear force simply nuclear force residual strong force nuclear force pion this diagram click here the residual effect the strong force called the nuclear force the nuclear force acts between hadrons such mesons the nucleons atomic this residual strong acting transmits gluons that form part the virtual and rho mesons which transmit the nuclear force between the residual strong force thus minor residuum the strong force that binds quarks together into protons and this same force much weaker between neutrons and because mostly neutralized within them the same way that electromagnetic forces between neutral atoms van der waals forces are much weaker than the electromagnetic forces that hold the atoms internally unlike the strong force the nuclear force residual strong does diminish and fact diminishes rapidly with the decrease approximately negative exponential power though there simple expression known for see yukawa potential this together with the rapid decrease the disruptive electromagnetic force between protons with causes the instability larger atomic such all those with atomic numbers larger than the element lead see also nuclear binding energy colour charge coupling constant nuclear physics qcd matter quantum field theory and gauge theory standard model particle
