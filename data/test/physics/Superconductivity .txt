which superconductors are the most common response magnetic field superconductor can type meaning has single critical above which all superconductivity type meaning has two critical between which allows partial penetration the magnetic theory operation conventional can explained the bcs theory its unconventional otherwise critical temperature superconductor generally considered high temperature reaches superconducting state when cooled using liquid nitrogen that only low temperature more aggressive cooling techniques are required reach its critical material superconductor material classes include chemical elements mercury lead alloys such niobium titanium germanium niobium and niobium nitride ceramics ybco and magnesium diboride organic superconductors fullerenes and carbon nanotubes though perhaps these examples should included among the chemical they are composed entirely carbon elementary properties superconductors most the physical properties superconductors vary from material such the heat capacity and the critical critical and critical current density which superconductivity the other there class properties that are independent the underlying for all superconductors have exactly zero resistivity low applied currents when there magnetic field present the applied field does not exceed critical the existence these universal properties implies that superconductivity thermodynamic phase and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent microscopic zero electrical resistance cern lep lhc the simplest method measure the electrical resistance sample some material place electrical circuit series with current source and measure the resulting voltage across the the resistance the sample given ohm law the voltage this means that the resistance superconductors are also able maintain current with applied voltage property exploited superconducting electromagnets such those found mri machines experiments have demonstrated that currents superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable experimental evidence points current lifetime least years theoretical estimates for the lifetime persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime the universe depending the wire geometry and the normal electric current may visualized fluid electrons moving across heavy ionic lattice the electrons are constantly colliding with the ions the and during each collision some the energy carried the current absorbed the lattice and converted into heat which essentially the vibrational kinetic energy the lattice the energy carried the current constantly being this the phenomenon electrical the situation different conventional the electronic fluid cannot resolved into individual instead consists bound pairs electrons known cooper pairs this pairing caused attractive force between electrons from the exchange phonons due quantum mechanics the energy spectrum this cooper pair fluid possesses energy gap meaning there minimum amount energy that must supplied order excite the therefore larger than the thermal energy the given where boltzmann constant and the temperature the fluid will not scattered the the cooper pair fluid thus superfluid meaning can flow without energy class superconductors known type superconductors including all known high temperature superconductors extremely small amount resistivity appears temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when electric current applied conjunction with strong magnetic which may caused the electric this due the motion magnetic vortices the electronic which dissipates some the energy carried the the current sufficiently the vortices are and the resistivity the resistance due this effect tiny compared with that superconducting but must taken into account sensitive however the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting these vortices can become frozen into disordered but stationary phase known vortex below this vortex glass transition the resistance the material becomes truly superconducting phase transition superconducting the characteristics superconductivity appear when the temperature lowered below critical temperature the value this critical temperature varies from material conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around less than solid mercury for has critical temperature the highest critical temperature found for conventional superconductor for magnesium diboride mgb although this material displays enough exotic properties that there some doubt about classifying conventional superconductor cuprate superconductors can have much higher critical yba one the first cuprate superconductors has critical temperature and based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures excess the explanation for these high critical temperatures remains electron pairing due phonon exchanges explains superconductivity conventional but does not explain superconductivity the newer superconductors that have very high critical similarly fixed temperature below the critical superconducting materials cease superconduct when external magnetic field applied which greater than the critical magnetic field this because the gibbs free energy the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy the normal phase roughly independent the magnetic the material superconducts the absence then the superconducting phase free energy lower than that the normal phase and for some finite value the magnetic field proportional the square root the difference the free energies zero magnetic the two free energies will equal and phase transition the normal phase will more higher temperature and stronger magnetic field lead smaller fraction the electrons the superconducting band and consequently longer london penetration depth external magnetic fields and the penetration depth becomes infinite the phase the onset superconductivity accompanied abrupt changes various physical which the hallmark phase transition for the electronic heat capacity proportional the temperature the normal regime the superconducting suffers discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases low varies instead for some this exponential behavior one the pieces evidence for the existence the energy gap the order the superconducting phase transition was long matter experiments indicate that the transition meaning there latent heat however the presence external magnetic field there latent because the superconducting phase has lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal has been experimentally demonstrated that when the magnetic field increased beyond the critical the resulting phase transition leads decrease the temperature the superconducting calculations the suggested that may actually weakly order due the effect range fluctuations the electromagnetic the was shown theoretically with the help disorder field theory which the vortex lines the superconductor play major that the transition second order within the type regime and first order latent heat within the type regime and that the two regions are separated tricritical point the results were strongly supported monte carlo computer meissner effect meissner effect when superconductor placed weak external magnetic field and cooled below its transition the magnetic field the meissner effect does not cause the field completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only very small characterized called the london penetration depth decaying exponentially zero within the bulk the the meissner effect defining characteristic for most the london penetration depth the order the meissner effect sometimes confused with the kind diamagnetism one would expect perfect electrical according lenz law when changing magnetic field applied will induce electric current the conductor that creates opposing magnetic perfect arbitrarily large current can and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied the meissner effect distinct from the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition suppose have material its normal containing constant internal magnetic when the material cooled below the critical would observe the abrupt expulsion the internal magnetic which would not expect based the meissner effect was given phenomenological explanation the brothers fritz and heinz london who showed that the electromagnetic free energy superconductor minimized provided where the magnetic field and the london penetration this which known the london equation predicts that the magnetic field superconductor decays exponentially from whatever value possesses the superconductor with little magnetic field within said the meissner the meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field too superconductors can divided into two classes according how this breakdown type superconductors superconductivity abruptly destroyed when the strength the applied field rises above critical value depending the geometry the one may obtain intermediate state consisting baroque pattern regions normal material carrying magnetic field mixed with regions superconducting material containing type superconductors raising the applied field past critical value leads mixed state also known the vortex which increasing amount magnetic flux penetrates the but there remains resistance the flow electric current long the current not too second critical field strength superconductivity the mixed state actually caused vortices the electronic sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried these vortices quantized most pure elemental superconductors except niobium and carbon nanotubes are while almost all impure and compound superconductors are london moment conversely spinning superconductor generates magnetic precisely aligned with the spin the the london moment was put good use gravity this experiment measured the magnetic fields four superconducting gyroscopes determine their spin this was critical the experiment since one the few ways accurately determine the spin axis otherwise featureless history superconductivity history superconductivity superconductivity was discovered april heike kamerlingh onnes who was studying the resistance solid mercury cryogenic temperatures using the recently produced liquid helium refrigerant the temperature observed that the resistance abruptly the same also observed the superfluid transition helium without recognizing its the precise date and circumstances the discovery were only reconstructed century when notebook was subsequent superconductivity was observed several other lead was found superconduct and niobium nitride was found superconduct great efforts have been devoted finding out how and why superconductivity the important step occurred when meissner and ochsenfeld discovered that superconductors expelled applied magnetic phenomenon which has come known the meissner effect fritz and heinz london showed that the meissner effect was consequence the minimization the electromagnetic free energy carried superconducting london theory the first phenomenological theory superconductivity was london theory was put forward the brothers fritz and heinz london shortly after the discovery that magnetic fields are expelled from major triumph the equations this theory their ability explain the meissner effect wherein material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields crosses the superconducting using the london one can obtain the dependence the magnetic field inside the superconductor the distance the there are two london the first equation follows from newton second law for superconducting conventional theories during the theoretical condensed matter physicists arrived solid understanding conventional superconductivity through pair remarkable and important the phenomenological ginzburg landau theory and the microscopic bcs theory the phenomenological ginzburg landau theory superconductivity was devised landau and ginzburg this which combined theory order phase transitions with schr dinger like wave had great success explaining the macroscopic properties abrikosov showed that landau theory predicts the division superconductors into the two categories now referred and abrikosov and ginzburg were awarded the nobel prize for their work landau had received the nobel prize for other and died the dimensional extension the landau the coleman weinberg model important quantum field theory and cosmology also maxwell and reynolds found that the critical temperature superconductor depends the isotopic mass the constituent element this important discovery pointed the electron phonon interaction the microscopic mechanism responsible for the complete microscopic theory superconductivity was finally proposed bardeen cooper and schrieffer this bcs theory explained the superconducting current superfluid cooper pairs pairs electrons interacting through the exchange for this the authors were awarded the nobel prize the bcs theory was set firmer footing when bogolyubov showed that the bcs which had originally been derived from variational could obtained using canonical transformation the electronic hamiltonian lev kov showed that the bcs theory reduced the landau theory close the critical generalizations bcs theory for conventional superconductors form the basis for understanding the phenomenon superfluidity because they fall into the lambda transition universality the extent which such generalizations can applied unconventional superconductors still further history the first practical application superconductivity was developed with dudley allen buck invention the cryotron two superconductors with greatly different values critical magnetic

effect exploited superconducting devices such squids used the most accurate available measurements the magnetic flux quantum where the planck constant coupled with the quantum hall resistivity this leads precise measurement the planck josephson was awarded the nobel prize for this work was proposed that the same mechanism that produces superconductivity could produce superinsulator state some with almost infinite electrical resistance high temperature superconductivity high temperature superconductivity until physicists had believed that bcs theory forbade superconductivity temperatures above about that bednorz and ller discovered superconductivity lanthanum based cuprate perovskite material which had transition temperature nobel prize was soon found that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium making ybco raised the critical temperature this temperature jump particularly since allows liquid nitrogen replacing liquid helium this can important commercially because liquid nitrogen can produced relatively even avoiding some the problems such called solid plugs which arise when liquid helium used many other cuprate superconductors have since been and the theory superconductivity
