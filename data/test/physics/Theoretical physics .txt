mathematical beauty notion sometimes called occam razor after the century english philosopher william occam which the simpler two theories that describe the same matter just adequately preferred but conceptual simplicity may mean mathematical they are also more likely accepted they connect wide range testing the consequences theory part the scientific method physical theories can grouped into three mainstream theories proposed theories and fringe theories history history physics theoretical physics began least years under the pre socratic philosophy and continued plato and aristotle whose views held sway for during the rise medieval universities the only acknowledged intellectual disciplines were the seven liberal arts the trivium like grammar logic and rhetoric and the quadrivium like arithmetic geometry music and astronomy the concepts matter energy space time and causality slowly began acquire the form know other sciences spun off from the rubric natural philosophy during the middle ages and renaissance the concept experimental science the counterpoint began with scholars such ibn haytham and francis bacon the modern era theory began perhaps with the copernican paradigm shift astronomy soon followed johannes kepler expressions for planetary which summarized the meticulous observations tycho brahe the great push toward the modern concept explanation started with galileo one the few physicists who was both consummate theoretician and great experimentalist the analytic geometry and mechanics descartes were incorporated into the calculus and mechanics isaac newton another experimentalist the highest writing principia mathematica contained grand synthesis the work galileo and well theories mechanics and which held sway worldviews until the early joseph louis lagrange leonhard euler and william rowan hamilton would extend the theory classical mechanics each these individuals picked the interactive intertwining mathematics and physics begun two millennia earlier among the great conceptual achievements the and centuries were the consolidation the idea energy the inclusion heat then electricity and magnetism and light the laws thermodynamics and most importantly the introduction the singular concept entropy began provide macroscopic explanation for the properties statistical mechanics followed statistical emerged offshoot thermodynamics late the another important event the century was the discovery electromagnetic theory unifying the previously separate phenomena magnetism and the pillars modern physics and perhaps the most revolutionary theories the history have been relativity theory and quantum mechanics newtonian mechanics was subsumed under special relativity and gravity was given kinematic explanation general relativity quantum mechanics led understanding blackbody radiation which was original motivation for the and anomalies the specific heats solids and finally understanding the internal structures atoms and molecules quantum mechanics soon gave way the formulation quantum field theory begun the late the and saw the formulation the standard model particle physics using parallel applications relativity problems astronomy and cosmology all these achievements depended the theoretical physics moving force both suggest experiments and consolidate results often ingenious application existing the case descartes and newton with leibniz inventing new fourier studies heat conduction led new branch infinite orthogonal series modern theoretical physics attempts unify theories and explain phenomena further attempts understand the universe from the cosmological the elementary particle scale where experimentation cannot theoretical physics still tries advance through the use mathematical mainstream theories mainstream theories sometimes referred central theories are the body knowledge both factual and scientific views and possess usual scientific quality the tests consistency with existing established science and there exist mainstream theories that are generally accepted theories based solely upon their effects explaining wide variety although the explanation and possible composition are subjects examples black hole thermodynamics classical mechanics condensed matter physics conservation energy dark energy dark matter dynamics electromagnetism field theory fluid

quantum information theory quantum mechanics quantum gravity solid mechanics solid state physics condensed matter physics and the electronic structure materials special relativity standard model statistical mechanics thermodynamics proposed theories the proposed theories physics are usually relatively new theories which deal with the study physics which include scientific means for determining the validity models and new types reasoning used arrive the however some proposed theories include theories that have been around for decades and have eluded methods discovery and proposed theories can include fringe theories the process becoming established sometimes gaining wider proposed theories usually have not been examples causal sets dark energy einstein cosmological constant rosen bridge emergence grand unification theory loop quantum gravity theory string theory supersymmetry theory everything unparticle physics fringe theories fringe theories include any new area scientific endeavor the process becoming established and some proposed can include speculative this includes physics fields and physical theories presented accordance with known and body associated predictions have been made according that some fringe theories become widely accepted part other fringe theories end being some fringe theories are form protoscience and others are form pseudoscience the falsification the original theory sometimes leads reformulation the examples electrogravitics dynamic theory gravity luminiferous aether orgone thought experiments real experiments thought experiment thought experiments are situations created asking question akin suppose you are this assuming such what would they are usually created investigate phenomena that are not readily experienced day famous examples such thought experiments are schr cat the epr thought experiment simple illustrations time dilation and these usually lead real experiments designed verify that the conclusion and therefore the the thought experiments are the epr thought experiment led the bell inequalities which were then tested various degrees rigor leading the acceptance the current formulation quantum mechanics and probabilism working hypothesis see also physics experimental physics list theoretical physicists symmetry quantum mechanics timeline developments theoretical physics notes there some debate whether not theoretical physics uses mathematics build intuition and illustrativeness extract physical insight especially when normal experience fails rather than tool formalizing this links the question using mathematics less formally and more intuitive heuristic way say mathematical physics the work johann balmer and johannes rydberg and the semi empirical mass formula nuclear physics are good candidates for examples this the ptolemaic and copernican models the solar the bohr model hydrogen atoms and nuclear shell model are good candidates for examples this arguably these are the most celebrated theories newton theory einstein theory relativity and theory electromagnetism share some these this approach often favoured mathematicians and mathematical
