increase the efficiency and power output early steam engines particularly through the work french physicist nicolas onard sadi carnot who believed that the efficiency heat engines was the key that could help france win the napoleonic wars irish born british physicist lord kelvin was the first formulate concise definition thermodynamics dynamics the subject the relation heat forces acting

any reference atomic constitution foreign classical the qualified term statistical refers descriptions bodies and processes terms the atomic constitution mainly described sets items all have equal thermodynamics arose from the study two distinct kinds transfer heat and work and the relation those the macroscopic variables pressure and transfers matter are also studied thermodynamic equilibrium one the most important concepts for the temperature thermodynamic system well and perhaps the most characteristic quantity the systems and processes interest are taken further from thermodynamic their exact thermodynamical study becomes more relatively simple approximate however using the variables equilibrium are much practical many important practical heat engines the systems consist many subsystems different temperatures and engineering thermodynamic calculations deal effectively with such systems provided the equilibrium thermodynamic variables are nearly enough central thermodynamic analysis are the definitions the system which and its surroundings the surroundings thermodynamic system consist physical devices and other thermodynamic systems that can interact with example thermodynamic surrounding heat which held prescribed regardless how much heat might drawn from there are four fundamental kinds physical entities states walls thermodynamic processes and thermodynamic operations this allows two fundamental approaches thermodynamic that terms states and that terms cyclic processes thermodynamic system can defined terms its this thermodynamic system macroscopic physical explicitly specified terms macroscopic physical and chemical variables that describe its macroscopic the macroscopic state variables thermodynamics have been recognized the course empirical work physics and always associated with the material that constitutes its working are the walls that delimit the and connect with its the state variables chosen for the system should appropriate for the natures the walls and thermodynamic operation artificial physical manipulation that changes the definition system its usually change the permeability some other feature wall the that allows energy heat matter exchanged with the for the partition between two thermodynamic systems can removed produce single thermodynamic operation usually leads thermodynamic process transfer mass energy that changes the state the and the transfer occurs natural accord with the laws besides thermodynamic changes the surroundings can also initiate thermodynamic thermodynamic system can also defined terms the cyclic processes that can cyclic process cyclic sequence thermodynamic operations and processes that can repeated indefinitely often without changing the final state the for thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics apply physical necessary that its internal atomic mechanisms fall into one two those rapid the time frame the process the atomic states rapidly bring system its own state internal thermodynamic and those slow the time frame the process they leave the system the rapid atomic mechanisms account for the internal energy the they mediate the macroscopic changes that are interest for thermodynamics and statistical because they quickly bring the system near enough thermodynamic when intermediate rates are thermodynamics and statistical mechanics cannot such intermediate rate atomic processes not bring the system near enough thermodynamic equilibrium the time frame the macroscopic process this separation time scales atomic processes theme that recurs throughout the for classical thermodynamics characterized its study materials that have equations state characteristic equations they express equilibrium relations between macroscopic mechanical variables and temperature and internal they express the constitutive peculiarities the material the classical material can usually described function that makes pressure dependent volume and the resulting pressure being established much more rapidly than any imposed change volume the present article takes gradual approach the starting with focus cyclic processes and thermodynamic and then gradually beginning further consider equilibrium thermodynamic facts can often explained viewing macroscopic objects assemblies very many microscopic atomic objects that obey hamiltonian dynamics the microscopic atomic objects exist the objects each species being all because this statistical methods can used account for the macroscopic properties the thermodynamic system terms the properties the microscopic such explanation called statistical thermodynamics also often referred the term statistical mechanics though this term can have wider referring microscopic such economic that not obey hamiltonian history thermodynamicists rudolf clausius the mechanical theory heat statistical mechanics ludwig boltzmann willard gibbs the equilibrium heterogeneous substances chemical thermodynamics the history thermodynamics scientific discipline generally begins with otto von guericke who built and designed the first vacuum pump and demonstrated vacuum using his magdeburg hemispheres guericke was driven make vacuum order disprove aristotle held supposition that nature abhors shortly after the physicist and chemist robert boyle had learned designs coordination with scientist robert hooke built air using this boyle and hooke noticed correlation between pressure temperature and volume boyle law was stating that for gas constant its pressure and volume are inversely proportional based these associate named denis papin built steam digester which was closed vessel with tightly fitting lid that confined steam until high pressure was later designs implemented steam release valve that kept the machine from watching the valve rhythmically move and papin conceived the idea piston and cylinder did however follow through with his nevertheless based engineer thomas savery built the first followed thomas newcomen although these early engines were crude and they attracted the attention the leading scientists the the concepts heat capacity and latent heat which were necessary for development were developed professor joseph black the university where james watt worked instrument watt consulted with black tests his steam but was watt who conceived the idea the external condenser greatly raising the steam engine drawing all the previous work led sadi carnot the father publish reflections the motive power fire discourse power energy and engine the paper outlined the basic energetic relations between the carnot engine the carnot cycle and motive power marked the start thermodynamics modern the first thermodynamic textbook was written william rankine originally trained physicist and civil and mechanical engineering professor the university glasgow the first and second laws thermodynamics emerged simultaneously the primarily out the works william rankine rudolf clausius and william thomson lord the foundations statistical thermodynamics were set out physicists such james clerk maxwell ludwig boltzmann max planck rudolf clausius and willard gibbs from the american mathematical physicist josiah willard gibbs published series three the most famous being the equilibrium heterogeneous substances gibbs showed how thermodynamic processes including chemical reactions could graphically studying the energy entropy volume chemical potential temperature and pressure the thermodynamic system one can determine process would occur chemical thermodynamics was further developed pierre duhem gilbert lewis merle randall and guggenheim who applied the mathematical methods etymology the etymology thermodynamics has intricate was first spelled hyphenated form adjective thermo dynamic and from the hyphenated noun thermo dynamics represent the science heat and motive power and thereafter thermodynamics the components the word thermo dynamic are derived from the greek words therme meaning and dynamis meaning power haynie claims that the word was coined around the term thermo dynamic was first used january william thomson lord the phrase perfect dynamic engine describe carnot heat engine april thomson added appendix his paper and used the term thermodynamic the phrase the object thermodynamic engine pierre perrot claims that the term thermodynamics was coined james joule designate the science relations between heat and joule however never used that but did use the term perfect dynamic engine reference phraseology and note paper the engine thermo dynamics functional term denote the general study the action was first used william thomson his paper the dynamical theory heat the closed compound form thermodynamics was first used william rankine manual the steam engine chapter the principles branches description thermodynamic systems are theoretical constructions used model physical systems that exchange matter and energy terms the laws thermodynamics the study thermodynamical systems has developed into several related each using different fundamental model theoretical experimental applying the principles varying types classical thermodynamics classical thermodynamics accounts for the adventures thermodynamic system either its time invariant equilibrium else its continually repeated cyclic but formally not both the same uses only macroscopic quantities measureable the counting invariant term average such generated continually repetitive classical rates change are not admitted variables equilibrium state stands endlessly without change over while continually repeated cyclic process runs endlessly without net change the system over the account terms equilibrium states state thermodynamic equilibrium simple system spatially the classical account solely terms cyclic the spatial interior the working that process not the working thus does not have defined internal thermodynamic state its own because assumption made that should thermodynamic only its inputs and outputs energy heat and work are common describe cycle theoretically composed sequence very many thermodynamic operations and this creates link the description terms equilibrium the cycle then theoretically described continuous progression equilibrium classical thermodynamics was originally concerned with the transformation energy cyclic and the exchange energy between closed systems defined only their equilibrium the distinction between transfers energy heat and work was classical thermodynamics the distinction between heat and work became less this was because there was more interest open for which the distinction between heat and work not and beyond the scope the present alongside the amount heat transferred fundamental entropy was gradually found more generally applicable especially when considering chemical massieu considered entropy the basic dependent thermodynamic with energy potentials and the reciprocal the thermodynamic temperature fundamental independent massieu functions can useful day equilibrium the work josiah willard gibbs entropy was considered fundamental independent while internal energy was dependent all actual physical processes are some degree classical thermodynamics can consider irreversible but its account exact terms restricted variables that refer only initial and final states thermodynamic rates input and output that not change with for classical thermodynamics can consider average rates flows generated continually repeated irreversible cyclic also can consider irreversible changes between equilibrium states systems consisting several phases defined below this with removable replaceable but for systems that are described terms equilibrium considers neither nor spatial inhomogeneities simple systems with externally imposed force fields such the account terms equilibrium states descriptions irreversible processes refer only initial and final static equilibrium the time takes change thermodynamic state not local equilibrium thermodynamics local equilibrium thermodynamics concerned with the time courses and rates progress irreversible processes systems that are smoothly spatially admits time fundamental but only restricted rather than considering invariant flows average rates cyclic local equilibrium thermodynamics considers varying flows systems that are described states local thermodynamic equilibrium for processes that involve only suitably small and smooth spatial inhomogeneities and suitably small changes with good approximation can found through the assumption local thermodynamic within the large global region for suitably small local this approximation assumes that quantity known the entropy the small local region can defined particular that particular way definition entropy largely beyond the scope the present but here may said that entirely derived from the concepts classical neither flow rates nor changes over time are admitted into the definition the entropy the small local assumed without proof that the instantaneous global entropy equilibrium system can found adding the simultaneous instantaneous entropies its constituent small local local equilibrium thermodynamics considers processes that involve the dependent production entropy dissipative which kinetic energy bulk flow and chemical potential energy are converted into internal energy rates that are explicitly accounted time varying bulk flows and specific diffusional flows are but they are required dependent derived only from material properties described only static macroscopic equilibrium states small local the independent state variables small local region are only those classical generalized extended thermodynamics like local equilibrium generalized extended thermodynamics also concerned with the time courses and rates progress irreversible processes systems that are smoothly spatially describes varying flows terms states suitably small local regions within global region that smoothly spatially rather than considering flows invariant average rates cyclic its accounts generalized extended thermodynamics admits time fundamental quantity more reaching way than does local equilibrium the states small local regions are defined macroscopic quantities that are explicitly allowed vary with including varying generalized thermodynamics might tackle such problems ultrasound shock which there are strong spatial inhomogeneities and changes time fast enough outpace tendency towards local thermodynamic generalized extended thermodynamics diverse and developing rather than more less completed subject such classical for generalized extended the definition the quantity known the entropy small local region terms beyond those classical flow rates are admitted into the definition the entropy small local the independent state variables small local region include flow which are not admitted independent variables for the small local regions local equilibrium outside the range classical the definition the entropy small local region simple for thermodynamic account process terms the entropies small local the definition entropy should such ensure that the second law thermodynamics applies each small local often assumed without proof that the instantaneous global entropy equilibrium system can found adding the simultaneous instantaneous entropies its constituent small local for given physical the selection suitable independent local equilibrium macroscopic state variables for the construction thermodynamic description calls for qualitative physical rather than being simply mathematical problem concerned with uniquely determined thermodynamic suitable definition the entropy small local region depends the physically insightful and judicious selection the independent local equilibrium macroscopic state and different selections provide different generalized extended thermodynamical accounts one and the same given physical this one the several good reasons for considering entropy epistemic physical rather than simply material according respected there compelling reason believe that the classical thermodynamic entropy measurable property nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics statistical thermodynamics also called statistical emerged with the development atomic and molecular theories the second half the century and early provides explanation classical considers the microscopic interactions between individual particles and their collective terms classical quantum its explanation terms statistics that rest the fact the system composed several species particles collective the members each species respectively being some sense all thermodynamic equilibrium equilibrium thermodynamics studies transformations matter and energy systems near thermodynamic thermodynamic properties unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium macroscopic change occurring can within the every microscopic process balanced its this called the principle detailed central aim equilibrium thermodynamics given system defined initial subject specified calculate what the equilibrium state the system theoretical often convenient consider the simplest kind thermodynamic this defined variously different for the present the following definition abstracted from the definitions various region material with all intensive properties continuous space and time called simple system for the present article defined one that consists single phase pure chemical with interior within simple isolated thermodynamic system thermodynamic the absence externally imposed force all properties the material the system are spatially much the basic theory thermodynamics concerned with homogeneous systems thermodynamic most systems found nature considered engineering are not thermodynamic exactly they are changing can triggered change over and are continuously and discontinuously subject flux matter and energy and from other for according absolute thermodynamic equilibrium all radioactive materials would have decayed completely and nuclear reactions would have transmuted all nuclei the most stable such which would take cosmic times generally can such processes being many systems nature are close enough thermodynamic equilibrium that for many purposes their behaviour can well approximated equilibrium quasi static transfers between simple systems are nearly thermodynamic equilibrium and are reversible very much eases and simplifies theoretical thermodynamical studies imagine transfers energy and matter between two simple systems that proceed slowly that all times each simple system considered separately near enough thermodynamic such processes are sometimes called static and are near enough being natural processes are partly described tendency towards thermodynamic equilibrium and are irreversible not initially thermodynamic simple isolated thermodynamic time tend evolve naturally towards thermodynamic the absence externally imposed force they become homogeneous all their local such homogeneity important characteristic system thermodynamic equilibrium the absence externally imposed force many thermodynamic processes can modeled compound composite consisting several many contiguous component simple initially not thermodynamic but allowed transfer mass and energy between natural thermodynamic processes are described terms tendency towards thermodynamic equilibrium within simple systems and transfers between contiguous simple such natural processes are non equilibrium thermodynamics non equilibrium thermodynamics branch thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not thermodynamic equilibrium also called thermodynamics irreversible non equilibrium thermodynamics concerned with transport processes and with the rates chemical non equilibrium systems can stationary states that are not homogeneous even when there externally imposed field this the description the internal state the system requires field one the methods dealing with equilibrium systems introduce called internal these are quantities that express the local state the besides the usual local thermodynamic sense such variables might seen expressing the the hysteresis may sometimes described this contrast the usual thermodynamic internal cannot controlled external this approach usually unnecessary for gases and but may useful for many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope currently known macroscopic thermodynamic laws thermodynamics laws thermodynamics thermodynamics states set four laws that are valid for all systems that fall within the constraints implied the various theoretical descriptions thermodynamics these laws may expressed seemingly differing but the most prominent formulations are the zeroth law thermodynamics two systems are each thermal equilibrium with they are also thermal equilibrium with each this statement implies that thermal equilibrium equivalence relation the set thermodynamic systems under systems are said thermal equilibrium with each other spontaneous molecular thermal energy exchanges between them not lead net exchange this law tacitly assumed every measurement for two bodies known the same temperature deciding they are thermal equilibrium when put into thermal contact does not require actually bringing them into contact and measuring any changes their observable properties traditional the law provides empirical definition temperature and justification for the construction practical contrast absolute thermodynamic empirical temperatures are measured just the mechanical properties such their without reliance the concepts entropy the second third laws empirical temperatures lead calorimetry for heat transfer terms the mechanical properties without reliance mechanical concepts the physical content the zeroth law has long been for rankine defined temperature two portions matter are said have equal temperatures when neither tends communicate heat the maxwell stated law equal also all heat the same planck explicitly assumed and stated its customary day wording his formulation the first two the time the desire arose number the other three had already been assigned and was designated the zeroth law first law thermodynamics the increase internal energy closed system equal the difference the heat supplied the system and the work done the first law thermodynamics asserts the existence state variable for the internal and tells how changes thermodynamic the law allows given internal energy system reached any combination heat and important that internal energy variable state the system see thermodynamic state whereas heat and work are variables that describe processes changes the state the first law observes that the internal energy isolated system obeys the principle conservation energy which states that energy can transformed changed from one form but cannot created second law thermodynamics heat cannot spontaneously flow from colder location hotter the second law thermodynamics expression the universal principle dissipation kinetic and potential energy observable the second law observation the fact that over differences pressure and chemical potential tend even out physical system that isolated from the outside entropy measure how much this process has the entropy isolated system that not equilibrium tends increase over approaching maximum value classical the second law basic postulate applicable any system involving heat energy statistical the second law consequence the assumed randomness molecular there are many versions the second but they all have the same which explain the phenomenon irreversibility third law thermodynamics system approaches absolute zero the entropy the system approaches minimum the third law thermodynamics statistical law nature regarding entropy and the impossibility reaching absolute zero this law provides absolute reference point for the determination the entropy determined relative this point the absolute alternate definitions the third law the entropy all systems and all states system smallest absolute equivalently impossible reach the absolute zero temperature any finite number absolute zero degrees degrees system models and energy impermeable matter impermeable matter important concept thermodynamics the thermodynamic system precisely defined region the universe under everything the universe except the system known the surroundings system separated from the remainder the universe boundary which may merely notional and but convention delimits finite transfers work heat matter between the system and the surroundings take place across this the boundary may may not have properties that restrict what can transferred across system may have several distinct boundary sectors partitions separating from the each characterized how restricts and being permeable its characteristic transferred the volume can the region surrounding single atom resonating max planck defined citation needed can body steam air steam engine such sadi carnot defined can the body tropical cyclone such kerry emanuel theorized the field atmospheric thermodynamics could also just one nuclide system quarks hypothesized quantum thermodynamics anything that passes across the boundary needs accounted for proper transfer balance thermodynamics largely about such boundary sectors are various rigid flexible fixed moveable actually and fictive not actually for fixed boundary sector means the piston locked its then volume work done across that same moveable boundary allows the piston move and permitting volume there restrictive boundary sector for the whole earth including its and roughly volume work done the whole earth such system sometimes said diabatically heated cooled thermodynamics distinguishes classes systems their boundary open system has boundary sector that permeable such sector usually permeable also but the energy that passes cannot general uniquely sorted into heat and work open system boundaries may either actually else closed system has boundary sector that permeable but general its boundary permeable for closed boundaries are totally prohibitive matter adiabatically isolated system has only adiabatic boundary energy can transferred but transfers matter and energy heat are purely diathermically isolated system has only boundary sectors permeable only sometimes said adynamically isolated and closed matter process which work transferred sometimes called isolated system has only isolating boundary nothing can transferred into out engineering and natural processes are often described composites many different component simple sometimes with unchanging changing partitions between change partition example thermodynamic operation states and processes there are three fundamental kinds entity states processes and thermodynamic this allows three fundamental approaches thermodynamic that terms states thermodynamic equilibrium and that terms invariant processes and that terms cyclic processes the approach through states thermodynamic equilibrium system requires full account the state the system well notion process from one state another but may require only idealized partial account the state the surroundings the system other the method description terms states thermodynamic equilibrium has for processes region turbulent burning gas knudsen gas may beyond the province this problem can sometimes circumvented through the method description terms cyclic invariant flow this part the reason why the founders thermodynamics often preferred the cyclic process approaches through processes invariant flow system are used for some some for example joule thomson expansion are studied through flow but can accounted for distinguishing the steady bulk flow kinetic energy from the internal and thus can regarded within the scope classical thermodynamics defined terms equilibrium states cyclic other flow for example thermoelectric effects are essentially defined the presence differential flows diffusion that they cannot adequately accounted for terms equilibrium states classical cyclic the notion cyclic process does not require full account the state the but does require full account how the process occasions transfers matter and energy between the principal system which often called the working body and its which must include least two heat reservoirs different known and fixed one hotter than the principal system and the other colder than well reservoir that can receive energy from the system work and can work the the reservoirs can alternatively regarded auxiliary idealized component alongside the principal thus account terms cyclic processes requires least four contributory component the independent variables this account are the amounts energy that enter and leave the idealized auxiliary this kind the working body often regarded black and its own state not this the notion properly numerical scale empirical temperature presupposition not notion constructed derived from account terms states thermodynamic equilibrium when system thermodynamic equilibrium under given set conditions its said definite thermodynamic state which fully described its state system simple defined and thermodynamic and not subject externally imposed force such electricity then that spatially uniform all homogeneous system can regarded spatially because has spatial system thermodynamic equilibrium then its state can described few physical which are mostly classifiable intensive variables and extensive variables intensive variable one that unchanged with the thermodynamic operation scaling extensive variable one that simply scales with the scaling without the further requirement used just below additivity even when there inhomogeneity the added examples extensive thermodynamic variables are total mass and total under the above entropy also regarded extensive examples intensive thermodynamic variables are temperature pressure and chemical intensive thermodynamic variables are defined each spatial point and each instant time physical macroscopic variables can material temperature thermal according the most important conception thermodynamics intensive variables have the property that any number each its own separate homogeneous thermodynamic equilibrium all with the same respective values all their intensive regardless the values their extensive are laid contiguously with partition between form new then the values the intensive variables the new system are the same those the separate constituent such composite system homogeneous thermodynamic examples intensive variables are chemical pressure density density internal and when can properly density other intensive variables are not altered the thermodynamic operation for the immediately present account just alternative definition extensive variables that requires that any number regardless their possible separate thermodynamic equilibrium equilibrium states intensive are laid side side with partition between them form new then the values the extensive variables the new system are the sums the values the respective extensive variables the individual separate constituent obviously there reason expect such composite system homogeneous thermodynamic examples extensive variables this alternative definition are volume and internal they depend the total quantity mass the other although extensive variables scale with the system under the thermodynamic operation nevertheless the present alternative definition extensive variable requires more than requires also its additivity regardless the inhomogeneity equality inequality the values the intensive the component though when can properly density entropy intensive for inhomogeneous entropy itself does not fit into this alternative classification state the reason that entropy property system and not necessarily related simply its constituents true that for any number systems each its own separate homogeneous thermodynamic all with the same values intensive removal the partitions between the separate systems results composite homogeneous system thermodynamic with all the values its intensive variables the same those the constituent and reservedly conditionally true that the entropy such restrictively defined composite system the sum the entropies the constituent but the constituent systems not satisfy these restrictive the entropy composite system cannot expected the sum the entropies the constituent because the entropy property the composite system therefore though under these restrictive entropy satisfies some requirements for extensivity defined just entropy general does not fit the immediately present definition extensive being neither intensive variable nor extensive variable according the immediately present entropy thus out because state variable system equilibrium system can have very inhomogeneous dynamical this one reason for distinguishing the study equilibrium thermodynamics from the study equilibrium the physical reason for the existence extensive variables the invariance volume given inertial reference and the strictly local conservation momentum angular and noted entropy unlike energy and because not locally the out quantity entropy never conserved real physical all real physical processes are the motion planets seems reversible short time scale millions but their according newton laws mathematically example deterministic chaos eventually planet suffers unpredictable collision with object from its outer space this and consequently its future course radically theoretically this can expressed saying that every natural process dissipates some information from the predictable part its activity into the unpredictable the predictable part expressed the generalized mechanical and the unpredictable part other state variables can regarded conditionally subject reservation but not extensive defined examples are the gibbs free the helmholtz free and the consequently just because for some systems under particular conditions their surroundings such state variables are conditionally conjugate intensive such conjugacy does not make such state variables extensive defined this another reason for distinguishing the study equilibrium thermodynamics from the study equilibrium another way this explains why heat regarded quantity that refers process and not state system with internal and thermodynamic can inhomogeneous the following can consist several called each homogeneous immediate contiguity with other phases the but distinguishable their having various respectively different physical with discontinuity intensive variables the boundaries between the mixture different chemical species considered homogeneous for this purpose physically for vessel can contain system consisting water vapour overlying liquid then there vapour phase and liquid each homogeneous but still thermodynamic equilibrium with the other for the immediately present systems with multiple phases are not though for many thermodynamic multiphase systems are equation state the macroscopic variables thermodynamic system thermodynamic which temperature well can related one another through equations state characteristic they express the constitutive peculiarities the material the the equation state must comply with some thermodynamic but cannot derived from the general principles thermodynamics thermodynamic processes between states thermodynamic equilibrium thermodynamic process defined changes state internal the system combined with transfers matter and energy and from the surroundings the system and from other system demarcated from its surroundings from other systems partitions that more less separate and may move piston change the volume the system and thus transfer dependent and independent variables for process process described changes values state variables systems quantities exchange matter and energy between systems and the change must specified terms prescribed the choice which variables are used made advance consideration the course the and cannot certain the variables chosen advance are called the independent from changes independent variables may derived changes other variables called dependent for example process may occur constant pressure with pressure prescribed independent and temperature changed another independent and then changes volume are considered careful attention this principle necessary changes state system the approach through equilibrium states the process can described two main one the system considered connected the surroundings some kind more less separating and allowed reach equilibrium with the surroundings with that partition then while the separative character the partition kept the conditions the surroundings are and exert their influence the system again through the separating the partition moved change the volume the and new equilibrium for system allowed reach equilibrium with heat bath one then the temperature the heat bath changed and the system allowed reach new the partition allows conduction the new equilibrium different from the old the other several systems are connected one another various kinds more less separating and reach equilibrium with each with those partitions this one may speak compound then one more partitions removed changed its separative properties and new equilibrium the thomson experiment example tube gas separated from another tube porous the volume available each the tubes determined respective equilibrium established with initial set the volumes are changed and new equilibrium another example separation and mixing with use chemically permeable commonly considered thermodynamic processes often convenient study thermodynamic process which single such pressure etc held furthermore useful group these processes into which each variable held constant one member conjugate pair several commonly studied thermodynamic processes isobaric process occurs constant pressure isochoric process occurs constant volume also called isothermal process occurs constant temperature adiabatic process occurs without loss gain energy heat isentropic process reversible adiabatic process occurs constant entropy but fictional conceptually possible actually physically conduct process that keeps the entropy the system allowing systematically controlled removal conduction cooler compensate for entropy produced within the system irreversible work done the such isentropic conduct process seems called for when the entropy the system considered independent for example when the internal energy considered function the entropy and volume the the natural variables the internal energy studied gibbs isenthalpic process occurs constant enthalpy isolated process matter energy neither work nor transferred into out the system sometimes interest study process which several variables are subject some specified system which chemical reaction can for which the pressure and temperature can affect the equilibrium process might occur which temperature held constant but pressure slowly just that chemical equilibrium maintained all the there corresponding process constant temperature which the final pressure the same but reached rapid then can shown that the volume change resulting from the rapid jump process smaller than that from the slow equilibrium the work transferred differs between the two account terms cyclic processes cyclic process process that can repeated indefinitely often without changing the final state the system which the process the only traces the effects cyclic process are found the surroundings the system other this the kind process that concerned early thermodynamicists such carnot and terms which kelvin defined absolute before the use the quantity entropy rankine and its clear identification clausius for some for example with some plastic working cyclic processes are practically nearly unfeasible because the working substance undergoes practically irreversible this why mechanical devices are lubricated with oil and one the reasons why electrical devices are often cyclic process system requires its surroundings least two heat reservoirs different one higher temperature that supplies heat the the other lower temperature that accepts heat from the the early work thermodynamics tended use the cyclic process because was interested machines that converted some the heat from the surroundings into mechanical power delivered the without too much concern about the internal workings the such while receiving amount heat from higher temperature always needs lower temperature reservoir that accepts some lesser amount the difference amounts heat equal the amount heat converted later the internal workings system became and they are described the states the nowadays instead arguing terms cyclic some writers are inclined derive the concept absolute temperature from the concept variable instrumentation there are two types thermodynamic instruments the meter and the reservoir thermodynamic meter any device that measures any parameter thermodynamic system some the thermodynamic parameter actually defined terms idealized measuring for the zeroth law states that two bodies are thermal equilibrium with third they are also thermal equilibrium with each this noted james maxwell asserts that possible measure idealized thermometer sample ideal gas constant from the ideal gas law nrt the volume such sample can used indicator this manner defines although pressure defined measuring called barometer may also constructed from sample ideal gas held constant calorimeter device that measures and define the internal energy thermodynamic reservoir system large that does not appreciably alter its state parameters when brought into contact with the test used impose particular value state parameter upon the for pressure reservoir system particular which imposes that pressure upon any test system that mechanically connected the atmosphere often used pressure conjugate variables conjugate variables central concept thermodynamics that energy the first law the total energy system and its surroundings energy may transferred into system compression addition and extracted from system expansion extraction mechanics for energy transfer equals the product the force applied body and the resulting conjugate variables are pairs thermodynamic with the first being akin force applied some thermodynamic system the second being akin the resulting and the product the two equalling the amount energy the common conjugate variables pressure volume the mechanical parameters temperature entropy thermal chemical potential particle number material potentials thermodynamic potentials are different quantitative measures the stored energy potentials are used measure energy changes systems they evolve from initial state final the potential used depends the constraints the such constant temperature for the helmholtz and gibbs energies are the energies available system useful work when the temperature and volume the pressure and temperature are respectively the five most well known potentials internal energy helmholtz free energy enthalpy gibbs free energy landau potential grand where the temperature the entropy the pressure the volume the chemical potential the number particles the and the count particles types the thermodynamic potentials can derived from the energy balance equation applied thermodynamic other thermodynamic potentials can also obtained through legendre transformation axiomatics most accounts thermodynamics presuppose the law conservation mass sometimes and sometimes explicit particular attention paid the law accounts equilibrium one statement this law the total mass closed system remains another statement chemical matter neither created nor implied this that matter and energy are not considered interconverted such the full generality the law conservation energy thus not used such constantin odory presented purely mathematical axiomatic description often referred geometrical thermodynamics and sometimes said take the mechanical the odory formulation restricted equilibrium thermodynamics and does not attempt deal with non equilibrium thermodynamics forces that act distance the surface tension moreover carath formulation does not deal with materials like water near which have density extremum function temperature constant carath odory used the law conservation energy axiom from along with the contents the zeroth and some other assumptions including his own version the second derived the first law consequently one might also describe work lying the field energetics which broader than carath odory presupposed the law conservation mass without explicit mention since the time other influential axiomatic formulations thermodynamics have which like use their own respective different from the usual statements the four derive the four usually stated many axiomatic developments assume the existence states thermodynamic equilibrium and states thermal states thermodynamic equilibrium compound systems allow their component simple systems exchange heat and matter and work each other their way overall joint thermal equilibrium allows them only exchange the physical properties glass depend its history being heated and cooled strictly glass not thermodynamic according herbert callen widely cited text essential prerequisite for the measurability energy the existence walls that not permit transfer energy the form according werner heisenberg mature and careful examination the basic concepts the theory heat has standing from the viewpoint the there are several different ways thinking about temperature and the second law the clausius way rests the empirical fact that heat conducted always never temperature the kelvin way assert the empirical fact that conversion heat into work cyclic processes never perfectly more mathematical way assert the existence function state called the entropy that tells whether hypothesized process occurs spontaneously more abstract way that odory that effect asserts the irreversibility some adiabatic for these different there are respective corresponding different ways viewing heat and the planck way this way prefers ideas close the empirical origins presupposes transfer energy and empirical temperature scalar function according gislason and craig most thermodynamic data come from according kondepudi calorimetry widely used present day this what often currently called the zeroth law thermodynamics deduced simple consequence the presupposition the nature heat and empirical but not named numbered law planck attributed this point view kelvin and planck wrote page the seventh dated his that thought that proof the second law thermodynamics could ever work that was not based the impossibility perpetual motion machine the second that planck makes mention the carath odory which was well known planck for himself chose version what just above called the kelvin the development truesdell and bharatha constructed that can deal naturally with cases like that water near the way that assumes the existence entropy function state this way also presupposes transfer energy and presupposes the usually stated form the zeroth law and from these two deduces the existence empirical then from the existence entropy deduces the existence absolute thermodynamic the odory way this way presupposes that the state simple phase system fully specifiable just one more state variable than the known exhaustive list mechanical variables does not explicitly name empirical but speaks the dimensional deformation this satisfies the definition empirical that lies dimensional the odory way needs assume moreover that the dimensional manifold has definite which determines the direction irreversible adiabatic which effectively assuming that heat conducted from hot this way presupposes the often currently stated version the zeroth but does not actually name one its according one carath which his version the second law does not imply the increase entropy when work done under adiabatic conditions was noted planck thus way leaves unstated further empirical fact that needed for full expression the second law scope thermodynamics originally thermodynamics concerned material and radiative phenomena that are experimentally for state thermodynamic equilibrium steady state reached after system has aged that longer changes with the passage but more than for defined its being prepared certain way consequent every particular occasion upon reach one and the same eventual state thermodynamic entirely determined the way such reproducibility because the systems consist many molecules that the molecular variations between particular occasions preparation have negligible scarcely discernable effects the macroscopic variables that are used thermodynamic this led discovery that entropy had statistical probabilistic probabilistic and statistical explanations arise from the experimental reproducibility the gradually the laws thermodynamics came used explain phenomena that occur outside the experimental for phenomena the scale the atmosphere cannot reproduced laboratory but processes the atmosphere can modeled use thermodynamic extended well beyond the scope laboratory equilibrium parcel air near enough for many considered closed thermodynamic one that allowed move over significant the pressure exerted the surrounding air the lower face parcel air may differ from that its upper this results rising the parcel can considered have gained potential energy result work being done the combined surrounding air below and above such parcel usually expands because the pressure lower the higher altitudes that that the rising parcel also does work the surrounding for many such parcel can considered nearly neither gain nor lose energy heat conduction its surrounding and its rise rapid enough leave negligible time for gain lose heat consequently the rising the parcel near enough thus the adiabatic gas law accounts for its internal state provided that there precipitation into water evaporation water and sublimation the more the rising the parcel likely occasion friction and that some potential and some kinetic energy bulk converts into internal energy air considered effectively friction and turbulence thus oppose the rising the applied fields atmospheric thermodynamics biological thermodynamics
