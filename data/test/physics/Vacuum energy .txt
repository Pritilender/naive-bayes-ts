able help recruit november vacuum energy underlying background energy that exists space throughout the entire universe one contribution the vacuum energy may from virtual particles which are thought particle pairs that blink into existence and then annihilate timespan too short they are expected this throughout the their behavior codified energy time uncertainty principle still the exact effect such fleeting bits energy difficult the effects vacuum energy can experimentally observed various phenomena such spontaneous emission the casimir effect and the lamb shift and are thought influence the behavior the universe cosmological scales using the upper limit the cosmological constant the vacuum energy cubic meter free space has been estimated joules ergs however both quantum electrodynamics and stochastic electrodynamics consistency with the principle lorentz covariance and with the magnitude the planck constant requires have much larger value joules per cubic this huge discrepancy known the vacuum catastrophe contents origin implications history see also external articles and references notes origin quantum field theory states that all fundamental fields such the electromagnetic field must quantized each and every point field physics may envisioned space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and and the strength the field were like the displacement ball from its rest the theory requires vibrations more accurately changes the strength such field propagate per the appropriate wave equation for the particular field the second quantization quantum field theory requires that each such spring combination that that the strength the field quantized each point canonically the field each point space simple harmonic oscillator its quantization places quantum harmonic oscillator each excitations the field correspond the elementary particles particle physics thus according the even the vacuum has vastly complex structure and all calculations quantum field theory must made relation this model the the theory considers vacuum implicitly have the same properties such spin polarization the case light energy and according the most these properties cancel out average leaving the vacuum empty the literal sense the one important however the vacuum energy the vacuum expectation value the the quantization simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible zero point energy such oscillator summing over all possible oscillators all points space gives infinite remove this one may argue that only differences energy are physically much the concept potential energy has been treated classical mechanics for this argument the underpinning the theory renormalization all practical this how the infinity vacuum energy can also thought terms virtual particles also known vacuum which are created and destroyed out the these particles are always created out the vacuum antiparticle pairs which most cases shortly annihilate each other and however these particles and antiparticles may interact with others before process which can mapped using feynman diagrams note that this method computing vacuum energy mathematically equivalent having quantum harmonic oscillator each point therefore suffers the same renormalization additional contributions the vacuum energy come from spontaneous symmetry breaking quantum field theory implications vacuum energy has number dutch physicists hendrik casimir and dirk polder predicted the existence tiny attractive force between closely placed metal plates due resonances the vacuum energy the space between this now known the casimir effect and has since been extensively experimentally therefore believed that the vacuum energy real the same sense that more familiar conceptual objects such magnetic etc are however alternate explanations for the casimir effect have since been other predictions are harder vacuum fluctuations are always created antiparticle the creation these virtual particles near the event horizon black hole has been hypothesized physicist stephen hawking mechanism for the eventual evaporation black holes the net energy the universe remains zero long the particle pairs annihilate each other within planck time one the pair pulled into the black hole before then the other particle becomes real and mass essentially radiated into space from the black this loss cumulative and could result the black disappearance over the time required dependent the mass the black hole but could the order years for large mass black the vacuum energy also has important consequences for physical cosmology special relativity predicts that energy equivalent and the vacuum energy really should exert gravitational force essentially zero vacuum energy expected contribute the cosmological constant which affects the expansion the universe the special case vacuum general relativity stipulates that the gravitational field proportional where the energy and the quantum theory the vacuum further stipulates that the pressure the state vacuum energy always negative and equal magnitude thus the total negative this calculation implies repulsive gravitational giving rise acceleration the expansion the universe indeed the vacuum ground state has zero however the vacuum energy mathematically infinite without renormalization which based the assumption that can only measure energy relative which not true can observe indirectly via the cosmological constant the existence vacuum energy also sometimes used theoretical justification for the possibility energy has been argued that due the broken symmetry free energy does not violate conservation since the laws thermodynamics only apply equilibrium however consensus amongst physicists that this incorrect and that vacuum energy cannot harnessed generate free not citation given the second law thermodynamics unaffected the existence vacuum citation needed however stochastic electrodynamics the energy density taken classical random noise wave field which consists real electromagnetic noise waves propagating isotropically all the energy such wave field would seem with nothing more complicated than directional coupler the most obvious difficulty appears the spectral distribution the which compatibility with lorentz invariance requires take the form where constant and denotes follows that the energy and momentum flux this wave field only becomes significant extremely short wavelengths where directional coupler technology currently history georges tre used unusual perfect fluid equation state interpret the cosmological constant due vacuum the casimir effect provided the first experimental verification the existence vacuum lee and yang proved the concepts broken symmetry and parity violation for which they won the nobel edward tryon proposed the zero energy universe hypothesis that the universe may scale mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive mass energy balanced negative gravitational potential energy during the there were many attempts relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy specific fields that were predicted attempts grand unification theory and use observations the universe confirm one another however the exact nature the particles that generate vacuum with density such that required inflation remains see also casimir effect cosmological
