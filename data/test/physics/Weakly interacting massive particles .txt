physics	weakly interacting massive particles weakly interacting massive particle navigation search particle physics and astrophysics weakly interacting massive particles wimps are among the leading hypothetical particle physics candidates for dark matter the term given dark matter particle that was produced falling out thermal equilibrium with the hot dense plasma the early although often used refer any dark matter candidate that interacts with standard particles via force similar strength the weak nuclear force its name comes from the fact that obtaining the correct abundance dark matter today via thermal production requires annihilation cross section which roughly what expected for new particle the gev mass range which interacts via the electroweak force this apparent coincidence known the wimp since supersymmetric extensions the standard model particle physics readily predict new particle with these stable supersymmetric partner has long been prime wimp however recent null results from direct detection experiments including lux and supercdms along with the failure produce evidence supersymmetry the large hadron collider experiment has cast doubt the simplest wimp experimental efforts detect wimps include the search for products wimp including gamma rays neutrinos and cosmic rays nearby galaxies and galaxy direct detection experiments designed measure the

help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and january wimp like particles are predicted parity conserving supersymmetry popular type extension the standard model particle although none the large number new particles supersymmetry have been the main theoretical characteristics wimp interactions only through the weak nuclear force and gravity possibly other interactions with cross sections higher than the weak large mass compared standard particles wimps with gev masses may considered light dark matter because their lack electromagnetic interaction with normal wimps would dark and invisible through normal electromagnetic because their large they would relatively slow moving and therefore cold their relatively low velocities would insufficient overcome the mutual gravitational and result wimps would tend clump wimps are considered one the main candidates for cold dark matter the others being massive compact halo objects and axions these names were deliberately chosen for with machos named later than also contrast there are known stable particles within the standard model particle physics that have all the properties the particles that have little interaction with normal such neutrinos are all very and hence would fast hot wimps dark matter although the existence wimps nature hypothetical this would resolve number astrophysical and cosmological problems related dark there near consensus today among astronomers that most the mass the universe simulations universe full cold dark matter produce galaxy distributions that are roughly similar that which contrast hot dark matter would smear out the scale structure galaxies and thus not considered viable cosmological the wimp fits the model relic dark matter particle from the early when all particles were state thermal equilibrium for sufficiently high such existed the early the dark matter particle and its antiparticle would have been both forming from and annihilating into lighter the universe expanded and the average thermal energy these lighter particles decreased and eventually became insufficient form dark matter antiparticle the annihilation the dark matter antiparticle however would have and the number density dark matter particles would have begun decrease eventually however the number density would become low that the dark matter particle and antiparticle interaction would and the number dark matter particles would remain constant the universe continued particles with larger interaction cross section would continue annihilate for longer period and thus would have smaller number density when the annihilation interaction based the current estimated abundance dark matter the the dark matter particle such relic the interaction cross section governing the antiparticle annihilation can larger than the cross section for the weak this model the dark matter particle would have the properties the experimental detection because wimps may only interact through gravitational and weak they are extremely difficult however there are many experiments underway attempt detect wimps both directly and direct detection refers the observation the effects nucleus collision the dark matter passes through detector earth indirect detection refers the observation annihilation decay products wimps far away from indirect detection efforts typically focus locations where wimp dark matter thought accumulate the the centers galaxies and galaxy well the smaller satellite galaxies the milky these are particularly useful since they tend contain very little baryonic reducing the expected background from standard astrophysical typical indirect searches look for excess gamma rays which are predicted both state products are produced charged particles interact with ambient radiation via inverse compton scattering the spectrum and intensity gamma ray signal depends the annihilation and must computed model experiments which have placed bounds wimp via the observation annihilation include the fermi lat gamma ray telescope and the veritas based gamma ray although the annihilation wimps into standard model particles also predicts the production energy their interaction rate too low reliably detect dark matter signal future observations from the icecube observatory antarctica may able differentiate produced neutrinos from standard astrophysical however only cosmological neutrinos have been making such distinction another type indirect wimp signal could come from the halo wimps they pass through the interact with solar helium nuclei well heavier wimp loses enough energy such interaction fall below the local escape velocity would not have enough energy escape the gravitational pull the sun and would remain gravitationally more and more wimps thermalize inside the they begin annihilate with each forming variety particles including energy neutrinos these neutrinos may then travel the earth detected one the many neutrino such the super kamiokande detector the number neutrino events detected per day these detectors depends upon the properties the well the mass the higgs boson similar experiments are underway detect neutrinos from wimp annihilations within the earth and from within the galactic while most wimp models indicate that large enough number wimps must captured large celestial bodies for these experiments remains possible that these models are either incorrect only explain part the dark matter thus even with the multiple experiments dedicated providing indirect evidence for the existence cold dark direct detection measurements are also necessary solidify the theory although most wimps encountering the sun the earth are expected pass through without any hoped that large number dark matter wimps crossing sufficiently large detector will interact often enough least few events per the general strategy current attempts detect wimps find very sensitive systems that can scaled large this follows the lessons learned from the history the discovery and routine detection the cdms technique used the cryogenic dark matter search detector the soudan mine relies multiple very cold germanium and silicon the crystals each about the size hockey are cooled about layer metal aluminium and the surfaces used detect wimp passing through the this design hopes detect vibrations the crystal matrix generated atom being kicked the tungsten transition edge sensors are held the critical temperature they are the superconducting state large crystal vibrations will generate heat the metal and are detectable because change resistance february researchers the soudan mine cdms experiment announced that they had observed two events that may have been caused nucleus cogent smaller detector using single germanium designed sense wimps with smaller reported hundreds detection events days juan who presented the results conference the university was looking very beautiful matter other such unexplained radioactive decay process the might cause spurious the experiment estimated the wimp masses gev approximately the mass proton which lower limit detection the cdmsii drift the directional recoil identification from tracks collaboration attempting utilize the predicted directionality the wimp signal order prove the existence drift detectors use volume low pressure carbon disulfide gas target the use low pressure gas means that wimp colliding with atom the target will cause recoil several millimetres leaving track charged particles the this charged track drifted mwpc readout plane that allows reconstructed three which can then used determine the direction the wimp came scintillators another way detecting atoms knocked wimp use scintillating material that light pulses are generated the moving experiments such deap snolab warp the lngs plan instrument very large target mass liquid argon for sensitive wimp another example this technique the dama nai and dama libra detector uses multiple materials identify false signals from other creating this experiment observed annual change the rate signals the this annual modulation one the predicted signatures wimp and this basis the dama collaboration has claimed positive other however have not confirmed this the cdms and edelweiss experiments would expected observe significant number nucleus scatters the dama signal were fact caused since the other experiments not see these the interpretation the dama result wimp detection can excluded for most wimp possible devise models that reconcile positive dama result with the other negative but the sensitivity other experiments this becomes more the cdms data taken the soudan mine and made public may exclude the entire dama signal region given certain standard assumptions about the properties the wimps and the dark matter picasso the picasso project canada search for supersymmetric experiment direct dark matter search experiment that located snolab uses bubble detectors with freon the active picasso predominantly sensitive dependent interactions wimps with the fluorine atoms the bubble detector radiation sensitive device that uses small droplets superheated liquid that are suspended gel uses the principle bubble chamber but since only the small droplets can undergo phase transition time the detector can stay active for much longer periods than classic bubble when enough energy deposited droplet ionizing radiation the superheated droplet undergoes phase transition and becomes gas the picasso detectors contain freon droplets with average diameter the bubble development the detector accompanied acoustic shock wave that picked electric the main advantage the bubble detector technique that the detector almost insensitive background the detector sensitivity can adjusted changing the temperature the freon loaded detectors are typically operated temperatures between and there another similar experiment using this technique europe called simple picasso reports results november for dependent wimp interactions dark matter signal has been but for wimp masses gev new stringent limits have been obtained the
