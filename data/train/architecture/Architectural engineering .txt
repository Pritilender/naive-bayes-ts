architecture	architectural engineering navigation search sar pelli ratner athletic center cables counterweights masts architectural engineering also known building engineering the application engineering principles and technology building design and construction definitions architectural engineer may refer engineer the structural mechanical electrical construction other engineering fields building design and licensed engineering professional parts the united states informal and formally some professional synonymous with similar architect contents engineering for building structural engineering mechanical electrical and plumbing the architectural engineer the united states the architect architectural engineer education architectural engineering single integrated field study see also references engineering for building structural engineering structural engineering structural engineering involves the analysis and design physical objects bridges equipment towers and those concentrating buildings are responsible for the structural performance large part the built environment and sometimes informally referred building structural engineers require expertise strength materials and the seismic design structures covered earthquake engineering architectural engineers sometimes practice structural one aspect their the structural discipline when practiced specialty works closely with architects and other engineering mechanical electrical and plumbing mechanical electrical and plumbing mechanical engineering and electrical engineering engineers are commonly referred mep electrical and when engaged the building design also known building services engineering the united kingdom canada and australia mechanical engineers often design and oversee the heating ventilation and air conditioning plumbing and rain gutter systems plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems but for more complicated fire protection engineers are often separately electrical engineers are responsible for the power distribution telecommunication fire alarm signalization lightning protection and control systems well lighting systems the architectural engineer the united states architectural engineer many jurisdictions the united the architectural engineer licensed engineering usually graduate architectural engineering university program preparing students perform building design competition with engineer for practice one mechanical electrical fields building but with appreciation integrated architectural formal architectural engineering following the engineering model earlier developed the late and became widespread the united states the with the establishment specific architectural ncees professional engineering registration examination the and first offering april architectural engineering became recognized distinct engineering discipline the united architectural engineers are not entitled practice architecture unless they are also licensed the architect architectural engineer architect some countries profession providing architectural services sometimes referred architectural such the terms architecture and building are used the practice architecture includes the designing and overseeing the some such korean and arabic architect literally translated architectural some architectural such the ingegnere edile entitled practice architecture and often referred these individuals are often also structural other such austria iran and most the arabic architecture graduates receive engineering degree dipl diplom ingenieur spain the architect has high technical university education and legal povers project building structures and architects and engineers used share the same accreditation process confea federal council architecture and now the brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process cau architecture and urbanism besides traditional architecture design brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training engineering disciplines such electrical hydraulic and mechanical after architects can fully responsible for design and construction these areas except electric where the architect autonomy limited systems applied urban built cultural landscape interiorscape planning and regional greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong the polytechnic obtaining engineering they graduate after years studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members the technical chamber greece the engineering diploma equals degree ects units according the bologna education engineer degree the structural mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled completion university air handling unit acoustic engineering hvac architectural engineering single integrated field study building engineering education what differentiates architectural engineering separate and integrated field compared other engineering its disciplinary engineering through training and appreciation the field seeks integration building systems within its overall building architectural engineering includes the design building systems including heating ventilation and air conditioning plumbing fire protection electrical lighting architectural acoustics and structural some university students are required concentrate one the they can receive generalist architectural building
