the illumination the objective architectural lighting design obtain sufficient light for the purposes the balancing factors initial and operating appearance and energy lighting designers are often specialists who must understand the physics light production and and the physiology and psychology light perception architectural lighting design generally concerned with the permanent illumination concert and theatrical lighting have different purposes and contents concept lighting design methods profession architectural lighting design media notable architectural lighting designers see also references external links concept lighting design comprehensive lighting design requires consideration the amount functional light the energy well the aesthetic impact supplied the lighting some like surgical centers and sports are primarily concerned with providing the appropriate amount light for the associated some like warehouses and office are primarily concerned with saving money through the energy efficiency the lighting other like casinos and are primarily concerned with enhancing the appearance and emotional impact architecture through lighting therefore important that the sciences light production and luminaire photometrics are balanced with the artistic application light medium our built these electrical lighting systems should also consider the impacts and ideally integrated daylighting factors involved lighting design are essentially the same those discussed above energy conservation architectural lighting design focuses three fundamental aspects the illumination buildings the first the aesthetic appeal aspect particularly important the illumination retail environments secondly the ergonomic aspect the measure how much function the lighting thirdly the energy efficiency issue ensure that light not wasted over illumination either illuminating vacant spaces unnecessarily providing more light than needed for the aesthetics the each these three aspects looked considerable detail when the lighting designer aesthetic the lighting designer attempts raise the general attractiveness the measure whether should subtly blended into the background whether should stand and assess what kind emotions the lighting should the functional aspects the project can encompass the need for the project visible night but also the impact daylight the project and safety issues glare colour confusion methods for simple hand calculations based tabular data can used provide acceptable lighting more critical optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling based the positions and mounting heights the and their photometric the proposed lighting layout can checked for uniformity and quantity for larger projects those with irregular floor lighting design software can each fixture has its location and the reflectance ceiling and floors can the computer program will then produce set contour charts overlaid the project floor showing the light level expected the working more advanced programs can include the effect light from windows allowing further optimization the operating cost the lighting the amount daylight received internal space can typically analized undertaking daylight factor calculation the zonal cavity method used basis for both tabulated and computer this method uses the reflectance coefficients room surfaces model the contribution useful illumination the working level the room due light reflected from the walls and the simplified photometric values are usually given fixture manufacturers for use this computer modeling outdoor flood lighting usually proceeds directly from photometric the total lighting power lamp divided into small solid angular each region extended the surface which lit and the area giving the light power per unit where multiple lamps are used illuminate the same each contribution again the tabulated light levels lux can presented contour lines constant lighting overlaid the project plan hand calculations might only required few but computer calculations allow better estimate the uniformity and lighting practical lighting design must take into account the gradual decrease light levels from each lamp owing lamp lamp and dirt accumulation fixture and lamp empirically established depreciation factors are listed lighting design profession prior the the concept illumination architecture was not considered important many architects consulting this changed with the formation the international association lighting designers the current mission which serve the iald worldwide membership promoting the visible success its members practicing lighting this created new attitude towards the profession and raised the profile architectural lighting one the principal goals the the european lighting association later was formed elda changed its name the professional lighting designers association these two organizations are the main authorities regarding lighting design the illuminating engineering society north america seeks improve the lighted environment bringing together those with lighting knowledge and translating that knowledge into actions that benefit the the national council qualifications for the lighting professions profit organization founded serve and protect the being the public through effective and efficient lighting through review the ncqlp establishes the experience and examination requirements for baseline certification across the lighting the ncqlp has established certification process which practitioners lighting and related through demonstrate their knowledge and experience across the lighting those who successfully complete the ncqlp lighting certification examination are entitled use the lighting after their name for professional the international commission illumination organization devoted international cooperation and exchange information among its member countries all matters relating the science and art cie works globally develop and publish lighting design standardization and practice the professional lighting sound association plasa represents the interests many lighting designers and several which are involved the architectural lighting plasa but does represent companies european and international there are many more based organizations such the schweizerische licht gesellschaft the association des concepteurs clairagistes france the hellenic illumination committee greece and the associazione professionisti illuminazione italy architectural lighting design media with the increase global focus green design and energy lighting design and its role sustainability have become more well resulting number specific trade publications and increase coverage architectural the following are
