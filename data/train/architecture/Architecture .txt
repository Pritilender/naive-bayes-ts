modern concepts architecture the notable century architect louis sullivan promoted overriding precept architectural form follows function while the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations

functional aspects that has common with other human through its own particular way expressing values architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming and will promote social restrict the meaning formalism art for sake not only can also purposeless quest for perfection originality which degrades form into mere among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach building design are rationalism empiricism structuralism poststructuralism and phenomenology the late century new concept was added those included the compass both structure and the consideration sustainability hence sustainable architecture satisfy the contemporary ethos building should constructed manner which environmentally friendly terms the production its its impact upon the natural and built environment its surrounding area and the demands that makes upon sustainable power sources for cooling water and waste management and lighting history history architecture origins and vernacular architecture vernacular architecture norway building first evolved out the dynamics between needs security worship etc and means available building materials and attendant human cultures developed and knowledge began formalized through oral traditions and building became craft and architecture the name given the most highly formalized and respected versions that widely assumed that architectural success was the product process trial and with progressively less trial and more replication the results the process proved increasingly what termed vernacular architecture continues produced many parts the indeed vernacular buildings make most the built world that people experience every early human settlements were mostly rural due surplus production the economy began expand resulting urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly some such that atal anatolia and mohenjo daro the indus valley civilization day pakistan giza egypt ancient

architectural training the for example ecole des beaux arts france gave much emphasis the production beautiful drawings and little context and effective architects generally received their training

books and architectural modernism and reaction modern architecture bauhaus walter gropius around the beginning the general dissatisfaction with the emphasis revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise many new lines thought that served precursors modern notable among these the deutscher werkbund formed produce better quality machine made the rise the profession industrial

modern architecture was first was avant garde movement with philosophical and aesthetic immediately after world war pioneering modernist architects sought develop completely new style appropriate for new war social and economic focused meeting the needs the middle and working they rejected the architectural practice the academic refinement historical styles which served the rapidly declining

which the form was defined its environment and with aim promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being robie house and falling water crystal cathedral

the whole form and its function are tied gives idea these architecture today gare oriente lisbon santiago calatrava since the the complexity buildings began increase terms structural services energy and the field architecture became disciplinary with specializations for each project technological expertise project delivery there has been increased separation the architect notes from the architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters notes the preparatory processes for the design any large building have become increasingly and require preliminary studies such matters sustainability quality money and compliance with local large structure can longer the design one person but must the work modernism and postmodernism have been criticised some members the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture not personal philosophical aesthetic pursuit rather has consider everyday needs people and use technology create liveable with the design process being informed studies environmental and social green roof museum france environmental sustainability has become mainstream with profound affect the architectural many those who support the financing have become educated encourage the facilitation environmentally sustainable rather than solutions based primarily immediate major examples this can found greener roof designs biodegradable materials and more attention energy this major shift architecture has also changed architecture schools focus more the sustainability architecture was pioneered frank lloyd wright the buckminster fuller and the architects such ian mcharg and sim van der ryn the and brenda and robert vale the and new there has been acceleration the number buildings which seek meet green building sustainable design principles sustainable practices that were the core vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary the green
