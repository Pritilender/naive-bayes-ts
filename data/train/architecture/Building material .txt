energy and social costs building economic costs the initial economic cost building materials the purchase this often what governs decision making about what materials sometimes people take into consideration the energy savings durability the materials and see the value paying higher initial cost return for lower lifetime for example asphalt shingle roof costs less than metal roof but the metal roof will last longer the lifetime cost less per risks when considering lifetime cost material the building damaged such fire the material not durable ecological costs ecological footprint

manufacture deliver install the the life time embodied energy continues grow with the maintenance and disposal the building materials themselves and how the materials and design help minimize the time energy consumption the social costs social costs are injury and health the people producing and transporting the materials and potential health problems the building occupants there are problems with the building biology globalization has had significant impacts people both terms skills and sufficiency are lost when manufacturing facilities are closed and the cultural aspects where new facilities are aspects fair trade and labor rights are social costs global building material naturally occurring substances brush mohaves brush structures are built entirely from plant parts and were used primitive cultures such native pygmy peoples africa these are built mostly with twigs and and similar beaver these were variously named wikiups lean and extension the brush building idea the wattle and daub process which clay soils dung usually cow are used fill and cover woven brush this gives the structure more thermal mass and wattle and daub one the oldest building many older timber frame buildings incorporate wattle and daub non load bearing walls between the timber ice and snow snow and occasionally were used the inuit peoples for igloos and snow used built shelter called quinzhee ice has also been used for ice hotels tourist attraction northern mud and clay clay based buildings usually come two distinct one being when the walls are made directly with the mud and the other being walls built stacking dried building blocks called mud bricks other uses clay building combined with straws create light clay wattle and daub and mud plaster wet laid clay walls rammed earth sod cob wet walls are made using the mud clay mixture directly without forming blocks and drying them the amount and type each material the mixture used leads different styles the deciding factor usually connected with the quality the soil being larger amounts clay are usually employed building with cob while clay soil usually associated with sod house sod roof construction the other main ingredients include more less sand gravel and straw rammed earth both old and newer take creating once made compacting clay soils between planks nowadays forms and mechanical pneumatic compressors are soil and especially provides good thermal mass very good keeping temperatures constant homes built with earth tend naturally cool the summer heat and warm cold clay holds heat releasing over period time like earthen walls change temperature artificially raising lowering the temperature can use more resources than say wood built but the coolness stays peoples building with mostly dirt and such sod and created homes that have been built for centuries western and northern asia well the rest the and continue though smaller some these buildings have remained habitable for hundreds structural clay blocks and bricks adobe mudbrick compressed earth block bricks also known their spanish name adobe are ancient building materials with evidence dating back thousands years compressed earth blocks are more modern type brick used for building more frequently industrialized society since the building blocks can manufactured off site centralized location brickworks and transported multiple building these blocks can also monetized more easily and structural mud bricks are almost always made using often clay soil and binder are the only ingredients but other ingredients can include lime concrete stone and other binders the formed compressed block then air dried and can laid dry with mortar clay slip sand sand used with cement and sometimes lime make mortar for masonry work and plaster sand also used part the concrete important cost building material countries with high sand content soils the sandcrete block which weaker but cheaper than fired clay stone rock rock structures have existed for long history can the longest lasting building material and usually readily there are many types rock throughout the all with differing attributes that make them better worse for particular rock very dense material gives lot protection its main drawback material its weight and its energy density also considered big stone hard keep warm without using large amounts heating dry stone walls have been built for long humans have put one stone top eventually different forms mortar were used hold the stones cement being the most commonplace the granite strewn uplands dartmoor national united for provided ample resources for early circular huts were constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the neolithic and early bronze age and the remains estimated can still seen granite continued used throughout the medieval period see dartmoor longhouse and into modern slate another stone commonly used roofing material the united kingdom and other parts the world where stone buildings can seen most major some civilizations built entirely with stone such the egyptian and aztec pyramids and the structures the inca civilization thatch thatch one the oldest building materials grass good insulator and easily many african tribes have lived homes made completely grasses and sand thatch roofs homes were once prevalent but the material fell out favor industrialization and improved transport increased the availability other today though the practice undergoing the for many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles wood and timber gliwice radio tower poland wood has been used building material for thousands years its natural today engineered wood becoming very common industrialized wood product trees and sometimes other fibrous plants used for construction purposes when cut pressed into lumber and such planks and similar generic building material and used building just about any type structure most wood can very flexible under keeping strength while and incredibly strong when compressed there are many differing qualities the different types even among same tree this means specific species are better suited for various uses than and growing conditions are important for deciding timber the term used for construction purposes except the term lumber used the united raw wood trunk bole becomes timber when the wood has been converted hewn split the forms minimally processed logs stacked top each other timber frame construction and light frame construction the main problems with timber structures are fire risk and related citation needed modern times softwood used value bulk whereas hardwood usually used for finishings and historically timber frame structures were built with oak western recently douglas fir has become the most popular wood for most types structural many families rural have personal woodlot from which the family community will grow and harvest trees build with these lots are tended like this was much more prevalent industrial when laws existed the amount wood one could cut any one time ensure there would supply timber for the but still viable form man made substances fired bricks and clay blocks bricks are made similar way bricks except without the fibrous binder such straw and are fired burned brick clamp kiln after they have dried permanently harden kiln fired clay bricks are ceramic material fired bricks can solid have hollow cavities aid drying and make them lighter and easier the individual bricks are placed upon each other courses using mortar successive courses being used build arches and other architectural fired brick walls are usually substantially thinner than adobe while keeping the same vertical they require more energy create but are easier transport and and are lighter than stone romans extensively used fired brick shape and type now called roman bricks building with brick gained much popularity the century and this was due lower costs with increases brick manufacturing and safety the ever crowding the cinder block supplemented replaced fired bricks the late century often being used for the inner parts masonry walls and structural clay tiles clay are clay terracotta and typically are perforated with cement composites cement bonded composites are made hydrated cement paste that binds particles fibers make cast building various fiberous including paper fiberglass and carbon fiber have been used wood and natural fibers are composed various soluble organic compounds like carbohydrates glycosides and these compounds are known retard cement therefore before using wood making cement bonded its compatibility with cement wood cement compatibility the ratio parameter related the property cement composite that neat cement the compatibility often expressed percentage determine cement methods based different properties are such hydration strength interfacial bond and various methods are used researchers such the measurement hydration characteristics aggregate the comparison the mechanical properties aggregate mixes and the visual assessment microstructural properties the cement has been found that the hydration test measuring the change hydration temperature with time the most convenient recently karade have reviewed these methods compatibility assessment and suggested method based the maturity taking consideration both time and temperature cement hydration bricks were laid lime mortar from the time the romans until supplanted portland cement mortar the early cement blocks also sometimes are filled with grout covered with parge coat concrete falkirk wheel concrete composite building material made from the combination aggregate and binder such cement the most common form concrete portland cement which consists mineral aggregate generally gravel and sand portland cement and water after the cement hydrates and eventually hardens into like when used the generic this the material referred the term concrete for concrete construction any concrete has rather low tensile strength generally strengthened using steel rods bars known rebars this strengthened concrete then referred reinforced concrete order minimise any air that would weaken the vibrator used eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid concrete mix poured around the concrete has been the predominant building material the modern age due its formability and ease recent such insulating concrete forms combine the concrete forming and other construction steps installation all materials must taken required proportions described fabric the tent the home choice among nomadic groups all over the two known types include the conical teepee and the circular yurt the tent has been revived major construction technique with the development tensile architecture and synthetic modern buildings can made flexible material such fabric membranes and supported system steel rigid air foam firestop mortar toronto synthetic polystyrene polyurethane foam has been used combination with structural such easily and excellent foam usually used part structural insulated panel wherein the foam sandwiched between wood cement insulating concrete glass glassmaking considered art form well industrial process clear windows have been used since the invention glass cover small openings glass panes provided humans with the ability both let light into rooms while the same time keeping inclement weather glass generally made from mixtures sand and silicates very hot fire stove called kiln and very additives are often included the mixture used produce glass with shades colors various characteristics such bulletproof glass light emittance the use glass architectural buildings has become very popular the modern glass curtain walls can used cover the entire facade can used span over wide roof structure space frame these uses though require some sort frame hold sections glass glass itself too brittle and would require overly large kiln used span such large areas glass bricks were invented the early gypcrete gypcrete mixture gypsum plaster and fibreglass although plaster and fibres fiborous plaster have been used for many especially for was not until the early that serious studies the strength and qualities walling system rapidwall using mixture gypsum plaster and plus fibreglass were was through testing the university adelaide that these walls had load bearing shear and lateral resistance together with fire and thermal with abundance gypsum naturally occurring and product chemical fgd and phospho available gypcrete based building which are fully offer significant environmental metal metal used structural framework for larger buildings such skyscrapers external surface there are many types metals used for metal figures quite prominently prefabricated structures such the quonset hut and can seen used most cosmopolitan requires great deal human labor produce especially the large amounts needed for the building corrosion prime enemy when comes steel metal alloy whose major component iron and the usual choice for metal structural building flexible and refined well treated lasts long the lower density and better corrosion resistance aluminium alloys and tin sometimes overcome their greater cost bad ahrweiler copper valued building material because its advantageous properties copper architecture these include corrosion durability low thermal light radio frequency lightning sustainability recyclability and wide range copper incorporated into flashing gutters downspouts domes spires vaults wall building expansion and indoor design other metals used include chrome gold silver and titanium titanium can used for structural but much more expensive than chrome gold and silver are used because these materials are expensive and lack structural qualities such tensile strength plastics pipes concrete the term plastics covers range synthetic synthetic organic condensation polymerization products that can molded extruded into films fibers their name derived from the fact that their liquid state they are have the property plasticity plastics vary immensely heat hardness and combined with this the general uniformity composition and lightness plastics ensures their use almost all industrial applications papers and membranes building papers and membranes are used for many reasons one the oldest building papers red rosin paper which was known use before and was used underlayment exterior roofs and floors and for protecting jobsite during tar paper was invented late the century and was used for similar purposes rosin paper and for gravel roofs tar paper has largely fallen out use supplanted asphalt felt paper felt paper has been supplanted some uses synthetic particularly roofing synthetic underlayments and siding housewraps there are wide variety damp proofing and waterproofing membranes used for basement waterproofing and geomembranes ceramics fired clay bricks have been used since the time the special tiles are used for siding flooring ceilings pipes flue and building products the market place the term building often refers made made from various that are fitted architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts the list building products excludes the building materials used construct the building architecture and supporting like doors cabinets etc building
