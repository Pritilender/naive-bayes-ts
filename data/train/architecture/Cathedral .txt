whose bishops have tended predominantly arise through the ranks cathedral history and organisation origins and characteristics the first cathedrals the history cathedrals starts the year when the emperor constantine the great personally adopted christianity and initiated the peace the church indeed strict there could not have been cathedrals before that before the century there were christian cathedrae bishops were never seated when leading congregational but instead presided standing raised platform pulpitum the third the phrase ascending the pulpitum venire becomes the standard term for christian ordination during the siege dura europos complete christian house domus ecclesiae was entombed defensive surviving when places top the dura church had been converted out large urban courtyard house standard which two rooms had been knocked together make assembly capable holding standing while tank had been inserted room the opposite side the courtyard with rich wall paintings above the large room was indeed found have raised pulptum one big enough for one person turn preach and preside but too low have been surmounted and too small have contained otherwise the large room had decoration distinctive features soon after dura fell the persian body clerics assembled charge sheet against the bishop paul samosata the form open amongst the accusations was that who had received the civil rank ducenarius due contacts the imperial had improperly erected secretum for himself the church that within this enclosure had erected throne from which presided and that had trained female choir sing hymns his own these practices were all condemned improperly importing the symbols his secular roman magistracy into church while presumptuously and blasphemously asserting that the person the bishop eucharistic worship seated the place christ yet within hundred all bishops the mediterranean world had all sat thrones within enclosed sanctuary and all had established trained choirs enhance eucharistic the driving principle underlying this change was the acceptance more less imperial invitation adopt and maintain the dignity and insignia proper public magistrate characteristically roman magistrate presided from raised throne richly decorated and aisled rectangular hall called basilica and now bishops would the the earliest these new basilican cathedrals which

separate surviving from both large basilican halls are rich mosaic pavements showing amongst other jonah and the whale and series mainly donor appears that similar cathedrals basilica and baptistry were soon afterwards erected milan trier and pavia but that subsequently basilican churches became the more common cathedral constantine declaration imperial favour towards christianity transformed all aspects christian life the roman from being minority largely confined urban areas and restricted social and subject official hostility and occasional christianity acquired greatly expanded numbers potential adherents all initially still within city but eventually extending out the pagus the rural the consequence was radical expansion the funding and personnel associated church establishments throughout the the first cathedrals represent this expansion material cathedral buildings the location and layout the first cathedrals varied substantially from city although tended sited within the city walls but away from the urban but certain elements are almost always the basilica basilican halls had previously been characteristic major civic complexes and military headquarters but now became the standard structure for accommodating large christian from now the term basilica denotes any substantial church these new basilicas were wholly different scale from earlier christian assembly they were also different form from any roman christian temple religious the halls were aisled and flooded with light from large clerestory windows floors and walls were richly decorated with mosaic and inlay usually abstract floral the two original double basilicas aquileia had both been about but within years one hall was quadrupled this expanded basilica now demonstrated three additional features that became characteristic early enclosure the eastern end the church surrounding the synthronos east the altar facing and consisting raised dais with centrally place throne and benches either side for the clergy his familia and paritioned off narthex the western end into which catechumens would withdraw during the central act the eucharistic liturgy the baptistery the baptistery the dura church

charged continuing associate with other women even without any indication actual was creating unacceptable potential for avoid similar such occasions was necessary for the new cathedrals create only living quarters for the bishop and his entire and churches the all presbyters and deacons were also expected live apart from their wives after these living the episcopium were necessarily substantial addition eating and sleeping quarters for ordained boys and the episcopium also commonly provided private dining halls for the hospitality expected the enhanced social private oratory chapel for the and often bath cathedral finances just the episcopal residence was integral within the complex cathedral too there was distinction between diocesan and cathedral property and all diocesan income was paid into common and divided into four fixed shares for each main area the bishop the cathedral the fabric and lighting cathedral and city and charitable many diocese already held substantial but income increased enormously with the peace the partly due imperial subsidies but mainly from private bequests and regular private benefactions often called first although this tithe was never paid the many individual landowners supported private chapels and oratories their own and endowed independent charitable and eventually monasteries and nunneries the share augustine hippo estimated his personal income being times that his minor civil and augustine was means the wealthiest bishop north but accepting from constantine the status civil bishops were now also committed substantial

all bishops dedicated substantial sums the support orphans and the such donations had been strong feature the church earlier but tended then specifically directed the christian now the charitable compass became bishops were especially expected take responsibility for raising ransom where local persons had fallen was expected that each diocese would support xenodochium hostel for the homeless and cathedral personnel just the status the bishop was transfomed the peace the too was that the male with the bishop now resident the episcopium the other male clergy came recognised his formal familia mark which male clergy now received the tonsure shaving their this being originally roman badge the early church had recognised the orders presbyter and but range minor orders had since grown and all were these orders now tended understood clerical equivalent those the such that the male clergy are now often referred clerical and the roman military civil promotion was expected follow the pinciple cursus honorum rising through the with the expectation that minimum period would served the female orders widow and deacon remained explicitly outside the and they did not receive the tonsure

presbyters male subdeacons lectors singers doorkeepers and female the bishop bishops were the head the local but not explicitly within the cursus honorum appointment was election from the local clergy and not the clergy tended favour appointment bishops from within the ranks cathedral but local lay choice often tended rather either spectacular holy hermit otherwise senior civil servant who might have favourable contacts exploit but most bishops came from the curial class that those holding the hereditary rank decurion with the obligation serve the city only persons this class and above would likely have full rhetorical education greek and latin without which was not possible for boy raised with knowledge only late antique vernacular speech express himself approved classical linguistic the and archpriest was expected that the normal president both the eucharist and baptism would the who would celebrate the cathedral and titular churches but the bishop needed deputies for eucharistic and also for the divine office daily and this duty fell the the bishop selected senior presbyter archpriest who acted his official deputy all ritual matters and head the the archpriest was also responsible for the cathedral grammar after the there were longer supported secular teachers rhetoric and grammar the west other than parts and the church would have educate its the male deacons and and archdeacon just the presbyters deputised for the bishop ritual the deacons deputised administrative and financial especially the raising and delivering the head the diaconate was the the main deputy managerial originally inferior rank the the archdeacon the sixth century had established clear subdeacons assisted the but unlike them were allowed marry after consequently many clerics stopped the cursus honorum this and was not unusual for subdeacon elected and even the exorcists lectors and and primicerius the first three these orders tended given and were typically applied boys young these boy lectors were too young for the grammar but were valued and were included the schola cantorum choir originally under the responsibility the the organisation choirs was reformed pope gregory

professional choirs sound musical training undertaking cathedral worship and such skills are not guaranteed present ranking women virgins widows and female deacons these orders had been considerable importance earlier but tended sidelined cathedrals from the century long adult baptism continued regular female deacons would continue needed for that but otherwise the main factor maintaining these orders was effect from the rule continence applied presbyters and when man became and moved into the episcopium with the rest the bishops familia then there would usually also requirement for support their wives and and the orders widows and virgins respectively continued largely for this functions the first cathedrals notwithstanding wide differences over time institutional structures and wider

history the body clergy attached the cathedral church and each case local considerations affected its however the main features were more less common originally the bishop and cathedral clergy formed kind religious which while not the true sense monastery was nevertheless often called monasterium the word not having the restricted meaning which afterwards this lies the reason for the apparent anomaly that churches like york minster and lincoln cathedral which never had any monks attached have inherited the name minster these early communities the clergy often lived apart their own and were
