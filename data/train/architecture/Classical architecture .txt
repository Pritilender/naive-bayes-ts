contexts than those for which they were however for baroque rococo architecture are styles although classical display architectural language very much their own during these architectural theory still referred classical ideas but rather less sincerely than during the reaction late baroque and rococo architectural theorists from circa through what became known neoclassicism again consciously and earnestly attempted emulate supported recent developments classical archaeology and desire for architecture based clear rules and claude perrault marc antoine laugier and carlo lodoli were among the

least theory was considered the prime source inspiration for architectural endeavours the west for much modern history even because personal theoretically diverse interpretations the antique classicism covers broad range some even speak like neo palladian architecture which draws its inspiration from the works italian renaissance architect andrea palladio who himself drew inspiration from ancient roman furthermore can even argued noted that styles architecture not typically considered like can said contain classical therefore simple delineation the scope classical architecture

the wood these early but the forms and shapes the old wooden styles were just the wooden structures had turned thus the designation petrification sometimes petrified for this this careful preservation
