team design construct and maintain the building construction building construction the process adding structure real property construction the vast majority building construction jobs are small such addition renovation often the owner the property acts paymaster and design team for the entire project however all building construction projects include some elements design financial estimating and

construction the recent movements new urbanism and new classical architecture promote sustainable approach towards that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design this contrast modernist and lived globally uniform architecture well opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl both trends started the construction processes design team shasta dam the modern industrialized construction usually involves the translation designs into formal design team may assembled plan the physical and integrate those proceedings with the other the design usually consists drawings and specifications usually prepared design team including surveyors civil engineers cost engineers quantity surveyors mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural and archaeological the design team most commonly employed contract the property under this once the design completed the design number construction companies construction management companies may then asked make bid for the either based directly the the basis drawings and bill quantities provided quantity surveyor following evaluation the owner will typically award contract the most cost efficient the modern trend design toward integration previously separated especially among large the architects interior engineers developers construction and general contractors were more likely entirely separate even the larger presently firm that nominally architecture construction firm may have experts from all related fields have associated company that provides each necessary thus each such firm may offer itself stop for construction from beginning this designated design contract where the contractor given performance specification and must undertake the project from design while adhering the performance several project structures can assist the owner this including partnering and construction each these project structures allows the owner integrate the services interior engineers and constructors throughout design and many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings design construction services alone and are placing more emphasis establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the build the increasing complexity construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained all phases the cycle and develop appreciation the building advanced technological system requiring close integration many systems and their individual including building engineering emerging discipline that attempts meet this new financial advisors trump international hotel and tower construction projects can suffer from preventable financial underbids ask for too little money complete the cash flow problems exist when the present amount funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and and because they are matter having sufficient funds specific can arise even when the overall total fraud problem many but notoriously prevalent the construction field citation needed financial planning for the project intended ensure that solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are place before the project started and required ensure that the plan properly executed over the life the mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers are likely participants creating overall plan for the financial management the building construction the presence the mortgage banker highly even relatively small projects since the equity the property the most obvious source funding for building accountants act study the expected monetary flow over the life the project and monitor the payouts throughout the cost engineers and estimators apply expertise relate the work and materials involved proper cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor was able identify change orders changes the project resulting large increases which are not subject competition other firms they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with conceptual estimate

which must carefully contract the exchange set obligations between two more but not simple matter trying get the other side agree much possible exchange for little the time element construction means that delay costs and cases the delay can extremely thus the contracts must designed ensure that each side capable performing the obligations set contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths accomplishing those expectations are far more likely result the project flowing whereas poorly drafted contracts lead confusion and legal advisors the beginning construction project seek

facilitates exchange obligations that matches the reality the interaction expertise daegu south korea finance and legal aspects overlap and the design must not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and but must also financially possible and legal the financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design and must pay amounts that are legally the legal structure must integrate the design into the surrounding legal and enforce the financial consequences the construction procurement procurement describes the merging activities undertaken the client obtain there are many different methods construction however the three most common types procurement traditional design and build management contracting there also growing number new forms procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within construction new forms include partnering such private partnering aka private finance initiatives and alliances such pure project alliances and impure strategic alliances the focus operation ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction traditional design build this the most common method construction procurement and well established and this the architect engineer acts the project his her role design the prepare the specifications and produce construction administer the tender the and manage the works from inception there are direct contractual links between the client and the main any subcontractor will have direct contractual relationship with the main design and build design build havelock city project sri lanka this approach has become more common recent and involves the client contracting single entity both provide design and build that some the design and build package can also include finding the arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory the owner produces list requirements for giving overall view the several contractors present different ideas about how accomplish these the owner selects the ideas she likes best and hires the appropriate often not just one but consortium several contractors working once contractor has been they begin building the first phase the they build phase they design phase this contrast build where the project completely designed the then bid then kent hansen pointed out that state departments transportation usually use design build contracts way getting projects done when states have the design build contracts are usually used for very large management procurement systems construction management this arrangement the client plays active role the procurement system entering into separate contracts with the designer architect engineer the construction manager and individual trade contractors the client takes the contractual while the construction project manager provides the active role managing the separate trade and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively management procurement systems are often used speed the procurement allow the client greater flexibility design variation throughout the give the ability appoint individual work separate contractual responsibility each individual throughout the and provide greater client authority having jurisdiction planning permission cuta colombia the authority having jurisdiction the governmental agency agency which regulates the construction most this the municipality which the building however construction performed for municipal authorities are usually regulated directly the owning which becomes the kansas missouri before the foundation can contractors are typically required verify and have existing utility lines either the utilities themselves through company specializing such this lessens the likelihood damage the existing water sewage phone and cable which could cause outages and potentially hazardous during the construction the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically ensure that the construction adheres the approved plans and the local building code once construction complete and final inspection has been occupancy permit may operating building must remain compliance with the fire code the fire code enforced the local fire changes made building that affect including its expansion structural and fire protection items usually require approval the ahj for review concerning the building industry characteristics the united the industry has around billion annual revenue according statistics tracked the census with billion annual rate march which billion private split evenly between residential and and the remainder there were about firms employing million contractors general heavy and specialty the average contractor employed fewer than employees the industry employed estimated million april with unemployment careers alma ironworkers massachusetts general hospital boston gamil djibouti there are many routes the different careers within the construction these three main tiers are based educational background and which vary unskilled and general site labor with little construction skilled tradesmen who served typically labor unions and site managers who possess extensive knowledge and experience their craft profession technical and personnel with the greatest educational usually graduate degrees trained manage and instruct the construction skilled occupations include carpenters electricians plumbers ironworkers masons and many other manual well those involved project the these require further education qualifications often vocational subject these qualifications are either obtained directly after the completion compulsory education through the apprenticeship training the construction related apprenticeships were commenced technical and specialized occupations require more training greater technical knowledge these professions also hold more legal short list the main careers with outline the educational requirements are given quantity surveyor typically holds degree quantity chartered

revealed the differences remuneration between different sectors and locations the construction and built environment the results showed that areas particularly strong growth the construction such the middle east yield higher average salaries than the for the average earning for professional the construction industry the middle across all job types and levels compared the this trend not necessarily due the fact that more affluent roles are however architects with more years experience working the middle east earn average per compared the some construction workers the canada have made more than annually depending their safety construction site safety construction one the most dangerous occupations the incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector both the united states and the european union the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers the united states was nearly three times that for all falls are one the most common causes fatal and fatal injuries among construction proper safety equipment such harnesses and guardrails and procedures such securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk occupational injuries the construction other major causes fatalities the construction industry include transportation and trench history india history construction history architecture the first huts and shelters were constructed hand with simple cities grew during the bronze age class professional craftsmen like bricklayers and carpenters appeared occasionally slaves were used for construction the middle ages these were organized into guilds the steam powered machinery and later and electric powered vehicles such cranes excavators and bulldozers fast track construction has been increasingly popular the some estimates suggest that
