mechanical engineering notable early renaissance filippo brunelleschi lippo april was one the foremost architects and engineers the italian renaissance perhaps most famous for his development linear perspective and for engineering the dome the florence cathedral but his accomplishments also include other architectural sculpture mathematics engineering and even ship his principal surviving works are found florence italy little known about the early life the only sources being antonio manetti and giorgio vasari according these filippo father was brunellesco and his mother was giuliana filippo was the middle their three the young filippo was given literary and mathematical education intended enable him follow the footsteps his civil being artistically however filippo enrolled the arte della seta the silk guild which also included metalworkers and bronze became master goldsmith was thus not coincidence that his first important building the ospedale degli innocenti came from the guild which brunelleschi entered competition design new set bronze doors for the florence baptistery seven competitors each produced gilded bronze depicting the sacrifice isaac brunelleschi which with that lorenzo ghiberti one only two have made reference the roman boy with thorn whilst ghiberti used naked torso the classical style for his figure ghiberti was announced the largely because his superior

training the gothic medieval manner the new classicism architecture and urbanism that now loosely call the renaissance and which brunelleschi considered the seminal there emerged interest humanitas which contrasted with the formalism the medieval but initially this new interest roman antiquity was restricted few writers and did not first influence the visual apparently was this period that brunelleschi and his friend donatello visited rome study the ancient roman donatello like had received his training and had then worked although previous decades the writers and philosophers had discussed the glories ancient seems that until brunelleschi and donatello made their one had studied the physical fabric these ruins any great they gained inspiration too from ancient roman especially vitruvius whose architectura provided intellectual framework for the standing structures still commissions brunelleschi first architectural commission was the ospedale degli innocenti foundling its long loggia would have been rare sight the tight and curving streets not mention its impressive each about meters the building was dignified and there were displays fine marble decorative was also the first building florence make clear its columns and classical antiquity soon other commissions such the ridolfi chapel the church san jacopo arno now and the barbadori chapel santa trinita also modified since its for both brunelleschi devised elements already used the ospedale degli and which would also used the pazzi chapel and the sagrestia vecchia the same time was using such smaller works sort feasibility study for his most famous the dome the cathedral florence florence cathedral santa maria del fiore was the new cathedral the and the dome had yet when the building was designed the previous one had any idea about how such dome was given that was even larger than the pantheon dome rome and that dome that size had been built since because buttresses were forbidden the city and because was impossible obtain rafters for scaffolding long and strong enough and sufficient for the was unclear how dome that size could constructed without collapsing under its own weight the also the stresses compression were not clearly understood the and the mortars used the period would only set after several keeping the strain the scaffolding for very long the arte della the wool guild held competition solve the the two main competitors were ghiberti and with brunelleschi winning and receiving the the competition consisted the great architects attempting stand egg upright piece none could but who according vasari giving one end blow the flat piece made stand the architects protested that they could have done the but filippo laughing that they could have made the they had seen his the the lantern built and the exedra built would occupy most brunelleschi success can attributed small degree his technical and mathematical brunelleschi used more than million bricks the construction the invented new hoisting machine for raising the masonry needed for the task doubt inspired republication vitruvius architectura which describes roman machines used the first century build large structures such the pantheon and the baths diocletian structures still standing which would have seen for also issued one the first patents for the hoist attempt prevent theft his brunelleschi was

transport marble florence from pisa the arno river the ship sank its first along with sizable chunk personal besides accomplishments brunelleschi also credited with inventing point linear perspective which revolutionized painting and allowed for naturalistic styles develop the renaissance digressed from the stylized figures medieval was somewhat involved urban strategically positioned several his buildings relation the nearby squares and streets for maximum for demolitions front san lorenzo were approved order create piazza facing the santo suggested that the ade turned either towards the arno travelers would see the face prospective invention linear perspective brunelleschi famous for two panel paintings illustrating geometric optical linear perspective made the early his antonio manetti described this famous experiment which brunelleschi painted two the first the florentine baptistery viewed frontally from the western portal the unfinished and second the palazzo vecchio seen obliquely from its northwest these were however the first paintings with accurate linear which may attributed ambrogio lorenzetti the first baptistery panel was constructed with hole drilled through the centric vanishing curiously brunelleschi intended that only observed the viewer facing the looking through the hole the from the unpainted mirror was moved into and out the observer saw the striking similarity between the actual view the and the reflected view the painted baptistery brunelleschi wanted his new perspective realism tested not comparing the painted image the actual baptistery but its reflection mirror according the euclidean laws geometric this feat showed artists vividly how they might paint their not merely flat dimensional but looking more like dimensional structures just mirrors reflect unfortunately both panels have since been around this time linear novel artistic spread not only italy but throughout western quickly and standard studio theatrical machinery brunelleschi also designed machinery for use churches during theatrical religious performances that enacted biblical miracle contrivances were created which characters and angels were made fly through the air the midst spectacular explosions light and these events took place during state and ecclesiastical not known for certain how many these brunelleschi but least for the church san felice confirmed the death brunelleschi body lies the crypt the cathedral explained antonio manetti who knew brunelleschi and who wrote his brunelleschi was granted such honors buried the basilica
