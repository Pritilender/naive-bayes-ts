been designed arnolfo cambio his brick metres high metres long was standing side aisle the unfinished and had long ago become called for octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been with external buttresses keep from spreading and falling under its own smarthistory brunelleschi dome the commitment reject traditional gothic buttresses had been made when neri model was chosen over competing one giovanni lapo that architectural was one the first events the italian renaissance marking break with the medieval gothic style and return the classic mediterranean italian architects regarded gothic flying buttresses ugly furthermore the use buttresses was forbidden the style was favored central traditional enemies the neri model depicted massive inner open the top admit like pantheon but enclosed thinner outer partly supported the inner keep out the was stand unbuttressed octagonal drum neri dome would need internal defense against spreading hoop but none had yet been giotto campanile the building such masonry dome posed many technical brunelleschi looked the great dome the pantheon rome for the dome the pantheon single shell the formula for which had long since been wooden form had held the pantheon dome aloft while its concrete but for the height and breadth the dome designed starting metres above the floor and spanning metres there was not enough timber tuscany build the scaffolding and brunelleschi chose follow such design and employed double made sandstone and brunelleschi would have build the dome out due its light weight compared stone and easier and with nothing under during illustrate his proposed structural constructed wooden and brick model with the help donatello and nanni model which still displayed the museo opera del duomo the model served guide for the but was intentionally ensure control over the brunelleschi solutions were the spreading problem was solved set four internal horizontal stone and iron serving barrel embedded within the inner one the one the with the remaining two evenly spaced between fifth made was placed between the first and second the stone since the dome was octagonal rather than simple squeezing the dome like barrel would have put all its pressure the eight corners the the chains needed rigid stiff enough hold their not deform the dome they held each stone chains was built like octagonal railroad track with parallel rails and cross all made sandstone beams centimetres diameter and more than metres long the rails were connected end with glazed iron the cross ties and rails were notched together and then covered with the bricks and mortar the inner the cross ties the bottom chain can seen protruding from the drum the base the the others are each stone chain was supposed reinforced with standard iron chain made interlocking but magnetic survey conducted the failed detect any evidence iron which they exist are deeply embedded the thick masonry brunelleschi also included vertical ribs set the corners the curving towards the center the feet meters deep are supported concealed ribs radiating from the ribs had slits take beams that supported thus allowing the work progress upward without the need for circular masonry such that hagia sophia istanbul can built without called because each course bricks horizontal arch that resists the octagonal inner dome was thick enough for imaginary circle embedded each feature that would hold the dome but could not hold the bricks place while the mortar was still brunelleschi used herringbone brick pattern transfer the weight the freshly laid bricks the nearest vertical ribs the circular the outer dome was not thick enough contain embedded horizontal being only centimetres thick the base and centimetres thick the create such brunelleschi thickened the outer dome the inside its corners nine different creating nine masonry which can observed today from the space between the two counteract hoop the outer dome relies entirely
