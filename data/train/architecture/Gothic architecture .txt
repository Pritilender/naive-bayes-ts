angevin empire whose plantagenet kings ruled england and large domains what was become modern norway came under the influence while the other scandinavian countries and poland were influenced trading contacts with the hanseatic angevin kings brought the gothic tradition from france southern while lusignan kings introduced french gothic architecture throughout europe this time there was rapid growth trade and associated growth germany and the lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew comparative trade and competition with each united for mutual the hanseatic league civic building was great importance these towns sign wealth and england and france remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their dukes and rather than grand town halls for their religious the catholic church prevailed across europe this influencing not only faith but also wealth and bishops were appointed the church and often ruled virtual princes over large the early medieval periods had seen rapid growth with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence foremost were the benedictines whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others part their influence was that they tended build within unlike the cistercians whose ruined abbeys are seen the remote the cluniac and cistercian orders were prevalent the great monastery cluny having established formula for well planned monastic site which was then influence all subsequent monastic building for many the century francis assisi established the franciscans called grey mendicant the dominicans another mendicant order founded during the same period but dominic toulouse and bologna were particularly influential the building gothic geographic from the the romanesque architecture had become european style and manner affecting buildings countries far apart croatia sweden and the same wide geographic area was then affected the development gothic but the acceptance the gothic style and methods construction differed from place did the expressions gothic the proximity some regions meant that modern country borders not define divisions the other some regions such england and spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen except where they have been carried itinerant the transfer regional differences that are apparent the great abbey churches and cathedrals the romanesque period often become even more apparent the the local availability materials affected both construction and limestone was readily available several the very fine white limestone caen being favoured for sculptural england had coarse limestone and red sandstone well dark green purbeck marble which was often used for architectural northern netherlands northern denmark and the baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was strong tradition building the resultant brick gothic called backsteingotik germany and scandinavia and associated with the hanseatic stone was used for but brick was preferred for other because the extensive and varied deposits many buildings were faced were left with undecorated ade that this might achieved later the availability timber also influenced the style with timber buildings prevailing availability timber affected methods roof construction across thought that the magnificent hammer beam roofs england were devised direct response the lack long straight seasoned timber the end the medieval when forests had been decimated not only for the construction vast roofs but also for ship architectural background gothic architecture grew out the previous architectural romanesque for the most there was not clean there was later renaissance florence with the revival the classical style filippo brunelleschi the early and the sudden abandonment renaissance italy both the style and the structural characteristics romanesque tradition the romanesque architecture termed norman architecture england because its association with the norman invasion was established throughout europe and provided the basic architectural forms and units that were remain evolution throughout the medieval the important categories the cathedral church the parish the monastery the castle the palace the great hall the gatehouse the civic had been established the romanesque many architectural features that are associated with gothic architecture had been developed and used the architects romanesque these include ribbed vaults buttresses clustered ambulatories wheel windows spires and richly carved door these were already features ecclesiastical architecture before the development the gothic and all were develop increasingly elaborate was principally the widespread introduction single the pointed which was bring about the change that separates gothic from the technological change permitted stylistic change which broke the tradition massive masonry and solid walls penetrated small replacing with style where light appears triumph over with its use came the development many other architectural previously put the test scattered buildings and then called into service meet the aesthetic and ideological needs the new these include the flying pinnacles and traceried windows which typify gothic ecclesiastical but while pointed arch strongly associated with the gothic was first used western architecture buildings that were other ways clearly notably durham cathedral the north monreale cathedral and cathedral autun cathedral possible islamic influence delal bridge monreale cathedral the pointed one the defining attributes was earlier incorporated into islamic architecture following the islamic conquests roman syria and the sassanid empire the seventh the pointed arch and its precursors had been employed late roman and sassanian architecture within the roman evidenced early church building syria and occasional secular like the roman karamagara sassanid the parabolic and pointed arches employed palace and sacred increasing military and cultural contacts with the muslim including the norman conquest islamic sicily the crusades beginning and the islamic presence spain may have influenced medieval adoption the pointed although this point remains certainly those parts the western mediterranean subject islamic control rich regional variants fusing romanesque and later gothic traditions with islamic decorative for monreale and cefal cathedrals the alc zar seville and teruel cathedral architectural development transition from romanesque gothic architecture the characteristic forms that were define gothic architecture grew out romanesque architecture and developed several different geographic the result different influences and structural while barrel vaults and groin vaults are typical romanesque ribbed vaults were used the naves two romanesque churches abbey tienne and abbaye aux dames another early example the nave and apse area the cathedral the ribbed vault over the north transept durham cathedral england are probably still durham the pointed arches the nave were used for the first time high other characteristics early gothic such vertical clustered compound plate tracery and groups narrow openings had evolved during the romanesque the west front ely cathedral exemplifies this internally the three tiered arrangement gallery and clerestory was interiors had become lighter with the insertion more and larger the basilica saint denis generally cited the first truly gothic however the distinction best reserved for the which the ambulatory remains noyon cathedral also saw the earliest completion rebuilding entire cathedral the new style from while using all those features that came known including pointed flying buttresses and ribbed the builders continued employ many the features and much the character romanesque architecture including headed arch throughout the varying the shape pointed where was functionally practical the abbey noyon notre dame paris and the eastern end canterbury cathedral simple cylindrical columns predominate over the gothic forms clustered columns and shafted wells cathedral commenced the eastern end was the first building which the designer broke free from romanesque the architect entirely dispensed with the round arch favour the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns favour piers composed clusters shafts which lead into the mouldings the the transepts and nave were continued adam locke the same style and completed about the character the building entirely wells cathedral thus considered the first truly gothic abbot suger abbey denis the eastern end the basilica church built abbot suger and completed often cited the first truly gothic draws together many architectural forms which had evolved from romanesque and typify the gothic suger friend and confidant the french louis and louis vii decided about rebuild the great church attached abbey which was also royal began with the west reconstructing the original carolingian ade with its single designed the ade denis echo the roman arch constantine with its part division and three large portals ease the problem the rose window the known example above the west portal the ade combines both round arches and pointed arches the gothic the completion the west front abbot suger moved the reconstruction the eastern leaving the carolingian nave designed choir that would suffused with achieve his his masons drew the several new features which evolved had been introduced romanesque the pointed the ribbed vault the ambulatory with radiating the clustered columns supporting ribs springing different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion large clerestory windows the new structure was finished and dedicated june the presence the the choir and west front the abbey denis both became the prototypes for further building the royal domain northern france and the duchy through the rule the angevin dynasty the new style was introduced england and spread throughout the low countries germany spain northern italy and sicily characteristics gothic cathedrals and great churches while many secular buildings exist from the late middle the buildings cathedrals and great churches that gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics the fullest gothic cathedral abbey was prior the generally the landmark building its rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted one more towers and pinnacles and perhaps tall spires these cathedrals were the skyscrapers that day and would have been the largest buildings far that europeans would ever have the architecture these gothic churches that unique combination existing technologies established the emergence new building those technologies were the ogival pointed arch the ribbed vault and the buttress the gothic when applied ecclesiastical building emphasizes verticality and this appearance was achieved the development certain architectural which together provided engineering the structural parts the building ceased its solid and became stone skeleton comprising clustered columns pointed ribbed vaults and flying buttresses cathedrals their cityscapes chartres cathedral lincoln cathedral florence cathedral plan most large gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are the latin cross cruciform plan with long nave making the body the transverse arm called the transept and beyond extension which may called the choir chancel there are several regional variations this the nave generally flanked either side usually but sometimes the nave generally considerably taller than the having clerestory windows which light the central gothic churches the germanic like stephen vienna often have nave and aisles similar height and are called hallenkirche the south france there often single wide nave and marie saint comminges some churches with double like notre paris the transept does not project beyond the english cathedrals transepts tend project boldly and there may two salisbury cathedral though this not the case with lesser the eastern arm shows considerable england generally long and may have two distinct both choir and often square ended has projecting lady chapel dedicated the virgin mary france the eastern end often polygonal and surrounded walkway called ambulatory and sometimes ring chapels called chevet while german churches are often similar those the eastern projection beyond the transept usually just shallow apsidal chapel containing the florence cathedral structure the pointed arch history blind arcading canterbury cathedral one the defining characteristics gothic architecture the pointed ogival arch arches similar type were used the near east islamic well islamic architecture before they were structurally employed medieval thought some architectural historians that this was the inspiration for the use the pointed arch otherwise romanesque autun cathedral contrary the diffusionist appears that there was simultaneously structural evolution towards the pointed for the purpose vaulting spaces irregular bring transverse vaults the same height diagonal this latter occurs durham cathedral the nave aisles pointed arches also occur extensively romanesque decorative blind where circular arches overlap each other simple decorative and the points are accidental the functions the gothic vault unlike the circular vault roman and romanesque can used roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such trapezoids the other structural advantage that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers columns steep this enabled architects raise vaults much higher than was possible romanesque while structurally use the pointed arch gave greater flexibility architectural also gave gothic architecture very different and more vertical visual character than gothic architecture the pointed arch used every location where vaulted shape called both structural and gothic openings such windows arcades and galleries have pointed gothic vaulting above spaces both large and small usually supported richly moulded rows pointed arches upon delicate shafts form typical wall decoration known blind niches with pointed arches and containing statuary are major external the pointed arch lent itself elaborate intersecting shapes which developed within window spaces into complex gothic tracery forming the structural support the large windows that are characteristic the salisbury cathedral height characteristic gothic church architecture its both absolute and proportion its the verticality suggesting aspiration section the main body gothic church usually shows the nave considerably taller than england the proportion sometimes greater than while the greatest proportional difference achieved cologne cathedral with ratio the highest internal vault beauvais cathedral metres externally towers and spires are characteristic gothic churches both great and the number and positioning being one the greatest variables gothic the almost always detached from the florence cathedral and often from earlier france and two towers the front the germany and scandinavia this often the but english cathedral may also surmounted enormous tower the smaller churches usually have just one but this may also the case larger such salisbury cathedral ulm minster which has the tallest spire the slightly exceeding that lincoln cathedral the tallest which was actually completed during the medieval metres cologne cathedral vertical emphasis the pointed arch lends itself suggestion this appearance characteristically further enhanced both the architectural features and the decoration the the the verticality emphasised major way the towers and spires and lesser way strongly projecting vertical narrow columns called attached shafts which often pass through several storeys the long narrow vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and often the gable buttresses and other parts the building are often terminated small milan cathedral being extreme example the use this form the interior the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor ceiling and meet the ribs the like tall tree spreading into the verticals are generally repeated the treatment the windows and wall many gothic particularly and the perpendicular period english gothic architecture the treatment vertical elements gallery and window tracery creates strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions the interior sainte chapelle light one the most distinctive characteristics gothic architecture the expansive area the windows sainte chapelle and the very large size many individual york minster gloucester cathedral and milan cathedral the increase size between windows the romanesque and gothic periods related the use the ribbed and the pointed ribbed vault which channeled the weight supporting shaft with less outward thrust than semicircular walls did not need further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing the vault across the roof the aisle large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line the external these piers were often surmounted pinnacle statue further adding the downward and counteracting the outward thrust the vault and buttress arch well stress from wind the internal columns the arcade with their attached the ribs the vault and the flying with their associated vertical buttresses jutting angles the created stone between these the walls and the infill the vaults could lighter between the narrow the walls could opened into large through the gothic thanks the versatility the pointed the structure gothic windows developed from simple openings immensely rich and decorative sculptural the windows were very often filled with stained glass which added dimension colour the light within the well providing medium for figurative and narrative notre dame paris majesty the ade large church often referred the west front generally designed create powerful impression the approaching demonstrating both the might god and the might the institution that one the best known and most typical such ades that notre dame central the ade the main often flanked additional the arch the the tympanum often significant piece most frequently christ majesty and judgment day there central doorjamb trumeau then frequently bears statue the madonna and child there may much other often figures niches set into the mouldings around the sculptural screens extending across the above the main portal there generally large like that york minster group windows such those ripon cathedral france there generally rose window like that reims cathedral rose windows are also often found the ades churches spain and but are rarer elsewhere and are not found the ades any english the gable usually richly decorated with arcading sculpture the case may decorated with the rest the with polychrome marble and orvieto cathedral the west front french cathedral and many spanish and german cathedrals generally has two which particularly express enormous diversity form and however some german cathedrals have only one tower located the middle the ade such freiburg nster ripon cathedral basic shapes gothic arches and stylistic character the way which the pointed arch was drafted and utilised developed throughout the gothic there were fairly clear stages which did however progress the same the same way every moreover the names used define various periods styles within the gothic differs from country lancet arch the simplest shape the long opening with pointed arch known england the lancet openings are often usually cluster three lancet openings may very narrow and steeply lancet arches are typically defined centered arches whose radii are larger than the salisbury cathedral famous for the beauty and simplicity its lancet known england the early english york minster has group lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient they are known the five these simple undecorated grouped windows are found chartres and laon cathedrals and are used extensively italy york minster equilateral arch many gothic openings are based upon the equilateral form other when the arch the radius exactly the width the opening and the centre each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch this makes the arch higher relation its width than circular arch which exactly half high the equilateral arch gives wide opening satisfying proportion useful for decorative arcades and large the structural beauty the gothic arch however that set proportion had rigidly the equilateral arch was employed useful not principle this meant that narrower wider arches were introduced into building plan wherever necessity the architecture some italian notably venice semi circular arches are interspersed with pointed the equilateral arch lends itself filling with tracery simple circular and circular the type tracery that evolved fill these spaces known england geometric decorated gothic and can seen splendid effect many english and french notably lincoln and notre dame windows complex design and three more lights vertical are often designed overlapping two more equilateral flamboyant arch flamboyant limoges cathedral the flamboyant arch one that drafted from four the upper part each main arc turning upwards into smaller arc and meeting flame like these arches create rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface the form structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within larger and more stable not employed all for vaulting some the most beautiful and famous traceried windows europe employ this type can seen vienna sainte chapelle the cathedrals limoges and rouen and milan cathedral england the most famous examples are the west window york minster with its design based the sacred heart the extraordinarily rich light east window carlisle cathedral and the exquisite east window selby abbey doorways surmounted flamboyant mouldings are very common both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture they are much rarer notable example the doorway the chapter room rochester cathedral the style was much used england for wall arcading and prime examples are the lady chapel ely the screen lincoln and externally the ade exeter cathedral german and spanish gothic architecture often appears openwork screens the exterior the style was used rich and sometimes extraordinary effect both these notably the famous pulpit vienna cathedral vaulting college chapel depressed arch the depressed centred arch much wider than its height and gives the visual effect having been flattened under its structure achieved drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point small radius and then turn into two arches with wide radius and much lower springing this type when employed window lends itself very wide provided adequately supported many narrow vertical these are often further braced horizontal the overall effect produces like appearance delicate rectangular forms with emphasis the also employed wall decoration which arcade and window openings form part the whole decorative the known perpendicular that evolved from this treatment specific although very similar contemporary spanish style and was employed great effect through the century and first half the renaissance styles were much slower arrive england than italy and can seen notably the east end gloucester cathedral where the east window said large tennis there are three very famous royal chapels and one like abbey which show the style its most king college chapel cambridge windsor henry chapel westminster abbey and bath abbey however very many simpler especially churches built during the wool boom east anglia are fine examples the symbolism and ornamentation the royal portal chartres cathedral cathedral architecture western europe poor bible the gothic cathedral represented the universe microcosm and each architectural including the loftiness and huge dimensions the were intended convey theological the great glory the building becomes microcosm two firstly the mathematical and geometrical nature the construction image the orderly which underlying rationality and logic can secondly the statues sculptural stained glass and murals incorporate the essence creation depictions the labours the months and the zodiac and sacred history from the old and new testaments and lives the well reference the eternal the last judgment and coronation the virgin foolish virgins strasbourg the decorative schemes usually incorporated biblical stories emphasizing visual typological allegories between old testament prophecy and the new testament many churches were very richly both inside and sculpture and architectural details were often bright with coloured paint which traces remain the cathedral chartres wooden ceilings and panelling were usually brightly sometimes the stone columns the nave were and the panels decorative wall arcading contained narratives figures these have rarely remained but may seen the chapterhouse westminster abbey some important gothic churches could severely simple such the basilica mary magdalene saint maximin provence where the local traditions the massive romanesque architecture were still regional differences amiens cathedral architecture cathedrals and great churches wherever gothic architecture subject local and frequently the influence itinerant stonemasons and carrying ideas between cities and sometimes between certain characteristics are typical particular regions and often override the style appearing buildings hundreds years france french gothic architecture the distinctive characteristic french and those germany and belgium that were strongly influenced their height and their impression each french cathedral tends stylistically unified appearance when compared with english cathedral where there great diversity almost every they are with slight projection the transepts and subsidiary the west fronts are highly having three portals surmounted rose and two large sometimes there are additional towers the transept the east end polygonal with ambulatory and sometimes chevette radiating the south many the major churches are without transepts and some are without wells england english gothic architecture the distinctive characteristic english cathedrals their extreme and their internal emphasis upon the which may emphasised visually much more than the vertical each english cathedral with the exception has extraordinary degree stylistic when compared with most german and italian not unusual for every part the building have been built different century and different with attempt creating stylistic unlike french english cathedrals sprawl across their with double transepts projecting strongly and lady chapels tacked later the west the doors are not significant the usual congregational entrance being through side the west window very large and never which are reserved for the transept the west front may have two towers like french there nearly always tower the crossing and may very large and surmounted the distinctive english east end but may take completely different both internally and the stonework often richly decorated with particularly the regensburg cathedral germany and central europe czech gothic architecture romanesque architecture poland czechia and austria characterised its massive and modular this expressed the gothic architecture central europe the huge size the towers and often but not always the west front generally follows the french but the towers are very much taller are surmounted enormous openwork spires that are regional because the size the the section the ade between them may appear narrow and the eastern end follows the french the distinctive character the interior german gothic cathedrals their breadth and this the case even they have been modelled upon french german like the tend not have strongly projecting there are also many hall churches hallenkirchen without clerestory barcelona cathedral spain and portugal spanish gothic architecture portuguese gothic architecture the distinctive characteristic gothic cathedrals the iberian peninsula their spatial with many areas different shapes leading from each they are comparatively and often have very tall arcades surmounted low giving similar spacious appearance the hallenkirche the church the batalha monastery many the cathedrals are completely surrounded like english each often stylistically this expresses itself both the addition chapels and the application decorative details drawn from different among the influences both decoration and form are islamic architecture and towards the end the renaissance details combined with the gothic distinctive the west leon cathedral typically resembles french west but wider proportion height and often with greater diversity detail and combination intricate ornament with broad plain burgos cathedral there are spires german the roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few there are often towers and domes great variety shapes and structural invention rising above the italy florence cathedral italian gothic architecture the distinctive characteristic italian gothic the use polychrome both externally marble veneer the brick ade and also internally where the arches are often made alternating black and white and where the columns may painted the walls decorated with frescoes and the apse with the plan usually regular and with the exception milan cathedral which germanic italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced the proportions are generally mathematically based the square and the concept armon and except venice where they loved flamboyant the arches are almost always colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending italian cathedral ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics the lunettes over the the ades have projecting open porches and occular wheel windows rather than and not usually have the crossing usually surmounted there often standing tower and the eastern end usually has apse comparatively low the windows are not large northern europe although stained glass windows are often the favourite narrative medium for the interior the fresco other gothic buildings gothic secular and domestic architecture see also castle palais des papes commonly built the prevailing architectural style the period and country where they are were built the gothic

complete large royal with partial survivals the great hall the palace westminster london century hall renovated the late century with gothic windows and wooden hammerbeam roof and the famous conciergerie former palace the kings addition monumental secular examples the gothic style can seen surviving medieval portions cities across above all the distinctive venetian gothic such the oro the house the wealthy early century merchant jacques coeur bourges the classic gothic bourgeois full the asymmetry and complicated detail beloved the gothic collegium maius poland town hall poland other cities with concentration secular gothic include bruges and siena most surviving small secular buildings are relatively plain and most windows are topped with mullions with pointed arches and vaulted ceilings often only found few focal the houses the nobility were slow abandon the appearance being even parts like where defence had ceased real the living and working parts many monastic buildings for example mont michel there are many excellent examples secular brick gothic structures scattered throughout poland and the baltic most notably malbork castle the gda and wroc town and collegium
