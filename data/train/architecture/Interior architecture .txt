established its first subsequent iterations the interior may not and for obvious older structures are often modified designers different generation according changing needs our cities this process often semanticizes the building and predicated the notion that buildings can never really complete and altered building may look the same the but its interior may completely different the interior architect must therefore sensitive not only the place the building its physical and political but the temporal requirements changing owners and this the building has good the original architectural idea therefore the first iteration internal spatial hierarchy for that after which others are bound follow cities are now dense with such perhaps originally built banks that are now perhaps industrial mills that are now loft even railway stations that have become art each case the collective memory the shape and character the city generally held more desirable than the possibility new building the same although clearly economic forces also possible speculate that there might well further new interiors for these structures future but for each alteration the technical and technological expertise the era will determine the extent which the building modified its building life cycle certain interiors remain unaltered over time due historic unchanged financial nevertheless most buildings have only three possible range internal first designated significantly important maintain visually only accommodating unseen modern access and structural and restoration second demolished make way for new building the same becoming finally redesigned and altered accommodate new there are many different degrees alteration minor one enable the building conform new legal codes likely prolong the first indeed iteration interior but major such the retention only the all intents and purposes new all possibilities within and between the two extremes are the domain the interior the practice architecture

may the middle percent earned between and the lowest percent earned less than and the highest percent earned more than those just starting their internships can expect earn considerably earnings partners established architectural firms may fluctuate because changing business some architects may have difficulty establishing their own practices and may through period when their expenses are greater than their requiring substantial financial many firms pay tuition and fees toward continuing education requirements for their education purpose education interior architecture should include the study historic architectural and design building codes and preserving and restoring old drawing plans original and building physical and virtual models the field interior architecture has lot common with interior design and however typically focuses architecture and students both fields learn design safe and useful indoor from downtown penthouses high school student interior architecture will learn about much more than artistic such choosing which style furnishings works well loft like study will also include information technical such seismic retrofitting making old buildings safe
