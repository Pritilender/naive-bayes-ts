architecture	organizational architecture organization design navigation search organizational architecture has two very different one sense literally refers the organization its built environment and another sense refers architecture structure which fleshes out the organizational architecture organizational space the influence the spatial environment humans and around organizational architecture organization design the creation processes and formal reporting relationships organizational space describes the influence the spatial environment the health the mind and the behavior humans and around organizations area research which interdisciplinarity central draws from management organization and architecture dale added with knowledge for environmental psychology social medicine spatial science may regarded special field expertise organization studies and change management applied this perspective organizational architecture elaborated organizational space organization design architecture organization metaphor provides the framework through which organization aims realize its core qualities specified its vision statement provides the infrastructure into which business processes are deployed and ensures that the core qualities are realized across the business processes deployed within the this way organizations aim consistently realize their core qualities across

management see also references further reading content according most authors organizational architecture like traditional architecture shapes the organizational some authors would say the space where life will take also represents concept which implies connection between the organizational structure with other systems inside the organization order create unique synergistic system which will more than just the sum its conventionally organizational architecture consists the formal organization organizational structure informal organization organizational culture business processes strategy and the most important human resources because what organization not system the table shows some approaches organizational the goal organizational architecture create organization which will able continuously create value for present and future optimizing and organizing some under organizational architecture understand building blocks which are mandatory for the growth the design organization means set stage where the drama life will take design organization design can defined the process reshaping organization structure and can more effectively defined the alignment process rewards metrics and talent with the strategy the jay galbraith and amy kates have made the case persuasively building years work that attention all these organizational elements necessary create new capabilities compete given this systemic often referred the star approach more likely lead better organization design may involve strategic but properly viewed path effective strategy the design process nearly always entails making offs one set structural benefits against many companies fall into the trap making repeated changes organization with little benefit the this often occurs because changes structure are relatively easy execute while creating the impression that something substantial this often leads cynicism and confusion within the more powerful change happens when there are clear design objectives driven new business strategy forces the market that require different approach organizing the organization design process often defined phase one the definition business including clear picture strategy and design this step typically followed strategic decisions which will define the fundamental architecture the organization essentially deciding which major roles will report the top the the classic options for strategic grouping are organize behavior function product category customer market geography matrix each the basic building block options for strategic grouping brings set benefits and such generic pros and however are not the basis for choosing the best strategic analysis must done completed relative specific business subsequent phases organization design include operational design roles measures and reward followed staffing and other implementation the field somewhat specialized nature and many large and small consulting firms offer organization design assistance some companies attempt establish internal staff resources aimed supporting organization design there substantial body literature the arguably starting with the work peter drucker his examination general motors decades other key thinkers built including galbraith nadler and lawrence lorsch organization design can considered subset the broader field organization effectiveness and organization both which may entail more behaviorally focused solutions such leadership team effectiveness and the many organizational experts argue for integrated approach these including effective talent management there are various approaches organizational architecture including kenneth mackenzie david nadler michael organizational architecture david marc gerstein and robert shaw designing organizations using the star model developed jay galbraith layered model the organizational adaption model raymond miles and charles snow richard burton rge obel richard daft ralph kilmann the tricord model designing organisations from whole systems perspective characteristics effective organizational design some systems are effective and efficient whereas others are successful systems may attributable the skill exercised designing the system the quality management practised during successful systems are characterized their flexibility reliability economy and simplicity flexibility and reliability tend function whereas economy and acceptability pertain both design and numerous relationships exist among these for simplicity will affect economy and possibly moreover management must reach compromise between economy and and between technical efficiency and organizational the balance reached will determine whether run objectives are simplicity effective organizational system need not the simplicity design extremely desirable consider the task communicating information about the operation system and the allocation its the task not difficult when components are few and the relationships among them are however the problems communication multiply with each successive stage the proper method for maintaining simplicity use precise definitions and outline the specific task for each total systems often become complex because the sheer size and nature but effectiveness and efficiency may still achieved each subsystem maintains its flexibility conditions change and managers should prepared adjust operations there are two ways adjust changing operating design new systems modify operating existing system should not modified accommodate change but every system should sufficiently flexible integrate changes that may occur either the environment the nature the for company should not use the same system build missiles uses build nor the same system sell insurance the one originally designed sell however should possible modify existing system produce different varieties types the same product practical system must well designed but cannot entirely there will always minor variations from the general and system should able adapt such changes without excessive the advantages associated with having flexible system will become more apparent when consider the difficulty administering reliability system reliability important factor reliability the consistency with which operations are and may vary from zero output complete breakdown work constant predictable the typical system operates somewhere between these two the characteristics reliability can designed into the system carefully selecting and arranging the operating the system more reliable than its weakest when the requirements for particular component such operator having unique skills are may worthwhile maintain standby all provisions should made for quick repair replacement when failure one valid approach the maintenance relationship use form construction that permits repair replacing complete some television for common practice replace entire section the network rather than try find the faulty reliability not critical issue when prompt repair and recovery can economy effective system not necessarily economical system for the postal service may keep schedule with mail deliveries but only hiring large number additional this the efficiency the postal system would another inventories may controlled using comprehensive system however the cost the storekeeping were greater than the potential savings from this degree the system would not often dysfunctional and expensive develop much greater capacity for one segment system than for some other building redundancy providing for every contingency usually neutralizes the operating efficiency the when objectives include achieving particular task the lowest possible there must some degree off between effectiveness and when objective perform certain mission regardless there can acceptability any matter how well will not function properly unless accepted the people who operate the participants not believe will benefit are opposed are pressured into using think not good will not work system not two things can the system will modified gradually the people who are using the system will used ineffectively and ultimately unplanned alterations elaborate system can nullify advantages associated with using the differentiation and integration basic consideration the design organizations dividing work into reasonable tasks while giving simultaneous attention coordinating these activities and unifying their results into meaningful whole two guidelines may followed grouping units that have similar orientations and tasks should grouped they can reinforce each common concern and the arrangement will simplify the coordinating task common units required integrate their activities closely should grouped the common manager can coordinate them through the formal when units neither have similar orientations nor share their the task grouping becomes more for when units are similar nature and function but are also relatively the manager must base his decision the most appropriate way group activities according his past difficult task associated with subsystem determination establish proper boundaries the more specific and distinct the goals the the easier set other factors such the influence the the availability men and the time schedule for design and operation the cost alternative and the particular biases the designers must considered when establishing the role management designers with imagination have the best chance group people and machines into workable combinations having the greatest efficiency and effectiveness within the recognized certain characteristics should designed into effective and efficient system simplicity flexibility reliability economy and this the designer must determine what has done achieve the stated and how the total task can divided into meaningful the many possible one must selected that which satisfies the decision criteria better than the other the balance between technical efficiency and the human factors that determine organizational climate should included making this the eventual success failure the project somewhat predetermined attitude and the relationship between the designers and those who must implement the the systems approach suggests new role for the traditional the manager operated highly rigid system having defined goals clear cut tight and hierarchical information the flexible systems the organization not static but continually evolving meet both external and internal the role develop viable cope with and help participants establish dynamic leonard sayles has expressed the problem the one enduring objective the effort build and maintain reciprocating system the behavioral patterns which stay within reasonable physical but this seeking moving since the parameters the system the division labor and the are evolving and thus the manager endeavors introduce regularity world that will never allow him achieve the ideal the systems approach does not offer prescription for making difficult and complex job rather helps him understand and operate more effectively within the reality complex the systems approach suggests that operations cannot neatly departmentalized but must viewed overlapping suggests that leadership patterns must particularly when dealing with professionals and highly trained and motivation must take the form willing participation rather than forceful systems design involves establishing project and facilitating subsystems accomplish certain tasks this the network human independence required accomplish given task based the shared responsibility all members the the traditional organization geared functional performance and the integrating force instead gearing participant activities obedience rules and closely structured the systems approach provides basis for active cooperation meeting task the manager looked upon resource person who can help the group meet its goals and also source authority and thus systems theory lends structure which the concepts leadership and participation can applied effectively within the implementation implicit the connotation systems otherwise would nothing more than empty follows that the interface between managers and systems designers and mutual understanding must fostered maximize returns from design the system must tailored the needs the organization and adapted continually circumstances general managers engage systems design day basis when they plan activities and organize systems accomplish specialized staff groups have evolved perform tasks such range organizational and systems however since managers are ultimately responsible for organizational they should make special effort help ensure the development useful systems and make design activities extension the role rather than separate operating managers need understand the organizational making requirements and the information needed support the although the probability success implementation enhanced considerably management vitally interested the technical expertise and motivation for change are more likely found staff the solution the apparent dichotomy would seem team with specialists supporting operating managers who are responsible for the manager might devote either time such effort time the task requires project involving integrated system for the entire company might well require years operating people are delegated responsibility and authority for such particularly they are delegated the authority outline they should also maintain sufficient contact with the day operations and its attendant information flow retain their expertise for decision the environment dynamic internal capabilities undergo might wise rotate people from operations systems design that operating expertise updated see also organizational design organizational structure departmentalization
