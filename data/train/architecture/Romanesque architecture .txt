its learning and technology the building masonry domes and the carving decorative architectural details continued though greatly evolved style since the fall the enduring byzantine empire the domed churches constantinople and eastern europe were greatly affect the architecture certain particularly through trade and through the crusades the most notable single building that demonstrates this basilica venice but there are many known particularly such the church saint front rigueux and angoul cathedral much europe was affected feudalism which peasants held tenure from local rulers over the land that they farmed exchange for military service the result this was that they could called not only for local and regional but follow their lord travel across europe the they were required the crusades brought about very large movement people with ideas and trade particularly those involved the building fortifications and the metal working needed for the provision which was also applied the fitting and decoration the continual movement rulers nobles bishops abbots craftsmen and was important factor creating homogeneity building methods and recognizable romanesque style despite regional life became generally less secure after the carolingian this resulted the building castles strategic many them being constructed strongholds the descendants the vikings who invaded northern france under rollo political struggles also resulted the fortification many the rebuilding and strengthening walls that remained from the roman one the most notable surviving fortifications that the city carcassonne the enclosure towns brought about lack living space within the and resulted style town house that was tall and often surrounding communal san gimignano tuscany the holy roman emperors

architectural innovation castello venere erice one many built the normans sicily italy many such san gimignano were enclosed with causing crowding and the building tower religion across the late and centuries saw unprecedented growth the number great number these both large and remain some almost intact and others altered almost beyond recognition later they include many very well known churches such santa maria cosmedin the baptistery florence and san zeno maggiore the famous abbeys aux dames and les hommes caen and mont michel date from this well the abbeys the pilgrimage route santiago compostela many cathedrals owe their foundation this with others beginning abbey and later becoming the cathedrals ancient all were begun this period with the exception where the monks relocated from the norman church old sarum and such canterbury which were rebuilt the site saxon the most famous church the period santiago compostela the rhine and its tributaries were the location many romanesque notably mainz worms speyer and bamberg cologne then the largest city north the very important group large city churches survives largely monasticism spread across romanesque churches sprang scandinavia poland hungary sicily serbia and several important romanesque churches were built the crusader kingdoms monasticism the system monasticism which the religious become members with common ties and common living mutually dependent rather than group hermits living proximity but essentially was established the monk benedict the the benedictine monasteries spread from italy throughout being always far the most numerous they were followed the cluniac order the cistercians carthusians and augustinian canons during the crusades the military orders the knights hospitaller and the knights templar were the which sometimes also functioned and the cathedrals that had bodies secular clergy often living were major source power bishops and the abbots important monasteries lived and functioned like the monasteries were the major seats learning all benedict had ordered that all the arts were taught and practiced the within the monasteries books were transcribed and few people outside the monasteries could read burgundy was the centre the enormous and powerful monastery cluny was have lasting effect the layout other monasteries and the design their unfortunately very little the abbey church cluny the cluny rebuilding onwards has completely but have good idea the design cluny from which until the renaissance remained the largest building however the church sernin toulouse has remained intact and demonstrates the regularity romanesque design with its modular its massive appearance and the repetition the simple arched window types churches many parish churches across such this vestre slidre norway are romanesque foundation the romanesque nanque abbey church and surrounding monastic gordes provence france collegiate churches such that saint hadelin celles belgium

typical the churches that were founded the pilgrim pilgrimage and crusade the church the holy sepulchre jerusalem major pilgrimage site from the century its rotunda inspired the construction many romanesque circular like many castles built crusader knights the inner fortress krak des chevaliers syria was mainly constructed this with the outer walls being the abbey saint conques france was one many such abbeys built along the pilgrimage way james that led santiago compostela the plan the church saint rigueux france was influenced byzantine architecture seen the and has five characteristics list regional characteristics romanesque churches the general impression given romanesque both ecclesiastical and secular one massive solidity and contrast with both the preceding roman and later gothic architecture which the bearing structural members appear columns pilasters and romanesque common with byzantine architecture relies upon its sections walls called romanesque architecture often divided into two periods known the first romanesque style and the romanesque style the difference chiefly matter the expertise with which the buildings were the first romanesque employed rubble smaller windows and unvaulted greater refinement marks the second along with increased use the vault and dressed walls the walls romanesque buildings are often massive thickness with few and comparatively small they are often double filled with the building material differs greatly across depending upon the local stone and building poland much germany and parts the brick generally other areas saw extensive use granite and the building stone was often used comparatively small and irregular bedded thick smooth ashlar masonry was not distinguishing feature the particularly the earlier part the but occurred chiefly where easily worked limestone was buttresses because the massive nature romanesque buttresses are not highly significant they are gothic romanesque buttresses are generally flat square profile and not project great deal beyond the the case aisled barrel barrel vaults over the aisles helped buttress the was the cases where barrel vaults were they effectively became like flying buttresses often aisles extended through two rather than the one usual gothic better support the weight vaulted the case durham flying buttresses have been but are hidden inside the triforium walls and buttresses the monastery san vittore alle chiuse genga italy undressed has typically like appearance with small windows early castle rising england shows flat buttresses and reinforcing the corners the building typical both castles and abbaye cerisy normandy france has compact appearance with aisles rising through two storeys buttressing the albans cathedral england demonstrates the typical alterations made the fabric many romanesque buildings different styles and materials arches and openings the arches used romanesque architecture are nearly always for openings such doors and for vaults and for wide doorways are usually surmounted circular except where door with lintel set into large arched recess and surmounted circular lunette with decorative these doors sometimes have carved central narrow doors and small windows might surmounted solid stone larger openings are nearly always characteristic feature romanesque both ecclesiastic and the pairing two arched windows arcade separated pillar colonette and often set within larger ocular windows are common particularly the facade gable and are also seen later romanesque churches may have wheel windows rose windows with plate tracery there are very small number buildings the romanesque such autun cathedral france and monreale cathedral sicily which pointed arches have been used apparently for stylistic believed that these cases there direct imitation islamic architecture other late romanesque churches such durham cathedral and cefal cathedral the pointed arch was introduced structural device ribbed its increasing application was fundamental the development gothic architecture arcades arcade row supported piers they occur the interior large separating the nave from the and large secular interiors such the great hall supporting the timbers roof upper arcades also occur cloisters and enclosing open arcades can occur storeys while the arcade cloister typically single the arcade that divides the nave and aisles church typically two with third stage window openings known the clerestory rising above arcading large scale generally fulfils structural but also generally smaller decorative both internally and externally where frequently blind arcading with only wall narrow passage behind openings and arcades the atrium and arcaded narthex milan italy harmonious composition similar the facade notre dame puy puy france has more complex arrangement diversified doors varying blind windows and open collegiate church saint nivelles belgium uses fine shafts belgian marble define alternating blind openings and upper windows are similarly separated into two openings worms cathedral germany displays great variety openings and arcades including wheel and rose many small simple galleries and lombard the south portal the abbey moissac france has square door divided ornate surmounted carved tympanum and set within vast arched piers romanesque piers were often employed support they were built masonry and square rectangular generally having horizontal moulding representing capital the springing the sometimes piers have vertical shafts attached and may also have horizontal mouldings the level the although basically piers can often highly complex with segments large core columns the inner surface supporting the clustered group smaller shafts leading into the mouldings the piers that occur the intersection two large such those under the crossing the nave and are commonly cruciform each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier right angles the columns columns are important structural feature romanesque colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for monolithic columns cut from single piece stone were frequently used they had been roman and early christian they were also particularly when they alternated between more massive arcades columns cut from single pieces are also common structures that not bear massive weights such where they are sometimes salvaged columns during this great number antique roman columns were salvaged and reused the interiors and the porticos the most durable these columns are marble and have the stone horizontally the majority are vertically bedded and are sometimes variety they may have retained their original roman generally the corinthian roman composite style some like santa maria cosmedin and the atrium san clemente may have odd assortment columns which large capitals are placed short columns and small capitals are placed taller columns even the architectural compromises this type are seen where materials have been salvaged from number salvaged columns were also used lesser extent drum columns most parts romanesque columns were they supported thick upper walls with small and sometimes heavy the most common method construction was build them out stone cylinders called the crypt speyer cathedral hollow core columns where really massive columns were called such those durham cathedral they were constructed ashlar masonry and the hollow core was filled with these huge untapered columns are sometimes ornamented with incised alternation common characteristic romanesque occurring both churches and the arcades that separate large interior spaces the alternation piers and the most simple form that this takes have column between each adjoining sometimes the columns are multiples two michael hildesheim alternation occurs the nave while alternation can seen the jumi ges there are tall drum columns between piers each which has column supporting the there are many variations this most notably durham cathedral where the mouldings and shafts the piers are exceptional richness and the huge masonry columns are deeply incised with geometric often the arrangement was made more complex the complexity the piers that was not piers and columns that but piers entirely different form from each such those sant ambrogio milan where the nature the vault dictated that the alternate piers bore great deal more weight than the intermediate ones and are thus very much piers and columns hildesheim shows two columns set between the mainz cathedral germany has rectangular piers and possibly the earliest example internal elevation stages malmesbury abbey england has hollow core probably filled with the cathedral santiago compostela spain has large drum columns with attached shafts supporting barrel durham cathedral england has decorated masonry columns alternating with piers clustered shafts supporting the earliest pointed high capitals the foliate corinthian style provided the inspiration for many romanesque and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much the availability original those italian churches such pisa cathedral church sant alessandro lucca and southern france being much closer the classical than those the corinthian capital essentially round the bottom where sits circular column and square the where supports the wall this form capital was maintained the general proportions and outline the romanesque this was achieved most simply cutting rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off angle that the block was square the but octagonal the can seen michael this shape lent itself wide variety superficial sometimes foliate imitation the but often northern europe the foliate capitals generally bear far more resemblance the intricacies manuscript illumination than classical parts france and italy there are strong links the pierced capitals byzantine architecture the figurative capitals that the greatest originality while some are dependent manuscripts illustrations biblical scenes and depictions beasts and others are lively scenes the legends local the while retaining the form square top and round were often compressed into little more than bulging this particularly the case large masonry large columns that alternate with piers capital corinthian form with anthropomorphised pisa campanile capital corinthian form with byzantine decoration and carved san tours mista palencia capital simplified concave corinthian form with billeted simple dosseret and pronounced church santa san eda capital convex cubic form with its concave dosseret and cable decoration defined herina capitals this shape are often decorated with barbaric carvings and mythical capital amorphous form surmounting cluster the figurative carving shows winged devil directing herod slaughter the monastery san juan duero soria capital retaining corinthian form decorated with intertwined beasts derived from irish manuscripts grande sauve abbey france vaults and roofs the majority buildings have wooden generally simple truss tie beam king post form the case trussed rafter they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings three sections like those that survive ely and peterborough cathedrals typically the aisles are but the nave roofed with the case both peterborough and italy where open wooden roofs are and tie beams frequently occur conjunction with the timbers have often been decorated san miniato monte florence vaults stone brick took several different forms and showed marked development during the evolving into the pointed ribbed arch characteristic gothic architecture barrel vault the simplest type vaulted roof the barrel vault which single arched surface extends from wall the length the space for the nave important which retains medieval the vault saint gartempe france the early however the barrel vault generally required the support solid walls which the windows were very groin vault groin vaults occur early romanesque notably speyer cathedral where the high vault about the first employment romanesque architecture this type vault for wide later buildings employing ribbed groin vaults are most frequently used for the less visible and smaller particularly crypts and groin vault almost always square plan and constructed two barrel vaults intersecting right unlike ribbed the entire arch structural groin vaults are frequently separated transverse arched ribs low profile speyer and santiago compostela sainte marie zelay the ribs are square strongly projecting and ribbed vault ribbed vaults came into general use the ribbed not only are there ribs spanning the vaulted area but each vaulted bay has diagonal following the same course the groins groin however whereas groin the vault itself the structural ribbed the ribs that are the structural and the spaces between them can filled with non structural because romanesque arches are nearly always the structural and design problem inherent the ribbed vault that the diagonal span larger and therefore higher than the transverse the romanesque builders used number solutions this one was have the centre point where the diagonal ribs met the highest with the infill all the surfaces sloping upwards towards domical this solution was employed italy san pavia and sant ambrogio milan the solution employed england was stilt the transverse maintaining horizontal central line the roof like that barrel the diagonal ribs could also solution used the sexpartite vaults both the abbaye hommes and abbaye dames france the late and early pointed arched vault the problems encountered the structure and appearance vaults was solved late the romanesque period with the introduction pointed arched ribs which allowed the height both diagonal and transverse ribs varied proportion each pointed ribs made their first appearance the transverse ribs the vaults durham cathedral northern dating from durham cathedral massive romanesque proportions and yet its builders introduced several structural features that were new architectural design and were later hallmark features the another gothic structural feature employed durham the flying buttress however these are hidden beneath the roofs the the earliest pointed vault france that the narthex zelay dating from they were subsequently employed with the development the
