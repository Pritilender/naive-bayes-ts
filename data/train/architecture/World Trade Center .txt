trade center ended following draft versions the new building the frame earlier introduced fazlur khan was new approach that allowed more open floor plans than the traditional design that distributed columns throughout the interior support building the world trade center towers used load bearing perimeter steel columns called vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely together form rigid wall supporting virtually all lateral loads such wind and sharing the gravity load with the core the perimeter structure containing columns per side was constructed with extensive use prefabricated modular each consisting three three stories connected spandrel plates the spandrel plates were welded the columns create the modular pieces site the fabrication adjacent modules were bolted together with the splices occurring span the columns and the spandrel plates were located each transmitting shear stress between allowing them work together resisting lateral the joints between modules were staggered that the column splices between adjacent modules were not the same the core the towers housed the elevator and utility restrooms three and other support the core each tower was rectangular area feet and contained steel columns running from the bedrock the top the the column free space between the perimeter and core was bridged prefabricated floor the floors supported their own weight well live loads providing lateral stability the exterior walls and distributing wind loads among the exterior the floors consisted inches thick lightweight concrete slabs laid fluted steel grid lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the the trusses connected the perimeter alternate columns and were foot inch centers the top chords the trusses were bolted seats welded the spandrels the exterior side and channel welded the core columns the interior the floors were connected the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers that helped reduce the amount sway felt building hat trusses outrigger located from the floor the top the buildings were designed support tall communication antenna top each only wtc north actually had antenna was added the truss system consisted six trusses along the long axis the core and four along the short this truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission the tube frame using steel core and perimeter columns protected with fire resistant created relatively lightweight structure that would sway more response the wind compared traditional such the empire state building that have heavy masonry for fireproofing steel structural during the design wind tunnel tests were done establish design wind pressures that the world trade center towers could subjected and structural response those experiments also were done evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably however many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill one the chief engineers leslie robertson worked with canadian engineer alan davenport develop viscoelastic dampers absorb some the these viscoelastic used throughout the structures the joints between floor trusses and perimeter
