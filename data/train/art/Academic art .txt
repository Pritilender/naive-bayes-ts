gustave courbet being based idealistic and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being another criticism realists was the false surface the objects depicted looked slick and showing real the realist odule ribot worked against this experimenting with unfinished textures his stylistically the impressionists who advocated quickly painting outdoors exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts criticized the finished and idealized painting although academic painters began painting first making drawings and then painting oil sketches their the high polish they gave their drawings seemed the impressionists tantamount after the oil the artist would produce the final painting with the academic changing the painting meet stylistic standards and attempting idealize the images and add perfect similarly perspective constructed geometrically flat surface and not really the product impressionists disavowed the devotion mechanical realists and impressionists also defied the placement life and landscape the bottom the hierarchy important note that most realists and impressionists and others among the early garde who rebelled against
