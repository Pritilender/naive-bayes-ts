advocated autonomous art history and promoted the separation art history from aesthetics thausing students franz wickhoff professor and alois riegl professor furthered his insofar they developed the methods comparative stylistic analysis and attempted avoid all judgements personal thus both contributed the revaluation the art late antiquity which before then had been despised period riegl avowed disciple positivism focused the purely formal qualities the work and rejected all arguments about content metaphysical other leading figures noted for formalist approach were heinrich lfflin and henri

culture historical archaeology processual archaeology and finally the rise post processual archaeology recent decades has anything increased the importance the study style formalism the century the century the formalist approach art history gradually but formalism became increasingly important the aesthetic theory current the post impressionist painter maurice denis wrote his article definition that painting was essentially flat surface covered colours arranged certain denis argued that the painting sculpture drawing not the subject the artistic gave pleasure the roger fry vision and design was early modernist critic apply formalist analysis contemporary denis emphasis the form work led the bloomsbury writer clive bell write his book art that there was distinction between actual form and its significant for recognition work art representational thing was less important than capturing the significant true inner bell pushed for art that used the techniques artistic medium capture the essence thing its significant rather than its mere outward throughout the rest the early part the european structuralists continued argue that art was expressive only ontological metaphysical essential nature but european art critics soon began using the word indicate new concept the and structuralists reasoned that the mental processes and social preconceptions individual brings art are more important than the nature the knowledge created only through socialization and they and thing can only known filtered through these mental soon the word was used interchangeably with the word the american art critic clement greenberg influential piece partisan review argued that the value art was located its which inseparable from its talk given clement greenberg western michigan january addressed the topic directly formalism was originally the name russian art and literary movement before the first world and then became used the bolsheviks for any kind art that was for its own became dirty word like art for which valid sometime the the word formalism came again the mouths and the pens people dare call and was made responsible for though the only and one these easy inferences that plague human was held that advocated certain way now written word favor certain kind painting that been made you only write about art already been professor link towards representational and the only kind can but had accept the fact that the major painting our and the major sculpture after was because you choose what like and what not say major because the difference between major and minor very became very important for this country the when the abstract expressionists finally decided they could compete with the french and stop being but rhetoric very otherwise have been misunderstood the extent have recognize that and put the blame entirely the people who misunderstood though still say written word that gives you reason think that for abstract against other kinds wrote piece called modernist that got taken program when was only and was thought believe things that was describing again was the fault was favor pure art spite the fact that put quotation marks around pure purity whenever used because believe any such thing pure was was necessary apparently for modernist artists and helped produce some great art and some great necessary illusion for say and for and maybe even for ezra was necessary illusion for picasso and for there such thing pure pure pure anyhow believe there such but made the mistake contenting myself with quotation marks and not saying believe this simply and people assumed that was been describing what thought had happened under and nothing more and nothing was also inferred that had said there was some necessity working this although said nothing that but blame should have been more formalism today the concept formalism art continued evolve through the some art critics argue for return the platonic definition for form collection elements which falsely represent the thing itself and which are mediated art and mental second view argues that representational elements must somewhat but must still aim capture the third view argues for discursive ontological instead structuralists focused how the creation art communicates the idea behind the whereas formalists manipulated elements within structuralists purposely mixed media and included context element the artistic whereas focus was the aesthetic structuralists played down response favor structuralism focus the art reaches far back the work marcel duchamp many structuralism
