views when the medieval period begins during this both terms general history and specifically art but most often placed late the the course the century christianity went from being persecuted popular sect the official religion the adapting existing roman styles and often iconography from both popular and imperial from the start the period the main survivals christian art are the paintings popular styles the catacombs rome but the end there were number lavish mosaics churches built under imperial over this period imperial late roman art went through strikingly baroque phase and then largely abandoned classical style and greek realism favour more mystical and hieratic process that was well underway before christianity became major influence imperial influences from eastern parts the egypt
