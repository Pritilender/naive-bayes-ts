venus similar description the event description sculpture the poem angelo poliziano the stanze per single text provides the precise imagery the however which has led scholars propose many sources and art historians who specialize the italian renaissance have found neoplatonic interpretation which was most clearly articulated ernst the most enduring way understand the botticelli represented the neoplatonic idea divine love the form nude smarthistory botticelli birth venus for plato and for the members the florentine platonic academy venus had two she was earthly goddess who aroused humans physical love she was heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love plato further argued that contemplation physical beauty allowed the mind better understand spiritual looking the most beautiful might first raise physical response viewers which then lifted their minds towards the neoplatonic reading birth venus suggests that century viewers would have looked the painting and felt their minds lifted the realm divine more questions have arisen about neoplatonism the dominant intellectual system late century and scholars have indicated that there might other ways interpret mythological both primavera and birth venus have been seen wedding paintings that suggest appropriate behaviors for brides and yet another interpretation the birth venus whose title derives from vasari but whose action perhaps better represents the arrival venus provided here its charles mack this interpretation has not been adopted renaissance art historians and remains since depends the painting being commissioned the yet the work not documented medici hands before mack sees the painting allegory extolling the virtues lorenzo medici according his reading the the scene was inspired the text homeric hymn published florence the greek refugee demetrios chalkokond but something more than rediscovered homeric hymn was likely the mind the medici family member who commissioned this painting from the painter and the humanist scholars who probably advised him would have recalled that pliny the elder had mentioned lost masterpiece the celebrated apelles representing venus anadyomene venus rising from the sea according alexander the great offered his pankaspe the model for the nude venus and realizing that apelles had fallen love with the gave her the artist gesture extreme pliny went note that painting pankaspe venus was later dedicated augustus the shrine his father caesar pliny also stated that the lower part the painting was and was impossible find anyone who could restore this picture decayed from age and and nero substituted for another painting the hand dorotheus thus what the mighty romans could not their worthy the through the hand could pliny also noted second painting apelles venus superior even his earlier that had been begun artist but left once botticelli his version the birth venus might seen completing the task begun his ancient even surpassing giving added support this interpretation botticelli again apelles the fact that that very claim was voiced ugolino verino poem entitled giving praise the history such deliberately creative act botticelli may have performed with his birth venus would long way towards explaining the curious flatness and linearity the which seem very out keeping with the direction renaissance art and with own approach was the dimensionality this painting deliberate attempt replicate the style ancient painting found greek vases the walls etruscan while botticelli might well have been celebrated revivified his birth venus also testified the special nature chief lorenzo medici although now seems that the painting was executed for another member the medici likely was intended celebrate and flatter its lorenzo medici

town portovenere the port thus pankaspe the ancient living prototype the mistress alexander the great the laurentian becomes the lovely model for the lost venus executed the legendary apelles reborn through the recreative talents which ended installed emperor augustus the temple dedicated supposed founder julius caesar the case birth venus the suggested references supported other internal indicators such the stand laurel bushes the would have been just the sort thing erudite florentine humanists would have accordingly overt lorenzo becomes the new alexander the great with implied link both the first roman and even legendary caesar lorenzo furthermore not only magnificent was alexander also ultimately these readings the birth venus flatter not only the medici and botticelli but all home the worthy successors some the greatest figures both governance and the these essentially pagan readings birth venus should not exclude more purely christian which may derived from the neoplatonic reading the painting indicated viewed from religious the nudity venus suggests that eve before the fall well the pure love once the goddess love will don the earthly garb mortal act that will lead the new eve the madonna whose purity represented the nude once draped earthly garments she becomes personification the christian church which offers spiritual transport back the pure love eternal this case the scallop shell upon which this image church stands may seen its traditionally symbolic pilgrimage furthermore the broad expanse sea serves reminder the virgin title stella maris alluding both the name and the heavenly body the sea brings forth venus just the virgin gives birth the ultimate symbol christ rather than choosing one the many interpretations offered for depiction
