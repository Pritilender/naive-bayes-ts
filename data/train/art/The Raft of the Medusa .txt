common with the raft the medusa unlikely that ricault had seen the exhibition and reception the raft the medusa was first shown the paris salon under the generic title naufrage scene shipwreck although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary raft was the star the salon strikes and attracts all journal louis xviii visited the salon three days before the and reportedly said monsieur vous venez faire naufrage qui est pas pour vous freely translated monsieur your shipwreck certainly critics were the horror and the subject exercised but devotees classicism expressed
