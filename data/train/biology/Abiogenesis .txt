planets may have caused late heavy bombardment that pockmarked the moon and the other inner planets mars and presumably earth and this would likely have repeatedly sterilized the had life appeared before that geologically the hadean earth would have been far more active than any other time its studies meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such aluminium with half life years and potassium with life years isotopes mainly produced were much more coupled with internal heating result gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle there would have been great deal mantle convection with the probable result many more smaller and very active tectonic plates than modern examining the time interval between such devastating environmental the time interval when life might first have come into existence can found for different early study maher and stevenson shows that the deep marine hydrothermal setting provides suitable site for the origin abiogenesis could have

from similar formations the nearby akilia island isotopic fingerprints typical preserved the have been used suggest that life existed the planet already billion years christian duve argues that the determination chemistry means that life has emerge chemical reactions happen quickly not any reaction takes millennium complete then the chances are all the reagents will simply dissipate break down the unless they are replenished other faster conceptual history john desmond bernal has identified number outstanding difficulties accounts the origin earlier such spontaneous generation were based upon explanation that life was continuously created result chance spontaneous generation spontaneous generation belief the present ongoing spontaneous generation certain forms life from living matter goes back aristotle and ancient greek philosophy and continued have support western scholarship until the this belief was paired with belief that one form life derived from different form bees from classical notions spontaneous which can considered under the modern term held that certain living organisms are generated decaying organic according aristotle was readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls flies from putrid mice from dirty crocodiles from rotting logs the bottom bodies and the such assumptions started sir thomas browne published his pseudodoxia epidemica subtitled enquiries into very many received and commonly presumed truths which was attack false beliefs and vulgar his alexander ross erroneously refuted stating question this spontaneous question sense and doubts this let him egypt and there will find the fields swarming with begot the mud nylus the great calamity the robert hooke published the first drawings hooke was followed anton van leeuwenhoek who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought have been protozoa and bacteria many felt the existence microorganisms was evidence support spontaneous since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction through cell division had not yet been van leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from putrefaction and that frogs could likewise arise from using broad range experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study insect the became convinced that spontaneous generation was the first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came when francesco redi showed that maggots appeared meat when flies were prevented from laying was gradually shown least the case all the higher and readily visible the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was the alternative seemed biogenesis that every living thing came from existing living thing omne vivum ovo latin for every living thing from lazzaro spallanzani demonstrated that microbes were present the and could killed louis pasteur performed series experiments that demonstrated that organisms such bacteria and fungi not spontaneously appear nutrient rich but only invade them from the origin the terms biogenesis and abiogenesis the term biogenesis usually credited either henry bastian thomas henry huxley bastian used the term around unpublished exchange with john tyndall mean life origination commencement huxley new president the british association for the advancement science delivered address entitled biogenesis and abiogenesis introduced the term biogenesis with opposite meaning and also introduced the term abiogenesis subsequently the preface book the modes origin lowest organisms the author refers the possible confusion with usage and explicitly renounced his own alternatives biogenesis the belief that spontaneous ordering spontaneous generation impossible led the middle the the theory biogenesis had accumulated much evidential due the work louis pasteur and that the alternative theory spontaneous generation had been effectively pasteur and darwin charles darwin pasteur himself after definitive finding never will the doctrine spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck this simple one alternative was that origins earth had come from somewhere else the periodically resurrected see above bernal demonstrates that this approach equivalent the last resort asserting the operation spiritual turns the argument creation design creator such bernal demonstrated was unscientific and number scientists defined life result inner life which the late century was championed henri bergson the concept evolution proposed charles darwin put end these metaphysical letter joseph dalton hooker february charles darwin addressed the suggesting that the original spark life may have begun warm little with all sorts ammonia and phosphoric lights heat electricity etc present that protein compound was chemically formed ready undergo still more complex went explain that the present day such matter would instantly devoured which would not have been the case before living creatures were other the presence life itself makes the search for the spontaneous origin life dependent the artificial production organic compounds the sterile conditions the primordial hypothesis alexander oparin urey experiment new notable research theory the subject appeared until when alexander oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution his book the origin life oparin proposed that the spontaneous generation that had been attacked louis pasteur did fact occur but was now impossible because the conditions found the early earth had and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated oparin argued that primeval organic molecules could created oxygenless atmosphere through the action these would combine ever more complex ways until they formed coacervate droplets these droplets would grow fusion with other and reproduce through fission into daughter and have primitive metabolism which those factors which promote cell survive and those that not become many modern theories the origin life still take ideas starting robert shapiro has summarized the primordial theory oparin and haldane its mature the early earth had chemically reducing this exposed energy various produced simple organic compounds monomers these compounds accumulated soup which may have been concentrated various locations oceanic vents further more complex organic polymers and ultimately life developed the around the same haldane suggested that the prebiotic different from their modern would have formed hot dilute which organic compounds could have bernal pioneer ray crystallography called this idea biopoiesis biopoesis the process living matter evolving from replicating but nonliving and proposed that biopoiesis passes through number intermediate one the most important pieces experimental support for the soup theory came graduate stanley miller and his harold urey performed experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic under conditions like those posited the haldane the famous miller urey experiment used highly reduced mixture ammonia and hydrogen form basic organic monomers such amino this provided direct experimental support for the second point the soup theory and around the remaining two points the theory that much the debate now the urey mixture hydrogen methane and ammonia was cycled through apparatus that delivered electrical sparks the after one was found that about the carbon the system was now the form racemic mixture organic including amino which are the building blocks proteins bernal shows that based upon this and subsequent work there difficulty principle forming most the molecules which recognise the basic molecules life from their inorganic the underlying hypothesis held haldane bernal miller and for was that multiple conditions the primeval earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized the same set complex organic compounds from such simple reanalysis the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the miller and urey using current and more advanced analytical equipment and has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered the one the more important findings was amino far more than the five originally however bernal rightly shows that not enough explain the formation such what says chemical explanation the origins these molecules that suggests the presence suitable sources and sinks for free proteinoid microspheres proteinoid trying uncover the intermediate stages abiogenesis mentioned sidney fox the and studied the spontaneous formation peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early demonstrated that amino acids could spontaneously form small chains called one his allowed amino acids dry out puddled dry spot prebiotic found they the amino acids formed often thread submicroscopic polypeptide molecules now named proteinoid microspheres another experiment using similar method set suitable conditions for life fox collected volcanic material from cinder cone hawaii discovered that the temperature was over just inches beneath the surface the cinder and suggested that this might have been the environment which life was molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash and into the placed lumps lava over amino acids derived from ammonia and sterilized all and baked the lava over the amino acids for few hours glass sticky substance formed over the surface and when the lava was drenched sterilized water brown liquid leached turned out that the amino acids had combined form proteinoids and the proteinoids had combined form small globules that fox called microspheres his proteinoids were not although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent cyanobacteria but they contained functional nucleic acids any encoded based upon such colin pittendrigh stated december that laboratories will creating living cell within ten remark that reflected the typical contemporary levels innocence the complexity cell more recent theories bernal identified three different sorts difficulties the abiogenetic origins life stage saw the origins organic and this now fairly well the necessity source and sink and the necessity fluid medium has been much studied see stage saw the necessity explain how organic monomers became ordered into biologically active once again there the necessity sources and sinks for this the discovery alkaline vents and the similarity with the proton found the basis biological life has begun provide evidence for the second problem foreseen bernal was the origin the work with the rna world specifically intended find answers this stage saw was the most this was the discovery methods which biological reactions were incorporated behind cell modern work the self organising capacities which cell membranes and the work micropores various substrates way house towards the development independent living cells ongoing research designed answer this current models there still standard the origin most currently accepted models draw least some elements from the framework laid out alexander oparin and john haldane who postulated the molecular chemical evolution theory according the first molecules constituting the earliest cells were synthesized under natural conditions slow process molecular and these molecules then organized into the first molecular system with properties with biological oparin and haldane suggested that the atmosphere the early earth may have been chemically reducing composed primarily methane ammonia water hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and phosphate with molecular oxygen and ozone either rare however the current scientific model atmosphere that contained hydrogen oxygen mostly the form water carbon hydrogen and smaller amounts carbon free methane and inert the atmosphere proposed oparin and electrical activity can catalyze the creation certain basic small molecules monomers such amino this was demonstrated the miller urey experiment stanley miller and harold urey reported john desmond bernal coined the term biopoiesis refer the origin and suggested that occurred three stages the origin biological monomers the origin biological polymers and the evolution from molecules suggested that evolution commenced between stage and the chemical processes that took place the early earth are called chemical evolution both manfred eigen and sol spiegelman demonstrated that evolution including variation and natural selection can occur populations molecules well spiegelman took advantage natural selection synthesize spiegelman monster which had genome with just bases eigen built work and produced similar system with just nucleotides chemical evolution was followed the initiation biological evolution which led the first one has yet synthesized protocell using basic components which would have the necessary properties life the called without such explanations have tended focused chemosynthesis however some researchers are working this notably steen rasmussen and jack szostak others have argued that down more one such successfully attempted craig venter and others the institute for genomic research involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer attempting discern which point the most minimal requirements for life were chemical origin organic molecules the elements except for hydrogen ultimately derive from stellar nucleosynthesis complex including organic form naturally both space and there are two possible sources organic molecules the early terrestrial origins organic synthesis driven impact shocks other energy sources such ultraviolet redox coupling electrical miller extraterrestrial origins formation organic molecules interstellar dust clouds and rained down see pseudo panspermia estimates these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before within the early atmosphere made available quantities organics comparable those produced other energy cladogram has been estimated that the late heavy bombardment may also have effectively sterilised the surface depth tens life evolved deeper than would have also been shielded from the early high levels ultraviolet radiation from the tauri stage the simulations geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found the urey experiments see the deep hydrothermal everett shock has found there enormous thermodynamic drive form organic seawater and hydrothermal which are far from mix and move towards more stable shock has found that the available energy maximised around degrees precisely the temperatures which the hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea the base the tree life closest the last universal common ancestor chemical synthesis while features self organization and self replication are often considered the hallmark living there are many instances abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper palasek showed that assembly rna molecules can occur spontaneously due physical factors hydrothermal virus assembly within host cells has implications for the study the origin lends further credence the hypothesis that life could have started assembling organic multiple sources energy were available for chemical reactions the early for heat such from geothermal processes standard energy source for other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges lightning among unfavorable reactions can also driven highly favorable the case sulfur for this was probably important for carbon fixation the conversion carbon from its inorganic form organic note carbon fixation via sulfur chemistry highly and occurs neutral and iron sulfur which are abundant near hydrothermal vents are also capable producing small amounts amino acids and other biological formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed the presence various terrestrial formamide ubiquitous the produced the reaction water and hcn hydrogen cyanide has several advantages prebiotic including the ability easily become concentrated through the evaporation although hcn only affects aerobic organisms eukaryotes and aerobic can play roles other chemical processes such the synthesis the amino acid glycine was shown that the nucleic acid purine base adenine can formed heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also leslie orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis due the concentrating effect for key precursors such hydrogen cyanide research stanley miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for cytosine and uracil may require boiling research the miller group notes the formation seven different amino acids and types nucleobases ice when ammonia and cyanide were left freezer from other work demonstrated the formation triazines alternative nucleobases pyrimidines including cytosine and and adenine from urea solutions subjected thaw cycles under reductive atmosphere with spark discharges energy the explanation given for the unusual speed these reactions such low temperature eutectic freezing ice crystal stays only molecules water join the growing while impurities like salt cyanide are these impurities become crowded microscopic pockets liquid within the and this crowding causes the molecules collide more the time the miller urey experiment scientific consensus was that the early earth had reducing atmosphere with compounds relatively rich hydrogen and poor oxygen and opposed and however current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere either weakly reducing neutral see also oxygen catastrophe such atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety amino acids that could although studies that include iron and carbonate minerals thought present early the experimental conditions have again produced diverse array amino other scientific research has focused two other potential reducing outer space and sea thermal the spontaneous formation complex polymers from abiotically generated monomers under the conditions posited the soup theory not all straightforward besides the necessary basic organic compounds that would have prohibited the formation polymers were formed high concentration during the urey and experiments the urey for produces many substances that would react with the amino acids terminate their coupling into peptide chains autocatalysis autocatalysts are substances that catalyze the production and therefore are simple molecular the simplest replicating chemical systems are and typically contain three two precursors that join together form product and the product molecule the product molecule catalyzes the reaction providing complementary template which binds the thus bringing them such systems have been demonstrated both biological macromolecules and small organic systems that not proceed template such the reproduction micelles and vesicles have also been stuart kauffman proposed that life initially arose autocatalytic chemical british ethologist richard dawkins wrote about autocatalysis potential explanation for the origin life his book the tale his dawkins cites experiments performed julius rebek and his colleagues the scripps research institute california which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester one system from the experiment contained variants aate which catalysed the synthesis this experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within population entities with which could interpreted rudimentary form natural citation needed the early manfred eigen and peter schuster examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and replicating hypercycle prebiotic the information storing system possibly produces enzyme which catalyzes the formation another information sequence until the product the last aids the formation the first information mathematically hypercycles could create quasispecies which through natural selection entered into form darwinian boost hypercycle theory was the discovery that certain forms itself into ribozymes capable catalyzing their own chemical the hypercycle theory requires the existence complex biochemicals such nucleotides which are not formed under the conditions proposed the urey geoffrey hoffmann student contributed the concept life involving both replication and metabolism emerging from catalytic his contributions included showing that early sloppy translation machinery can stable against error catastrophe the

meteorites suggest that the chirality life derives from abiogenic since amino acids from meteorites show handed whereas sugars show predominantly handed the same found living reproduction duplication and the rna world rna world hypothesis thermus thermophilus the rna world hypothesis describes early earth with replicating and catalytic rna but dna generally accepted that current life earth descends from rna although based life may not have been the first life this conclusion drawn from many independent lines such the observations that rna central the translation process and that small rnas can catalyze all the chemical groups and information transfers required for the structure the ribosome has been called the smoking showed that the ribosome ribozyme with central core rna and amino acid side chains within angstroms the active site where peptide bond formation the concept the rna world was first proposed the francis crick leslie orgel and carl woese and the term was coined walter gilbert possible precursors for the evolution protein synthesis include mechanism synthesize short peptide cofactors from mechanism for the duplication likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely although some roles have since been taken over major remaining questions this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution the ribosome and determining how the genetic code arose eugene koonin said despite considerable experimental and theoretical compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin replication and the key processes that together comprise the core biological systems and the apparent requisite biological the rna world concept might offer the best chance for the resolution this conundrum but far cannot adequately account for the emergence

macroscopic histories each repeated infinite number emergence even highly complex systems chance not just possible but rna synthesis and replication the rna world has spurred scientists try determine rna molecules could have spontaneously formed that were capable catalyzing their own evidences suggest chemical conditions including the presence boron molybdenum and oxygen for initially producing

put there were difficulties the abiotic synthesis the nucleotides cytosine and uracil subsequent research has shown possible routes for formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological

that complex organic molecules arose gradually non organic replication platform silicate crystals cairns smith trenchant critic other models chemical however admits that like many models the origin his own also has its kahr and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act source transferable using crystals potassium hydrogen phthalate mother crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used seeds grow daughter crystals from they then examined the distribution imperfections the new crystals and found that the imperfections the mother crystals were reproduced the but the daughter crystals also had many additional for like behavior the quantity inheritance these imperfections should have exceeded that the mutations the successive but did thus kahr concluded that the were not faithful enough store and transfer information from one generation the gold hot model the thomas gold proposed the theory that life first developed not the surface the but several kilometers below the the discovery the late nanobes filamental structures that are smaller than but that may contain deep rocks might seen lending support now reasonably well established that microbial life plentiful shallow depths the kilometres below the the form extremophile archaea rather than the known eubacteria which live more accessible claimed that discovery microbial life below the surface another body our solar system would lend significant credence this thomas gold also asserted that trickle food from unreachable source needed for survival because life arising puddle organic material likely consume all its food and become gold theory that the flow such food due gassing primordial methane from the earth mantle more conventional explanations the food supply deep microbes away from sedimentary carbon that the organisms subsist hydrogen released interaction between water and iron compounds primitive extraterrestrial life panspermia exogenesis related but not the same the notion panspermia neither hypothesis actually answers the question how life first but merely shifts another planet however the advantage extraterrestrial origin primitive life that life not required have evolved each planet occurs but rather single and then spread about the galaxy other star systems via cometary meteorite evidence support the hypothesis but finds support studies martian meteorites found antarctica and studies extremophile microbes survival outer regression alternative earthly abiogenesis the hypothesis that primitive life may have originally formed extraterrestrially extraterrestrial life either space studies which apply the equivalent moore law biological evolution and extrapolate backwards have proposed that life began billion years billions years before the earth was they noted that life may have started from systems with single heritable elements that are functionally equivalent nucleotide the case evolution empirical evidence suggested doubling complexity every million the age trees can measured the number the hypothesis that the age life could measured biological complexity the length functional redundant dna the genome was transformed complexity plotted against the time origin large evolutionary then the points fit straight line see the exponential increase complexity can explained positive activating feedback loop the regression line hits zero one nucleotide billion years this model and since our solar system billion years then life somehow arrived earth from older stellar this hypothesis was criticized eugene koonin who suggested that the rates early biological evolution might have been much faster due the absence competition early chris adami argued that inconceivable that life began with just few answer

after reactions are initiated mostly ionizing radiation based computer model studies the complex organic molecules necessary for life may have formed dust grains the protoplanetary disk surrounding the sun before the formation the according the computer this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets observations suggest that the majority organic compounds introduced earth interstellar dust particles are considered principal agents the formation complex thanks their peculiar surface catalytic activities studies reported based isotopic ratios organic compounds found the murchison meteorite suggested that the rna component uracil and related including xanthine were formed august report based nasa studies meteorites found earth was published suggesting dna components adenine guanine and related organic were made outer space scientists also found that the cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organics amorphous organic solids with mixed aromatic aliphatic structure that could created and stars scientist who suggested that these compounds may have been related the development life earth said that this the life earth may have had easier time getting started these organics can serve basic ingredients for star dust glycolaldehyde the first example interstellar sugar molecule was detected the forming region near the center our was discovered jes rgensen and jan hollis then august the same team reported the detection glycolaldehyde distant star the molecule was found around the protostellar binary iras light years from glycolaldehyde needed form ribonucleic acid rna which similar function dna these findings suggest that complex organic molecules may form stellar systems prior the formation eventually arriving young planets early their because sugars are associated with both metabolism and the genetic code two the most basic aspects thought the discovery extraterrestrial sugar increases the likelihood that life may exist elsewhere our nasa announced that scientists had identified another fundamental chemical building block life comet for the first glycine amino which was detected material ejected from comet and grabbed stardust probe glycine has been detected meteorites carl who leads astrobiology institute commented that the discovery glycine comet supports the idea that the fundamental building blocks life are prevalent and strengthens the argument that life the universe may common rather than comets are encrusted with outer layers dark thought tar like substance composed complex organic material

simulating the atmosphere lipid world gard model the lipid world theory postulates that the first replicating object was known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers water while under agitation the same structure cell these molecules were not present early but other amphiphilic long chain molecules also form furthermore these bodies may expand insertion additional and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition lipids the two progenies the main idea this theory that the molecular composition the lipid bodies the preliminary way for information and evolution led the appearance polymer entities such rna dna that may store information studies vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have far been limited systems

and exoplanets radioactive beach hypothesis zachary adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during time when the moon was much closer may have concentrated grains uranium and other radioactive elements the water mark primordial where they may have been responsible for generating building according computer models reported astrobiology deposit such radioactive materials could show the same self sustaining nuclear reaction that found the oklo uranium ore seam gabon such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy generate organic such amino acids and sugars from acetonitrile radioactive monazite material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between making biologically accessible thus amino sugars and soluble phosphates might have been produced according radioactive actinides left behind some concentration the might have formed part metallic these complexes could have been important early catalysts living john parnell has suggested that such process could provide part the crucible the early stages any early wet rocky long the planet large enough have generated system plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals the the early earth thought have had many smaller might have provided suitable environment for such ultraviolet and assisted replication model from thermodynamic perspective the origin life springs the ultraviolet and assisted replication model karo michaelian points out that any model for the origin life must take into account the fact that life irreversible thermodynamic process which arises and persists because produces entropy entropy production not incidental the process but rather the fundamental reason for its present day life augments the entropy production earth catalysing the water cycle through evapotranspiration michaelian argues that the thermodynamic function life today produce entropy through coupling with the water then this probably was its function its very turns out that both rna and dna when water solution are very strong absorbers and extremely rapid dissipaters ultraviolet light within the wavelength which that part the spectrum that could have penetrated the dense prebiotic have shown that the amount ultraviolet light reaching the surface the archean eon could have been orders magnitude greater than today where rna and dna absorb most absorption and dissipation light the organic molecules the archean ocean surface would have significantly increased the temperature the surface and led enhanced evaporation and thus have augmented the primitive water since absorption and dissipation high energy photons entropy producing argues that equilbrium abiogenic synthesis rna and dna utilizing light would have been thermodynamically simple mechanism that could explain the replication rna and dna without resort the use enzymes could also provided within the same thermodynamic framework assuming that life arose when the temperature the primitive seas had cooled somewhat below the denaturing temperature rna dna based the ratio found cherts the barberton greenstone belt south africa about surface temperatures are predicted have been around close rna dna denaturing uncoiling and temperatures during the the surface water temperature would drop below the denaturing temperature and single strand dna could act template for the formation double strand during the daylight rna and dna would absorb light and convert this directly heat the ocean thereby raising the local temperature enough allow for denaturing rna and the copying process would have been repeated with each diurnal such temperature assisted mechanism replication bears similarity polymerase chain reaction routine laboratory procedure employed multiply dna michaelian suggests that the traditional origin life that expects describe the emergence life from equilibrium erroneous and that equilibrium conditions must the importance entropy production the emergence since denaturation would most probable the late afternoon when the archean sea surface temperature would and since late afternoon submarine sunlight somewhat circularly polarized the homochirality the organic molecules life can also explained within the proposed thermodynamic multiple genesis different forms life with variable origin processes may have appeared simultaneously the early history earth the other forms may leaving distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry using arsenic instead phosphorus survive extremophiles simply unnoticed through their being analogous organisms the current life hartman for example combines number theories proposing the first organisms were replicating rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids this system replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region the hotspring acquiring the ability fix finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis nucleotides and biosynthesis recapitulates then the synthesis amino acids preceded the synthesis the purine and pyrimidine furthermore the polymerization the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization amino acid esters lynn margulis endosymbiotic theory suggests that multiple forms archea entered into symbiotic relationship form the eukaryotic the horizontal
