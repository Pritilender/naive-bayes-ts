place the life cycle which often quite however practical adaptation often used for the product those features species which result from the many aspects animal plant can correctly called though there are always some features whose function using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the bodily part function the the two senses the word may distinguished adaptation one the two main processes that explain the diverse species see such the different species darwin finches the other speciation splitting cladogenesis caused geographical isolation some other favorite example used today study the interplay adaptation and speciation the evolution cichlid fish african where the question reproductive isolation much more adaptation not always simple where the ideal phenotype evolves for given external organism must viable all stages its development and all stages its this places constraints the evolution behaviour and structure the main over which there has been much the requirement that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should relatively because developmental systems are complex and however not clear what relatively should for example polyploidy plants reasonably common large genetic the origin eukaryotic symbiosis more dramatic all adaptations help organisms survive their ecological niches these adaptive traits may behavioral

affects all aspects the life definitions the following definitions are mainly due theodosius dobzhansky adaptation habitat adaptedness adaptive trait adaptedness and fitness fitness from the above clear that there relationship between adaptedness and fitness key population genetics concept differences fitness between genotypes predict the rate evolution natural natural selection changes the relative frequencies alternative insofar they are heritable although the two are the one does not imply the phenotype with high adaptedness may not have high dobzhansky mentioned the example the californian redwood which highly but relict species danger elliott sober commented that adaptation was retrospective concept since implied something about the history whereas fitness predicts darwinian fitness selective coefficient malthusian parameter reciprocal transplant brief history history evolutionary thought adaptation fact life that has been accepted many the great thinkers who have tackled the world living their explanations how adaptation arises that separates these few the most significant empedocles did not believe that adaptation required final cause purpose but came about since such things aristotle however did believe final natural theology adaptation was interpreted the work even evidence for the existence william paley believed that organisms were perfectly adapted the lives they argument that shadowed leibniz who had argued that god had brought about the best all possible worlds voltaire pangloss parody this optimistic and hume also argued against the bridgewater treatises are product natural though some the authors managed present their work fairly neutral the series was lampooned robert knox who held evolutionary the bilgewater treatises darwin broke with the tradition emphasising the flaws and limitations which occurred the animal and plant lamarck evolutionary theory the inheritance acquired traits whose main purpose explain adaptations natural proposed tendency for organisms become more moving ladder plus the influence usually expressed use and disuse his evolutionary and those geoffroy fail because they cannot reconciled with this was known even before mendel medical men interested human races wells lawrence and especially weismann many other students natural such buffon accepted and some also accepted without voicing their opinions the this illustrates the real merit darwin and wallace and secondary figures such bates for putting forward mechanism whose significance had only been glimpsed century experimental field studies and breeding experiments people such ford and dobzhansky produced evidence that natural selection was not only the behind but was much stronger force than had previously been types adaptations adaptation the heart and soul niles eldredge changes habitat before darwin adaptation was seen fixed relationship between organism and its was not appreciated that the climate changed did the and the habitat did the also habitats are subject changes their biota for invasions species from other the relative numbers species given habitat are always change the though much depends the speed and degree the when the habitat three main things may happen resident habitat genetic change extinction all three things may occur these three only genetic change brings about adaptation habitat tracking when habitat the most common thing happen that the resident population moves another locale which suits this the typical response flying insects oceanic who have wide though not opportunity for this common response called habitat tracking one explanation put forward for the periods apparent stasis the fossil record the punctuated equilibrium thesis genetic change genetic change what occurs population when natural selection acts the genetic variability the moreover some mutations may create genetic variation that will lead differing characteristics offspring and hence abet the first pathways based metabolism may have been parts purine nucleotide with previous metabolic pathways being part the ancient rna world this the population adapts genetically its genetic changes may result visible may adjust physiological activity way that suits the now clear that habitats and biota frequently therefore follows that the process adaptation never finally over may happen that the environment changes and the species comes fit its surroundings better and the other may happen that changes the environment occur relatively and then the species becomes less and less well seen like adaptation genetic tracking process which goes all the time some but especially when the population cannot does not move less hostile also greater lesser the process affects every species particular ecosystem van valen thought that even stable competing species had constantly adapt maintain their relative this became known the red hypothesis intimate adaptations adaptation evolution where the existence one species tightly over bound with the life another new adaptations which occur one species are often followed the appearance and spread corresponding features the other there are many examples the idea emphasises that the life and death living things intimately not just with the physical but with the life other these relationships are intrinsically and may continue trajectory for millions has the

angiosperms during the early cretaceous period led parallel radiations angiosperms and insects into the late the evolution nectaries late cretaceous flowers signals the beginning the mutualism between hymenopterans and mimicry mimicry hoverflies henry walter bates work amazonian butterflies led him develop the first scientific account mimicry especially the kind mimicry which bears his batesian mimicry this the mimicry palatable species unpalatable noxious common example seen temperate gardens the hover fly many which though bearing sting mimic the warning colouration hymenoptera wasps and bees such mimicry does not need perfect improve the survival the palatable bates wallace and ller believed that batesian and llerian mimicry provided evidence for the action natural selection view which now standard amongst all aspects this situation can and have the subject field and experimental work these ideas continues this the topic connects strongly speciation genetics and development the basic internal adaptations there are some important adaptations with the overall coordination the systems the such adaptations may have significant examples vertebrates would temperature regulation improvements brain function effective immune system example plants would the development the reproductive system flowering plants such adaptations may make the clade monophyletic group more viable wide range the acquisition such major adaptations has often served the spark for adaptive radiation and huge success over long periods time for whole group animals compromise and conflict between adaptations profound truth that nature does not know that genetical story makeshift compromise and peter medawar all adaptations have horse legs are great for running but they scratch their mammals hair helps but offers niche for ectoparasites the only flying penguins under adaptations serving different functions may mutually compromise and makeshift occur not selection pressures pull different and the adaptation that results some kind since the phenotype whole the target impossible improve simultaneously all aspects the phenotype the same ernst mayr consider the antlers the irish

size during the last glacial period presumably depended the relative gain and loss reproductive capacity the population elks during that another camouflage avoid detection destroyed when vivid colors are displayed mating here the risk life counterbalanced the necessity for stream dwelling such caucasian salamander gold striped salamander have very long perfectly adapted life the banks fast small rivers and mountain brooks elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out however elongated body increases risk desiccation and decreases dispersal ability the also negatively affects

famous must reduce his maneuverability and and hugely also its growth costs food darwin explanation its advantage was terms sexual selection depends the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals the same sex and exclusive relation the kind sexual selection represented the peacock called mate with implication that the process selects the more fit over the less and has survival the recognition sexual selection was for long time but has been the blue peafowl pavo cristatus pretty successful with big natural range the overall outcome their mating system quite the conflict between the size the human foetal brain which cannot larger than about else will not get through the pelvis and the size needed for adult brain about means the brain newborn child quite the most vital things human life speech just have wait while the brain grows and that the result the birth much the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance without which our pelvis could shaped more suitably for neanderthals had similar shifts function adaptation and function are two aspects one julian huxley pre adaptations this occurs when species population has characteristics which are suited for conditions which have not yet for the polyploid rice grass spartina townsendii better adapted than either its parent species their own habitat saline marsh and white leghorn fowl are markedly more resistant vitamin deficiency than other plentiful diet there but restricted diet this preadaptation could pre adaptation may occur because natural population carries huge quantity genetic variability diploid eukaryotes this consequence the system sexual reproduction where mutant alleles get partially for the selective advantage heterozygotes micro with their huge also carry great deal genetic the first experimental evidence the adaptive nature genetic variants organisms was provided salvador luria and max who developed fluctuation analysis method show the random fluctuation existing genetic changes that conferred resistance phage the bacterium escherichia coli option existing exaptation exaptation the classic example the ear ossicles mammals which know from palaeontological and embryological studies originated the upper and lower jaws and the hyoid their synapsid ancestors and further back still were part the gill arches early owe this esoteric knowledge the comparative who century were the cutting edge evolutionary the word exaptation was coined cover these shifts which are surprisingly common evolutionary the origin wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation more recent discovery see feathered dinosaurs related issues non adaptive traits some traits not appear that they appear have neutral even deleterious effect fitness the current because genes have pleiotropic effects not all traits may functional spandrels alternatively trait may have been adaptive some point evolutionary but change habitats caused what used adaptation become unnecessary even hindrance maladaptations such adaptations are termed vestigial vestigial organs vestigiality many organisms have vestigial which are the remnants fully functional structures their result changes lifestyle the organs became and are either not functional reduced with the loss function goes the loss positive and the subsequent accumulation deleterious mutations since any structure represents some kind cost the general economy the advantage may accrue from their elimination once they are not examples wisdom teeth the loss pigment and functional eyes cave the loss structure endoparasites fitness landscapes fitness landscape sewall wright proposed that populations occupy adaptive peaks fitness landscape order evolve higher population would first have pass through valley maladaptive intermediate given population might trapped peak that not optimally extinction extinction population cannot move change sufficiently preserve its term then will become least that the species may may not survive other species extinction occurs when the death rate over the entire species gene pool exceeds the birth rate for long enough period for the species was observation van valen that groups species tend have characteristic and fairly regular rate extinction extinction just have there also extinction refers the loss species due the extinction for the extinction parasitic insects following the loss their extinction can also occur when flowering plant loses its pollinator through the disruption food chain species extinction manifestation the interconnectedness organisms complex ecosystems while extinction may not the most important cause species certainly insidious flexibility acclimatization learning flexibility deals with the relative capacity organism maintain themselves different their degree specialization acclimatization term used for automatic physiological adjustments during learning the term used for improvement behavioral performance during biology these terms are not for changes during life which improve the performance these adjustments are not inherited genetically the next adaptation the other occurs over many gradual process caused natural selection which changes the genetic population the collective performs better its flexibility populations differ their phenotypic plasticity which the ability organism with given genotype change its phenotype response changes its move different greater lesser all living things can adjust the degree flexibility and varies some extent between highly specialized animal plant lives only defined eats specific type and cannot survive its needs are not many herbivores are like extreme examples are koalas which depend eucalyptus and pandas which require bamboo the other eats range and can survive many different examples are rats crabs and many the tendency behave specialized exploratory manner inherited rather different developmental animal plant developmentally flexible when raised transferred new conditions develops that better fitted survive the new once there are huge differences between and the capacities flexible are acclimatization acclimatization humans move higher respiration and physical exertion become but after spending time high altitude conditions they acclimatize the pressure increasing production red blood corpuscles the ability acclimatize but not the acclimatization fecundity goes but deaths from some tropical diseases also goes over longer period some people will reproduce better these high altitudes than they will contribute more heavily later gradually the whole population becomes adapted the new this know takes because the performance term communities higher altitude significantly better than the performance new even when the new arrivals have had time make physiological some kinds acclimatization happen rapidly that they are better called the rapid colour changes some flatfish cephalopods chameleons are learning social learning supreme for and possible for quite few mammals and that does not involve genetic transmission except the extent that the capacities are similarly the capacity learn inherited but not what the capacity for human speech but not the details function and teleonomy adaptation raises some issues concerning how biologists use key terms such function function say something has function say something about what does for the obviously also says something about its how has come heart pumps that its also emits which just ancillary that not its the heart has history which may well poorly and that history about how natural selection formed and maintained the heart every aspect organism that has function has now adaptation must have functional therefore expect must have undergone selection caused relative survival its would quite wrong use the word adaptation about trait which arose widely regarded unprofessional for biologist say something like wing for although that their normal biologist would conscious that sometime the remote past feathers small dinosaur had the function retaining and that later many wings were not used for flying penguins ostriches the biologist would rather say that the wings bird insect usually had the function aiding that would carry the connotation being adaptation with history evolution natural teleonomy teleonomy teleonomy term invented describe the study directed functions which are not guided the conscious forethought man any supernatural contrasted with aristotle teleology which has connotations purpose and evolution adaptation hoards hindsight rather than foresight the following definition for its use the term may have been suggested colin pittendrigh grew out cybernetics and self organising systems ernst mayr george williams and jacques monod picked the term and used evolutionary philosophers science have also commented the ernest nagel analysed the concept directedness and david hull commented the use teleology and teleonomy
