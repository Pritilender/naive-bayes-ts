amphiprioninae the family pomacentridae thirty species are one the genus premnas while the remaining are the genus amphiprion the they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones depending clownfish are overall orange reddish blackish and many show white bars the largest can reach length centimetres while the smallest barely can reach centimetres contents ecology and habitat diet symbiosis and mutualism reproduction parental investment marine ornamentals taxonomy popular culture gallery references external links ecology and habitat clownfish are native warmer waters the indian and pacific oceans including the great barrier reef and the red sea while most species have restricted others are clownfish live the bottom shallow seas sheltered reefs shallow lagoons there are clownfish the atlantic diet clownfish are omnivorous and can feed undigested food from their host and the fecal matter from the clownfish provides nutrients the sea clownfish primarily feed small zooplankton from the water such copepods and tunicate with small portion their diet coming from with the exception amphiprion perideraion which primarily feeds they may also consume the tentacles their host anemone symbiosis and mutualism clownfish and sea anemones have symbiotic mutualistic relationship each providing number benefits the the individual species are generally highly host specific and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla and the species entacmaea quadricolor are frequent clownfish the sea anemone protects the clownfish from well providing food through the scraps left from the meals and occasional dead anemone the clownfish defends the anemone from its and the anemone also picks nutrients from the and functions safe nest the nitrogen excreted from clownfish increases the amount algae incorporated into the tissue their which aids the anemone tissue growth and has been theorized that the clownfish use their bright coloring lure small fish the and that the activity the clownfish results greater water circulation around the sea studies anemonefish have found that clownfish alter the flow water around sea anemone tentacles certain behaviours and movements such wedging and aeration the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits the metabolism both mainly increasing anemone body size and both clownfish and anemone clownfish cardinalfish and certain damselfish are among the few species fish that can avoid the potent poison sea there are several theories about how they can survive the sea anemone the mucus coating the fish may based sugars rather than proteins this would mean that anemones fail recognize the fish potential food source and not fire their nematocysts sting organelles the coevolution certain species clownfish with specific anemone host species and may have acquired immunity the nematocysts and toxins their host experimentation has shown that amphiprion percula may develop resistance the toxin from heteractis magnifica but not totally since was shown experimentally die when its devoid was exposed the nematocysts its reproduction group there strict dominance hierarchy the largest and most aggressive female found the only two male and group reproduce through external fertilization clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites meaning that they develop into males and when they they become the female clownfish removed from the such one the largest and most dominant males will become the remaining males will move rank the clownfish lay eggs any flat surface close their host the clownfish spawn around the time the full depending the clownfish can lay hundreds thousands the male parent guards the eggs until they hatch about six ten days typically two hours after citation needed parental investment most clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites meaning they alternate between the male and female sexes some point their anemonefish colonies usually consist the reproductive male and female and few who help tend the although multiple males habit environment with single polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibit reproductive however the largest female the social hierarchy shifts with the breeding male exhibiting protandrous sex reversal become the breeding the largest juvenile will then become the new breeding male after period rapid the existence protandry clownfish may rest the case that breeders modulate their phenotype way that causes breeders tolerate this strategy prevents conflict reducing competition between the males for one for purposefully modifying their growth rate remain small and the juveniles colony present threat the fitness the adult thereby protecting themselves from being evicted the dominant the reproductive cycle clownfish often correlated with the lunar rates spawning for clownfish peak approximately the first and third quarters the the timing this spawn means that the eggs will hatch around the full moon new moon one explanation for this lunar clock that spring tides produce the highest tides during full new nocturnal hatching during high tide may reduce predation allowing for greater capacity for namely the stronger currents and greater water volume during high tide protects the hatchlings effectively sweeping them before clownfish exhibit increased rates anemone and substrate which help prepare and clean the nest for the terms parental male clownfish are often the caretakers before making the the parents often clear oval sized clutch varying diameter for the fecundity reproductive the females usually ranges from eggs depending the size the contrast most animal the female only occasionally takes responsibility for the with males expending most the time and male clownfish care for their eggs fanning and guarding them for days until they studies have shown eggs develop more rapidly clutch when males fanned properly and that fanning represents crucial mechanism successfully developing this suggests that males have the ability control the success hatching egg clutch investing different amounts time and energy towards the for male could choose fan less times scarcity fan more times furthermore males display increased alertness when guarding more valuable eggs which paternity was females the other display generally less preference for parental behavior than all these suggest that males have increased parental investment towards the eggs compared marine ornamentals clownfish make the global marine ornamental and the global trade comes from fish bred while the majority are captured from the accounting for decreased densities exploited public aquaria and captive breeding programs are essential sustain their trade marine and has recently become economically one handful marine ornamentals whose complete life cycle has been closed members some clownfish such the maroon become aggressive others like the false percula can kept successfully with other individuals the same citation needed when sea anemone not available
