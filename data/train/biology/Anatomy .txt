some its anatomy related embryology and comparative anatomy which itself closely related evolutionary biology and phylogeny human anatomy one the basic essential sciences medicine the discipline anatomy divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy macroscopic gross anatomy the examination body parts using unaided eyesight gross anatomy also includes the branch superficial anatomy microscopic anatomy involves the use optical instruments the study the tissues various known histology and also the study cells the history anatomy characterized progressive understanding the functions the organs and structures the human body methods have also improved advancing from the examination animals dissection carcases and cadavers century medical imaging techniques including ray

bird anatomy mammal anatomy human anatomy invertebrate anatomy arthropod anatomy other branches anatomy history ancient medieval early modern late modern see also notes bibliography external links definition epitome derived from the greek anatemn cut cut from ana and temn anatomy the scientific study the structure organisms including their organs and tissues includes the appearance and position the various the materials from which they are their locations and their relationships with other anatomy quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions those parts and the chemical processes for anatomist concerned with the size position structure blood supply and innervation organ such the while physiologist interested the production bile and the role the liver nutrition and the regulation bodily the discipline anatomy can subdivided into number branches including gross macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy gross anatomy the study structures that are large enough seen with the naked and also includes superficial anatomy surface the study sight the external body microscopic anatomy the study structures microscopic including histology the study and embryology the study organism its immature anatomy can studied using both invasive and invasive methods with the goal obtaining information about the structure and organization organs and methods used include dissection which body opened and its organs and endoscopy which video camera equipped instrument inserted through small incision the body wall and used explore the internal organs and other angiography using rays magnetic resonance angiography are methods visualize blood the term anatomy commonly taken refer human anatomy however substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy other the term zootomy also sometimes used specifically refer the structure and tissues plants are dissimilar nature and they are studied plant anatomy animal tissues the kingdom animalia also called metazoa contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile although some have secondarily adopted sessile lifestyle most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known eumetazoans they have internal digestive chamber with one two the gametes are produced multicellular sex and the zygotes include blastula stage their embryonic development metazoans not include the sponges which have undifferentiated unlike plant cells animal cells have neither cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when are more number and much smaller than those the plant the body tissues are composed numerous types including those found muscles nerves and skin each typically has cell membrane formed phospholipids cytoplasm and nucleus all the different cells animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic all triploblastic tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers the the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm animal tissues can grouped into four basic connective epithelial muscle and nervous tissue connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous and made cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape organs and holds them the main types are loose connective adipose tissue fibrous connective cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant which collagen collagen plays major part organizing and maintaining the matrix can modified form skeleton support protect the exoskeleton rigid cuticle which stiffened mineralisation crustaceans the linking its proteins insects endoskeleton internal and present all developed animals and also many those less epithelium stain epithelial tissue composed closely packed bound each other cell adhesion molecules with little intercellular epithelial cells can squamous cuboidal columnar and rest basal lamina the upper layer the basement membrane the lower layer the reticular lamina lying next the connective tissue the extracellular matrix secreted the epithelial there are many different types modified suit particular the respiratory tract there type ciliated epithelial the small intestine there are microvilli the epithelial lining and the large intestine there are intestinal villi skin consists outer layer keratinised stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior the vertebrate keratinocytes make the cells the skin the epithelial cells the external surface the body typically secrete extracellular matrix the form cuticle simple animals this may just coat glycoproteins more advanced many glands are formed epithelial muscle tissue skeletal muscle nerve stain muscle cells form the active contractile tissue the muscle tissue functions produce force and cause either locomotion movement within internal muscle formed contractile filaments and separated into three smooth muscle skeletal muscle and obliquely striated smooth muscle has striations when examined contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over wide range stretch found such organs sea anemone tentacles and the body wall sea skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has limited range found the movement appendages and obliquely striated muscle intermediate between the other the filaments are staggered and this the type muscle found earthworms that can extend slowly make rapid higher animals striated muscles occur bundles attached bone provide movement and are often arranged antagonistic smooth muscle found the walls the uterus bladder intestines stomach esophagus respiratory airways and blood vessels cardiac muscle found only the heart allowing contract and pump blood round the nervous tissue nervous tissue composed many nerve cells known neurons which transmit some moving radially symmetrical marine animals such ctenophores and cnidarians including sea anemones and jellyfish the nerves form nerve net but most animals they are organized longitudinally into simple receptor neurons the body wall cause local reaction more complex specialised receptor cells such chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found groups and send messages along neural networks other parts the neurons can connected together ganglia higher specialized receptors are the basis sense organs and there central nervous system brain and spinal and peripheral nervous system the latter consists sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target the peripheral nervous system divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain and internal organs such the vertebrate anatomy comparative anatomy mouse all vertebrates have similar basic body plan and some point their mostly the embryonic stage share the major chordate characteristics stiffening the notochord dorsal hollow tube nervous the neural tube pharyngeal slits and tail posterior the the spinal cord protected the vertebral column and above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract below nervous tissue derived from the ectoderm connective tissues are derived from mesoderm and gut derived from the endoderm the posterior end tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the the mouth found the anterior end the and the anus the base the the defining characteristic vertebrate the vertebral column formed the development the segmented series vertebrae most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus the intervertebral discs however few such the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into jawed vertebrates are typified paired fins which may secondarily the limbs vertebrates are considered homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common this one the arguments put forward charles darwin support his theory evolution fish anatomy fish anatomy butterfly fish vertebral column the body fish divided into trunk and although the divisions between the three are not always externally the which forms the support structure inside the either made cartilaginous fish bone bony fish the main skeletal element the vertebral composed articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet the ribs attach the spine and there are limbs limb the main external features the the fins are composed either bony soft spines called which with the exception the caudal fins have direct connection with the they are supported the muscles which compose the main part the the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces the gills and round the body single circulatory the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local there inner ear but external middle ear low frequency vibrations are detected the lateral line system sense organs that run along the length the sides and these respond nearby movements and changes water sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar those ancient including skeletons composed their bodies tend ventrally they usually have five pairs gill slits and large mouth set the underside the the dermis covered with separate dermal placoid scales they have cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages but not swim bladder cartilaginous fish produce small number yolky eggs some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally egg the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical often with major evolutionary changes from the features ancient they have bony are generally laterally have five pairs gills protected operculum and mouth near the tip the the dermis covered with overlapping scales bony fish have swim bladder which helps them maintain constant depth the water but not they mostly spawn large number small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water amphibian anatomy amphibian anatomy surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta amphibians are class animals comprising frogs salamanders and caecilians they are tetrapods but the caecilians and few species salamander have either limbs their limbs are much reduced their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes their ribs are usually short and may fused the their skulls are mostly broad and and are often incompletely their skin contains little keratin and lacks but contains many mucous glands and some poison the hearts amphibians have three two atria and one ventricle they have urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily urea amphibians breathe means buccal pumping pump action which air first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the these are then closed and the air forced into the lungs contraction the they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs kept frogs the pelvic girdle robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the the feet have four five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming have suction pads for frogs have large eyes and salamanders resemble lizards their short legs project the belly close contact with the ground and they have long caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are they burrow means zones muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim undulating their body from side reptile anatomy reptile anatomy richard lydekker reptiles are class animals comprising turtles tuataras lizards snakes and crocodiles they are tetrapods but the snakes and few species lizard either have limbs their limbs are much reduced their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those the teeth are conical and mostly uniform the surface cells the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create waterproof reptiles are unable use their skin for respiration amphibians and have more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs expanding their chest the heart resembles that the amphibian but there septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated the reproductive system designed for internal with copulatory organ present most the eggs are surrounded amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid develop internally some the bladder small nitrogenous waste excreted uric acid turtles are notable for their protective they have inflexible trunk encased horny carapace above and plastron below these are formed from bony plates embedded the dermis which are overlain horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and the neck long and flexible and the head and the legs can drawn back inside the turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced horny aquatic the front legs are modified into tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged the triassic period there one living sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings either side and the jaw rigidly attached the there one row teeth the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows the upper jaw when the animal the teeth are merely projections bony material from the jaw and eventually wear the brain and heart are more primitive than the case other reptiles and the lungs have single chamber and lack bronchi the tuatara has developed parietal eye its lizards have skulls with only one fenestra each the lower bar bone below the second fenestra having been this results the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth open lizards are mostly with the trunk held off the ground sideways facing but few species have limbs and resemble lizards have moveable eardrums are present and some species have central parietal snakes are closely related having branched off from common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period and they share many the same the skeleton consists hyoid spine and ribs though few species retain vestige the pelvis and rear limbs the form pelvic spurs the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake swallow its prey snakes lack moveable the eyes being covered transparent spectacle scales they not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones their their forked tongues are used organs taste and smell and some species have sensory pits their heads enabling them locate blooded crocodilians are low slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers the head and trunk are ventrally flattened and the tail laterally undulates from side side force the animal through the water when the tough keratinised scales provide body armour and some are fused the the eyes and ears are elevated above the top the flat head enabling them remain above the surface the water when the animal valves seal the nostrils and ears when unlike other crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation oxygenated and deoxygenated bird anatomy bird anatomy duerer birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for birds are endothermic have high metabolic rate light skeletal system and powerful muscles the long bones are hollow and very air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre some the sternum wide and usually has keel and the caudal vertebrae are there are teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into covered the eyes are relatively particularly nocturnal species such they face forwards predators and sideways the feathers are outgrowths the epidermis and are found localized bands from where they fan out over the large flight feathers are found the wings and contour feathers cover the surface and fine down occurs young birds and under the contour feathers water the only cutaneous gland the single uropygial gland near the base the this produces oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens there are scales the legs and feet and claws the tips the mammal anatomy mammal anatomy great dane chihuahua mammals are diverse class mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping gliding they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have limbs limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs bats are modified into the legs most mammals are situated below the which held well clear the the bones mammals are well ossified and their which are usually are coated layer prismatic enamel the teeth are shed once milk teeth during the lifetime not the case cetaceans mammals have three bones the middle ear and cochlea the inner ear they are clothed hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat some these glands are specialised mammary glands producing milk feed the mammals breathe with lungs and have muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely nitrogenous waste excreted primarily mammals are amniotes and most are viviparous giving birth live the exception this are the laying monotremes the platypus and the echidnas most other mammals have placenta through which the developing foetus obtains but marsupials the foetal stage very short and the immature young born and finds its way its pouch where latches nipple and completes its human anatomy human anatomy mri humans have the overall body plan humans have head neck trunk which includes the thorax and abdomen two arms and hands and two legs and feet generally students certain biological sciences paramedics prosthetists and physiotherapists occupational therapists nurses and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and and medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience dissection and inspection cadavers the study microscopic anatomy histology can aided practical experience examining histological preparations under microscope human physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical which are generally taught medical students their first year medical human anatomy can taught regionally that respectively studying anatomy bodily regions such the head and studying specific such the nervous respiratory the major anatomy gray anatomy has been reorganized from systems format regional line with modern teaching thorough working knowledge anatomy required especially surgeons and doctors working some diagnostic such histopathology and radiology academic human anatomists are usually employed medical schools teaching they are often involved teaching and research into certain organs tissues invertebrate anatomy daphnia planktonic invertebrates constitute vast array living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such paramecium such complex multicellular animals the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about the animal none these creatures has the cells cell protozoans have the same basic structure those multicellular animals but some parts are specialised into the equivalent tissues and locomotion often provided cilia flagella may proceed via the advance pseudopodia food may gathered phagocytosis energy needs may supplied photosynthesis and the cell may supported endoskeleton exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular metazoans are multicellular different groups cells which have separate the most basic types metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective both which are present nearly all the outer surface the epidermis normally formed epithelial cells and secretes extracellular matrix which provides support the endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm present echinoderms sponges and some cephalopods exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and composed chitin arthropods spiders ticks shrimps crabs lobsters calcium carbonate constitutes the shells molluscs brachiopods and some building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria other invertebrates may have rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete variety surface coatings such the pinacoderm the gelatinous cuticle cnidarians polyps sea anemones jellyfish and the collagenous cuticle annelids the outer epithelial layer may include cells several types including sensory gland cells and stinging there may also protrusions such microvilli cilia bristles spines and tubercles arthropod anatomy arthropod spider anatomy insect morphology arthropods comprise the largest phylum the animal kingdom with over million known invertebrate insects possess segmented bodies supported jointed outer the exoskeleton made mostly the segments the body are organized into three distinct thorax and abdomen the head typically bears pair sensory antennae pair compound eyes one three simple eyes ocelli and three sets modified appendages that form the mouthparts the thorax has three pairs segmented legs one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one two pairs wings the abdomen composed eleven some which may fused and houses the digestive respiratory excretory and reproductive there considerable variations between species and many adaptations the body especially legs antennae and other branches anatomy superficial surface anatomy important the study anatomical landmarks that can readily seen from the exterior contours the enables physicians veterinary surgeons gauge the position and anatomy the associated deeper superficial directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close the surface the comparative anatomy relates the comparison anatomical structures both gross and different artistic anatomy relates anatomic studies for artistic history history

academic teaching the sciences underlying including especially this system lasted until the reform medical training and well collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum comparative anatomy published over research and became famous for his public dissection the tay whale from the royal college surgeons regulated the teaching anatomy medical medical museums provided examples comparative and were often used ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and discovered how was noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often mothers examined medical students than the students went from the dissecting room the hospital ward and examined women semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands chlorinated lime before each clinical the incidence puerperal fever among the mothers could reduced before the era modern medical the main means for studying the internal structure the body were palpation and dissection was the advent microscopy that opened understanding the building blocks that constituted living technical advances the development achromatic lenses increased the resolving power the microscope and around matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit organization all living study small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented provide sufficiently thin slices tissue staining techniques using artificial dyes were established help distinguish between different types the fields cytology and histology developed from here the late the invention the electron microscope brought great advance resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure cells and the organelles and other structures within about the same the the use ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise new field molecular anatomy short wavelength electromagnetic radiation such rays can passed through the body and are used medical radiography view interior structures which have different degrees nowadays modern techniques such magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging have enabled researchers and practitioners examine living unprecedented they are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and provide information the internal structures and organs the body degree
