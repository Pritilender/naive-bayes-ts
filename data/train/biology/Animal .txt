classification see also references bibliography external links etymology the word animal comes from the latin word animalis meaning having breath everyday colloquial usage the word incorrectly excludes humans that animal often used refer only human members the kingdom sometimes only closer relatives humans such mammals and other vertebrates are meant colloquial the biological definition the word refers all members the kingdom encompassing creatures diverse sponges jellyfish insects and humans characteristics animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living animals are eukaryotic and multicellular which separates them from bacteria and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food internal which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from algae and fungi lacking rigid cell walls all animals are motile only certain life most embryos pass through blastula stage which characteristic exclusive structure with few most notably the sponges phylum porifera and placozoa animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues these include muscles which are able contract and control and nerve tissues which send and process typically there also internal digestive chamber with one two animals with this sort organization are called eumetazoans when the former used for animals all animals have eukaryotic cells surrounded characteristic extracellular matrix composed collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may calcified form structures like shells bones and spicules during forms relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and making complex structures other multicellular organisms like plants and have cells held place cell and develop progressive also unique animal cells are the following intercellular tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes reproduction and development sexual reproduction animals asexual reproduction examples animals newt lung cell stained fluorescent dyes anaphase mitosis nearly all animals undergo some form sexual reproduction they have few specialized reproductive cells which undergo meiosis produce motile spermatozoa non motile ova these fuse form zygotes which develop into new many animals are also capable asexual reproduction this may take place through parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without budding fragmentation zygote initially develops into hollow called blastula which undergoes rearrangement and blastula larvae swim new location and develop into new most other the blastula undergoes more complicated first invaginates form gastrula with digestive and two separate germ layers external ectoderm and internal endoderm most mesoderm also develops between these germ layers then differentiate form tissues and food and energy sourcing animal nutrition all animals are heterotrophs meaning that they feed directly indirectly other living they are often further subdivided into groups such carnivores herbivores omnivores and parasites predation biological interaction where predator heterotroph that feeds its prey the organism that predators may may not kill their prey prior feeding but the act predation almost always results the death the the other main category consumption detritivory the consumption dead organic matter can times difficult separate the two feeding behaviours for where parasitic species prey host organism and then lay their eggs for their offspring feed its decaying selective pressures imposed one another has led evolutionary arms race between prey and resulting various antipredator adaptations most animals indirectly use the energy sunlight eating plants eating most plants use light convert inorganic molecules their environment into carbohydrates fats proteins and other characteristically containing reduced carbon the form hydrogen starting with carbon dioxide and water photosynthesis converts the energy sunlight into chemical energy the form simple sugars glucose with the release molecular oxygen these sugars are then used the building blocks for plant including the production other when animal eats plants eats other animals which have eaten the reduced carbon compounds the food become source energy and building materials for the they are either used directly help the animal broken releasing stored solar and giving the animal the energy required for animals living close hydrothermal vents and cold seeps the ocean floor are not dependent the energy instead chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria form the base the food chain origin and fossil record urmetazoan dunkleosteus prehistoric fish animals are generally considered have evolved from flagellated eukaryote their closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates collared flagellates that have morphology similar the choanocytes certain molecular studies place animals supergroup called the opisthokonts which also include the fungi and few small parasitic protists the name comes from the posterior location the flagellum motile such most animal whereas other eukaryotes tend have anterior the first fossils that might represent animals appear the trezona formation trezona west central south these fossils are interpreted being early they were found old the next oldest possible animal fossils are found towards the end the precambrian around million years and are known the ediacaran vendian biota these are difficult relate later however some may represent precursors modern but they may separate and possible they are not really animals aside from most known animal phyla make more less simultaneous appearance during the cambrian period about million years still disputed whether this called the cambrian explosion due rapid divergence between different groups due change conditions that made fossilization some paleontologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than the cambrian possibly early billion years trace fossils such tracks and burrows found the tonian era indicate the presence triploblastic worms like roughly large about and complex earthworms during the beginning the tonian period around billion years there was decrease stromatolite diversity which may indicate the appearance grazing since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals went extinct the end permian and end ordovician extinction and decreased shortly after the grazer populations however the discovery that tracks very similar these early trace fossils are produced today the giant celled protist gromia sphaerica casts doubt their interpretation evidence early animal groups animals porifera placozoa cnidaria and bilateria phylogenetic analysis suggests that the porifera and ctenophora diverged before clade parahoxozoa that gave rise the bilateria cnidaria and placozoa another study based the absence introns suggests that porifera and placozoa may sister group bilateria and study and study both using entirely distinct that the cladogram animals choanoflagellata animal ctenophora porifera placozoa cnidaria bilateria agelas clathrodes sea fan iciligorgia schrammi plexaurella nutans the sponges porifera were long thought have diverged from other animals they lack the complex organization found most other their cells are but most cases not organized into distinct sponges typically feed drawing water through archaeocyatha which have fused may represent sponges separate however phylogenomic study genes animals across phyla revealed that the ctenophora comb jellies which are the basal lineage least among those phyla the authors speculate that least those lines sponges they are not but may instead secondarily among the other the ctenophora and the cnidaria which includes sea anemones corals and jellyfish are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with single which serves both the mouth and the both have distinct but they are not organized into organs there are only two main germ the ectoderm and with only scattered cells between these animals are sometimes called diploblastic the tiny placozoans are but they not have permanent digestive the remaining animals form monophyletic group called the bilateria for the most they are bilaterally symmetric and often have specialized head with feeding and sensory the body triploblastic all three germ layers are and tissues form distinct the digestive chamber has two mouth and and there also internal body cavity called coelom there are exceptions each these however for instance adult echinoderms are radially and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding the relationships within the most appear belong two major the deuterostomes and the protostomes the latter which includes the ecdysozoa platyzoa and lophotrochozoa there are few small groups bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear have diverged before these major these include the acoelomorpha rhombozoa and orthonectida the myxozoa single celled parasites that were originally considered are now believed have developed from the medusozoa deuterostomes superb wren malurus cyaneus deuterostomes differ from the other called protostomes several both cases there complete digestive however the first opening the gut appear embryological development the archenteron develops into the with the anus forming deuterostomes the anus forms with the mouth developing most cells simply fill the interior the gastrula form the called schizocoelous but forms through invagination the called enterocoelic deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell while protostomes undergo spiral all this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are monophyletic the main phyla deuterostomes are the echinodermata and chordata the former are radially symmetric and exclusively such starfish sea urchins and sea cucumbers the latter are dominated the vertebrates animals with these include fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals addition the deuterostomes also include the hemichordata acorn although they are not especially prominent the important fossil graptolites may belong this the chaetognatha arrow worms may also but more recent studies suggest protostome ecdysozoa winged darter sympetrum flaveolum the ecdysozoa are named after the common trait growth moulting ecdysis the largest animal phylum belongs the arthropoda including spiders crabs and their all these organisms have body divided into repeating typically with paired two smaller the onychophora and tardigrada are close relatives the arthropods and share these the ecdysozoans also include the nematoda perhaps the second largest animal roundworms are typically and occur nearly every environment where there number are important smaller phyla related them are the nematomorpha horsehair and the kinorhyncha priapulida and loricifera these groups have reduced called the remaining two groups protostomes are sometimes grouped together the spiralia since both embryos develop with spiral cleavage platyzoa pseudobiceros bedfordi the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes the these were originally considered some the most primitive but now appears they developed from more complex number parasites are included this such the flukes and tapeworms flatworms are acoelomates lacking body are their closest the microscopic gastrotricha the other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate the most prominent are the rotifera which are common aqueous they also include the acanthocephala headed the gnathostomulida micrognathozoa and possibly the cycliophora these groups share the presence complex from which they are called the gnathifera lophotrochozoa roman snail helix pomatia the lophotrochozoa evolved within include two the most successful animal the mollusca and annelida the which the largest animal phylum number described includes animals such snails clams and squids and the latter comprises the segmented such earthworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because the common presence trochophore larvae but the annelids were considered closer the arthropods because they are both now this generally considered convergent evolution owing many morphological and genetic differences between the two the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea ribbon the sipuncula and several phyla that have ring ciliated tentacles around the called lophophore these were traditionally grouped together the but now appears that the lophophorate group may paraphyletic with some closer the nemerteans and some the molluscs and they include the brachiopoda lamp which are prominent the fossil the entoprocta the phoronida and possibly the bryozoa moss model organisms model organism animal testing because the great diversity found more economical for scientists study small number chosen species that connections can drawn from their work and conclusions extrapolated about how animals function because they are easy keep and the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms and were among the first forms genetically this was facilitated the severely reduced state their genomes but many genes introns and linkages lost these ecdysozoans can teach little about the origins animals the extent this type evolution within the superphylum will revealed the annelid and molluscan genome projects currently analysis the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasised the importance placozoans and choanoflagellates also being explaining the arrival ancestral genes unique the analysis the homoscleromorph sponge oscarella carmela also suggests that the last common ancestor sponges and the eumetazoan animals was more complex than previously other model organisms belonging the animal kingdom include the house mouse mus musculus and zebrafish danio rerio carolus linnaeus taxonomy history classification aristotle divided the living world between animals and and this was followed carolus linnaeus carl von the first hierarchical since then biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary and these groups have been restricted for microscopic protozoa were originally considered animals because they but are now treated original the animals were one three divided into the classes vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into single the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated the above lists represent our current understanding the though there some variation from source see also animal animal
