microfluidic device see also references external links discovery and name origin the plant was first described the harz mountains johannes thal physician from nordhausen ringen germany who called pilosella siliquosa carl linnaeus renamed the plant arabis thaliana honor the german botanist gustav heynhold erected the new genus arabidopsis and placed the plant that the genus arabidopsis comes from greek meaning resembling arabis the genus which linnaeus had initially placed habitat morphology and life cycle arabidopsis native asia and northwestern also appears native tropical afroalpine annual rarely biennial plant usually growing the leaves form rosette the base the with few leaves also the flowering the basal leaves are green slightly purplish long and with entire coarsely serrated the stem leaves are smaller and usually with entire leaves are covered with unicellular hairs called trichomes the flowers are arranged corymb their structure that the typical brassicaceae the fruit siliqua containing seeds roots are simple with single primary root that grows vertically later producing smaller lateral these roots form interactions with rhizosphere bacteria such bacillus megaterium arabidopsis can complete its entire lifecycle six the central stem that produces flowers grows after about three and the flowers naturally the arabidopsis may grown petri pots under fluorescent lights distribution this section requires expansion june australia common garden weed nsw ireland said occasional however other references note recorded from throughout frequently found belfast use model organism botanists and biologists began research thaliana the early and the first systematic collection its mutations was performed around now widely used for studying plant sciences including genetics evolution population and plant plays the role plant biology that mice and fruit flies drosophila play animal although thaliana has little direct significance for has several traits that make useful model for understanding the cellular and molecular biology flowering the small size its genome and the fact that diploid makes arabidopsis thaliana useful for genetic mapping and sequencing with about mega base pairs and five chromosomes arabidopsis has one the smallest genomes among was the first plant genome completed the arabidopsis genome the most date version the thaliana genome maintained the arabidopsis information resource much work has been done assign functions its genes and the proteins they post genomic such has also provided useful insights the metabolism this species and how environmental perturbations can affect metabolic the small size and rapid lifecycle are also advantageous for having specialized spring ephemeral has been used found several laboratory strains that take about six weeks from germination mature the small size the plant convenient for cultivation small and produces many further the selfing nature this plant assists genetic also individual plant can produce several thousand each the above criteria leads thaliana being valued genetic model plant transformation arabidopsis using agrobacterium tumefaciens transfer dna the plant the current termed involves simply dipping flower into solution containing agrobacterium the dna and this method avoids the need for tissue culture plant the arabidopsis gene knockout collections are unique resource for plant biology made possible the availability throughput transformation and funding for genomics the site dna insertions has been determined for over independent transgenic with the information and seeds accessible through online dna databases through these insertional mutants are available for most genes arabidopsis the plant well suited for light microscopy analysis young seedlings the and their roots are relatively this together with their small facilitates live cell imaging using both fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy mounting seedlings water culture plants may imaged obviating the need for fixation and sectioning and allowing time lapse measurements fluorescent protein constructs can introduced through transformation the developmental stage each cell can inferred from its location the plant using fluorescent protein markers allowing detailed developmental analysis tair and nasc are curated sources for diverse arabidopsis genetic and molecular biology and also provide numerous for databases that store the results hundreds wide gene expression profile seed and dna stocks can obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre the arabidopsis biological resource center history research the first mutant arabidopsis was documented alexander braun describing double flower phenotype the mutated gene was likely agamous cloned and characterized however not until did friedrich laibach who had published the chromosome number propose arabidopsis model his erna published her thesis arabidopsis describing the first collection arabidopsis mutants that they generated using ray mutagenesis laibach continued his important contributions arabidopsis research collecting large number ecotypes with the help albert these were organised into the current ecotype collection natural accessions thaliana from around the the and john langridge and george dei played important role establishing arabidopsis useful organism for biological laboratory dei wrote several scholarly reviews instrumental introducing the model the scientific the start the arabidopsis research community dates newsletter called arabidopsis information service established the first international arabidopsis conference was held ttingen germany the arabidopsis started become widely used plant research laboratories around the was one several candidates that included maize petunia and tobacco the latter two were since they were easily transformable with the current while maize was established genetic model for plant the breakthrough year for arabidopsis the preferred model plant came when dna mediated transformation was first and this coincided with the first gene cloned and published characterized ecotypes and mutant lines arabidopsis serve experimental material laboratory the most commonly used background lines are landsberg and other background lines often cited the scientific literature are cvi cape verde nossen etc see for series named col have been obtained and mutant lines are available through stock which known are the nottingham arabidopsis stock nasc and the arabidopsis biological resource abrc usa the col columbia ecotype was agronomically performant within population seeds named landsberg received from columbia the ecotype sequenced the arabidopsis genome the landsberg erecta line was selected dei from within landsberg population which had performed some ray mutagenesis the collection mutants derived from this initial does not correspond the landsberg which named research arabidopsis flower development arabidopsis has been extensively studied model for flower the developing flower has four basic sepals petals stamens and carpels which form pistils these organs are arranged series four sepals the outer followed four petals inside six and central carpel homeotic mutations arabidopsis result the change one organ another the case the agamous mutation for stamens become petals and carpels are replaced with new resulting recursively repeated petal observations homeotic mutations led the formulation the abc model flower development coen and meyerowitz according this floral organ identity genes are divided into three class genes which affect sepals and class genes which affect petals and and class genes which affect stamens and these genes code for transcription factors that combine cause tissue specification their respective regions during although developed through study arabidopsis this model generally applicable other flowering plants light sensing the photoreceptors phytochromes and mediate red based phototropic understanding the function these receptors has helped plant biologists understand the signalling cascades that regulate photoperiodism germination etiolation and shade avoidance the uvr protein detects light and mediates response this dna damaging arabidopsis was used extensively the study the genetic basis phototropism chloroplast alignment and stomatal aperture and other blue influenced these traits respond blue which perceived the phototropin light arabidopsis has also been important understanding the functions another blue light cryptochrome which especially important for light entrainment control the circadian rhythms light response was even found which were thought not particularly sensitive while gravitropic response arabidopsis root organs their predominant tropic specimens treated with mutagens and selected for the absence gravitropic action showed negative phototropic response blue white and positive response red indicating that the roots also show positive light emitting janet braam rice university genetically engineered arabidopsis glow the dark when the effect was visible ultrasensitive crowd funding project kickstarter offered deliver seeds genetically engineered glow the arabidopsis its the plants are expected give off dim non mendelian inheritance scientists purdue university proposed that arabidopsis possessed alternative previously known mechanisms dna repair which one scientist called parallel path inheritance was observed mutations the hothead gene plants mutant this gene exhibit organ and pollen can germinate all plant not just the stigma after spending over year eliminating simpler was indicated that the plants cached versions their genes going back least four and used these records templates correct the hothead mutation and other single nucleotide polymorphisms the initial hypothesis proposed the record may rna based since alternative models have been proposed which would explain the phenotype without requiring new model more the whole phenomenon being challenged being simple artifact pollen when jacobsen took great pains isolate the reproduce the phenomenon notes steven henikoff response the new lolle and pruitt agree that peng did observe but note that some their own such double reversions both mutant genes the regular cannot explained plant pathogen interactions important understand how plants achieve resistance protect the food well the agriculture many model systems have been developed better understand interactions between plants and bacterial fungal oomycete viral and nematode pathogens arabidopsis thaliana has been successfully implemented the study the subdicipline plant pathology that the interaction between plants and causing pathogens arabidopsis thaliana bacteria pseudomonas syringae xanthomonas campestris fungi colletotrichum destructivum botrytis cinerea golovinomyces orontii oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis viral cauliflower mosaic virus tomato mosaic virus nematode meloidogyne incognita heterodera schachtii the use arabidopsis has led many breakthroughs the advancement knowledge how plants manifest plant disease resistance the reason most plants are resistant most pathogens through nonhost this not all pathogens will infect all example where arabidopsis was used determine the genes responsible for nonhost resistance blumeria graminis the causal agent powdery mildew arabidopsis mutants were developed using the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate and screened determine which mutants had increased infection graminis the mutants with higher infection rates are referred pen mutants due the ability graminis penetrate arabidopsis begin the disease the pen genes were later mapped identify the genes responsible for nonhost resistance graminis components pathogen recognition arabidopsis thaliana thaliana thaliana when plant exposed nonpathogenic microbe there initial known triggered immunity because the plant detects conserved motifs known pathogen associated molecular patterns these pamps are detected specialized receptors the host known pattern recognition receptors the plant cell the characterized prr thaliana which recognizes bacterial flagellin specialized organelle used microorganisms for the purpose well the ligand flg which comprises the amino acids recognized discovery was facilitated the identification thaliana ecotype that was unable detect leading the identification the gene encoding second receptor identified thaliana recognizes the bacterial protein the prokaryotic elongation factor used protein synthesis well the used ligand using agrobacterium mediated transformation technique that takes advantage the natural process which agrobacterium transfers genes into host the efr gene was transformed into nicotiana benthamiana tobacco plant that does not recognize thereby permitting recognition bacterial thereby confirming efr the receptor both and efr use similar signal transduction pathways initiate thaliana has been instrumental dissecting these pathways better understand the regulation immune the most notable one being the mitogen activated protein kinase map cascade downstream responses pti include callose deposition the oxidative burst and transcription related pti able combat pathogens nonspecific stronger and more specific response plants that triggered immunity eti dependent upon the recognition pathogen proteins secreted the pathogen that alter functions the plant resistance genes often described gene relationship this recognition may occur directly indirectly via guardee protein hypothesis known the guard hypothesis the first gene cloned thaliana was resistance pseudomonas syringe which responsible for recognition the effector the bacterial effector delivered into thaliana via the type iii secretion system syringae tomato strain recognition occurs via the guardee protein which cleaved recognition pathogen effector leads dramatic immune response known the hypersensitive response which the infected plant cells undergo cell death prevent the spread the systemic acquired resistance another example resistance that better understood plants because research done thaliana benzothiadiazol salicylic acid analog has been used historically antifungal compound crop bth well has been shown induce sar the initiation the sar pathway was first demonstrated thaliana which increased levels are recognized nonexpresser genes due redox change the resulting the reduction npr which usually exists multiplex state becomes monomeric single upon when becomes translocates the were interacts with many tga transcription factors and able induce related genes such meiosis rad like proteins have been identified eukaryotes from yeast these like proteins catalyze key steps recombinational repair dna recombinational repair particularly important for removing strand damages during thaliana mutant defective gene rad homologue xrcc hypersensitive mitomycin dna interstrand crosslinking agent implying deficiency repair these strand damages somatic the xrcc mutants are also deficient meiotic recombination and are indicating that xrcc also plays essential role thus likely that thaliana mediated recombinational repair dna damage active somatic cells and essential during self pollination thaliana predominantly pollinating plant with outcrossing rate estimated less than analysis the wide pattern linkage disequilibrium suggested that pollination evolved roughly million years ago meioses that lead pollination are unlikely produce significant beneficial genetic however these meioses can provide the adaptive benefit recombinational repair dna damages during formation germ cells each such benefit may have been sufficient allow the term persistence meioses even when followed physical mechanism for pollination arabidopsis through significant cleistogamy during flower development such that fertilisation takes place
