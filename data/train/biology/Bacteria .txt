from the atmosphere and putrefaction the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps bacteria provide the nutrients needed sustain life converting dissolved compounds such hydrogen sulphide and methane march researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive the mariana trench the deepest spot the other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks feet below the sea floor under feet ocean off the coast the northwestern united according one the you can find microbes they extremely adaptable and survive wherever they most bacteria have not been and only about half the phyla bacteria have species that can grown the the study bacteria known bacteriology branch microbiology there are approximately ten times many bacterial cells the human flora there are human cells the with the largest number the human flora being the gut flora and large number the skin the vast majority the bacteria the body are rendered harmless the protective effects the immune system and some are beneficial however several species bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases including cholera syphilis anthrax leprosy and bubonic plague the most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections with tuberculosis alone killing about million people mostly sub saharan africa developed countries antibiotics are used treat bacterial infections and are also used making antibiotic resistance growing bacteria are important sewage treatment and the breakdown oil spills the production cheese and yogurt through fermentation and the recovery palladium copper and other metals the mining well biotechnology and the manufacture antibiotics and other once regarded plants constituting the class schizomycetes bacteria are now classified prokaryotes unlike cells animals and other eukaryotes bacterial cells not contain nucleus and rarely harbour membrane bound organelles although the term bacteria traditionally included all the scientific classification changed after the discovery the that prokaryotes consist two very different groups organisms that evolved from ancient common these evolutionary domains are called bacteria and archaea contents etymology origin and early evolution morphology cellular structure intracellular structures extracellular structures endospores metabolism growth and reproduction genetics dna transfer bacteriophages behavior secretion bioluminescence multicellularity movement classification and identification interactions with other organisms predators mutualists pathogens significance technology and industry history bacteriology see also references further reading external links etymology the word bacteria the plural the new latin bacterium which the latinisation the greek bakterion the diminutive bakteria meaning cane because the first ones discovered were origin and early evolution timeline evolution evolutionary history life the ancestors modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms life appear about billion years for about billion all organisms were and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms although bacterial fossils exist such stromatolites their lack distinctive morphology prevents them from being used examine the history bacterial date the time origin particular bacterial however gene sequences can used reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the eukaryotic bacteria were also involved the second great evolutionary that the archaea and here eukaryotes resulted from the entering ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors eukaryotic which were themselves possibly related the archaea this involved the engulfment eukaryotic cells proteobacterial symbionts form either mitochondria hydrogenosomes which are still found all known eukarya sometimes highly reduced form ancient amitochondrial protozoa later some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed like this led the formation chloroplasts algae and there are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic here eukaryotes engulfed eukaryotic algae that developed into plastid this known secondary endosymbiosis morphology bacterial cellular morphologies morphologies bacteria display wide diversity shapes and called morphologies bacterial cells are about tenth the size eukaryotic cells and are typically micrometres however few for thiomargarita namibiensis and epulopiscium fishelsoni are half millimetre long and are visible the unaided fishelsoni reaches among the smallest bacteria are members the genus mycoplasma which measure only small the largest viruses some bacteria may even but these ultramicrobacteria are not most bacterial species are either called cocci sing coccus from greek kkos grain seed called bacilli sing bacillus from latin baculus stick elongation associated with some called vibrio are shaped like slightly curved rods others can called spirilla tightly called spirochaetes small number species even have tetrahedral cuboidal more bacteria were discovered deep under crust that grow branching filamentous types with shaped the large surface area volume ratio this morphology may give these bacteria advantage poor this wide variety shapes determined the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton and important because can influence the ability bacteria acquire attach swim through liquids and escape predators biofilm mickey hot springs oregon many bacterial species exist simply single others associate characteristic neisseria form diploids streptococcus form and staphylococcus group together bunch clusters bacteria can also elongated form for example the actinobacteria filamentous bacteria are often surrounded sheath that contains many individual certain such species the genus nocardia even form branched similar appearance fungal mycelia prokaryotes biomolecules bacteria often attach surfaces and form dense aggregations called biofilms bacterial mats these films can range from few micrometers thickness half meter and may contain multiple species protists and archaea bacteria living biofilms display complex arrangement cells and extracellular forming secondary structures such through which there are networks channels enable better diffusion natural such soil the surfaces the majority bacteria are bound surfaces biofilms are also important these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections infections implanted medical devices and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder kill than individual isolated even more complex morphological changes are sometimes for when starved amino myxobacteria detect surrounding cells process known quorum sensing migrate toward each and aggregate form fruiting bodies micrometres long and containing approximately bacterial these fruiting the bacteria perform separate this type cooperation simple type multicellular organisation for about one cells migrate the top these fruiting bodies and differentiate into specialised dormant state called which are more resistant drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cellular structure bacterial cell structure gram positive one intracellular structures the bacterial cell surrounded lipid membrane also known cell membrane plasma membrane this membrane encloses the contents the cell and acts barrier hold proteins and other essential components the cytoplasm within the they are prokaryotes bacteria not usually have bound organelles their and thus contain few large intracellular they lack true nucleus mitochondria chloroplasts and the other organelles present eukaryotic bacteria were once seen simple bags but structures such the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization proteins specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been these subcellular levels organization have been called bacterial micro compartments such carboxysomes provide further level they are compartments within bacteria that are surrounded polyhedral protein rather than lipid these polyhedral localize and compartmentalize bacterial function performed the bound organelles many important biochemical reactions such energy generation use concentration gradients across the general lack internal membranes bacteria means reactions such electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space however many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane highly folded and fills most the cell with layers gathering these gathering complexes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes green sulfur bacteria other proteins import nutrients across the cell expel undesired molecules from the carboxysomes electron microscope halothiobacillus neapolitanus most bacteria not have bound and their genetic material typically single circular chromosome located the cytoplasm irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid the nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and rna the phylum planctomycetes are exception the general absence internal membranes because they have double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other bound cellular like all living organisms bacteria contain ribosomes often grouped chains called polyribosomes for the production but the structure the bacterial ribosome different from that eukaryotes and archaea bacterial ribosomes have sedimentation rate measured svedberg units their subunits have rates and some antibiotics bind specifically ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger ribosomes eukaryotic cells and without harming the some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules for later such glycogen polyphosphate sulfur polyhydroxyalkanoates certain bacterial such the photosynthetic cyanobacteria produce internal gas which they use regulate their allowing them move down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found membranes phototrophic bacteria used primarily for they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes but these were later shown artifacts produced the chemicals used prepare the cells for electron inclusions are considered nonliving components the cell that not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded the most common inclusions are lipid crystals and volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions complexed inorganic these granules are called metachromatic granules due their displaying the metachromatic they appear red blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue toluidine gas vacuoles which are freely permeable are bound vesicles present some species cyanobacteria they allow the bacteria control their microcompartments are membrane bound organelles that are made protein shell that surrounds and encloses various carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved carbon magnetosomes are bacterial present magnetotactic bacteria that contain magnetic extracellular structures cell envelope most cell wall present the outside the cytoplasmic the plasma membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope common bacterial cell wall material peptidoglycan called murein older which made from polysaccharide chains linked peptides containing amino acids bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls plants and fungi which are made cellulose and chitin respectively the cell wall bacteria also distinct from that which not contain the cell wall essential the survival many and the antibiotic penicillin able kill bacteria inhibiting step the synthesis there are broadly speaking two different types cell wall thick one the gram positives and thinner one the gram negatives the names originate from the reaction cells the gram stain test employed for the classification bacterial gram positive bacteria possess thick cell wall containing many layers peptidoglycan and teichoic acids gram negative bacteria have relatively thin cell wall consisting few layers peptidoglycan surrounded second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins lipopolysaccharides also called endotoxins are composed polysaccharides and lipid that responsible for much the toxicity negative most bacteria have the negative cell and only the firmicutes and actinobacteria have the alternative positive these two groups were previously known the low and high positive respectively these differences structure can produce differences antibiotic for vancomycin can kill only positive bacteria and ineffective against negative pathogens such haemophilus influenzae pseudomonas aeruginosa the bacterial cell wall entirely called protoplast whereas partially called spheroplast lactam antibiotics such penicillin inhibit the formation peptidoglycan links the bacterial cell the enzyme lysozyme found human also digests the cell wall bacteria and the main defense against eye acid fast bacteria such mycobacteria are resistant decolorization acids during staining procedures the high mycolic acid content mycobacteria responsible for the staining pattern poor absorption followed high the most common staining technique used identify fast bacteria the ziehl neelsen stain fast which the fast bacilli are stained red and stand out clearly against blue form bacteria are strains bacteria that lack cell the main pathogenic bacteria this class mycoplasma not confused with mycobacteria many layer rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside the this layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act macromolecular diffusion barrier layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood but are known act virulence factors campylobacter and contain surface enzymes bacillus stearothermophilus helicobacter pylori flagella are rigid protein about nanometres diameter and micrometres that are used for motility flagella are driven the energy released the transfer ions down electrochemical gradient across the cell fimbriae sometimes called attachment pili are fine filaments usually nanometres diameter and several micrometers they are distributed over the surface the and resemble fine hairs when seen under the electron microscope fimbriae are believed involved attachment solid surfaces other and are essential for the virulence some bacterial pili sing pilus are cellular slightly larger than that can transfer genetic material between bacterial cells process called conjugation where they are called conjugation pili sex pili see bacterial below they can also generate movement where they are called type pili see below glycocalyx are produced many bacteria surround their and vary structural ranging from disorganised slime layer cellular polymer highly structured capsule these structures can protect cells from engulfment eukaryotic cells such macrophages part the human immune system they can also act antigens and involved cell well aiding attachment surfaces and the formation the assembly these extracellular structures dependent bacterial secretion systems these transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm into the environment around the many types secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the virulence are intensively endospores endospores bacillus anthracis cerebrospinal fluid certain genera positive such bacillus clostridium sporohalobacter anaerobacter and heliobacterium can form highly dormant structures called endospores almost all one endospore formed and this not reproductive although anaerobacter can make seven endospores single endospores have central core cytoplasm containing dna and ribosomes surrounded cortex layer and protected impermeable and rigid dipicolinic acid chemical compound that composes the dry weight bacterial implicated responsible for the heat resistance the endospores show detectable metabolism and can survive extreme physical and chemical such high levels light gamma radiation detergents disinfectants heat freezing pressure and desiccation this dormant these organisms may remain viable for millions and endospores even allow bacteria survive exposure the vacuum and radiation according scientist steinn there are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are million years old and know very hardened endospore forming bacteria can also cause for anthrax can contracted the inhalation bacillus anthracis endospores and contamination deep puncture wounds with clostridium tetani endospores causes tetanus metabolism microbial metabolism bacteria exhibit extremely wide variety metabolic types the distribution metabolic traits within group bacteria has traditionally been used define their taxonomy but these traits often not correspond with modern genetic bacterial metabolism classified into nutritional groups the basis three major the kind energy used for the source carbon and the electron donors used for additional criterion respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic anaerobic respiration phototrophs cyanobacteria green sulfur bacteria chloroflexi purple bacteria lithotrophs thermodesulfobacteria hydrogenophilaceae nitrospirae organotrophs bacillus clostridium enterobacteriaceae carbon metabolism bacteria either heterotrophic where organic carbon compounds are used carbon autotrophic meaning that cellular carbon obtained fixing carbon dioxide heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria green bacteria and some purple bacteria but also many chemolithotrophic such nitrifying oxidising energy metabolism bacteria either based phototrophy the use light through photosynthesis based chemotrophy the use chemical substances for which are mostly oxidised the expense oxygen alternative electron acceptors anaerobic photosynthetic cyanobacteria bacteria are further divided into lithotrophs that use inorganic electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds electron chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation anaerobic respiration and biosynthetic reactions carbon dioxide whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic respiratory organisms use chemical compounds source energy taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them terminal electron acceptor redox reaction this reaction releases energy that can used synthesise atp and drive aerobic organisms oxygen used the electron anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds such nitrate sulfate carbon dioxide are used electron this leads the ecologically important processes denitrification sulfate and acetogenesis respectively another way life chemotrophs the absence possible electron acceptors wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred oxidised intermediates generate reduced fermentation products lactate ethanol hydrogen butyric acid fermentation because the energy content the substrates higher than that the which allows the organisms synthesise atp and drive their these processes are also important biological responses pollution for sulfate reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production the highly toxic forms mercury methyl and dimethylmercury the non respiratory anaerobes use fermentation generate energy and reducing secreting metabolic products such ethanol facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending the environmental conditions which they find lithotrophic bacteria can use inorganic compounds source common inorganic electron donors are carbon monoxide ammonia leading nitrification ferrous iron and other reduced metal and several reduced sulfur compounds unusual the gas methane can used methanotrophic bacteria both source electrons and substrate for carbon anabolism both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy oxygen used terminal electron whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used most lithotrophic organisms are whereas organotrophic organisms are addition fixing carbon dioxide some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas nitrogen fixation using the enzyme nitrogenase this environmentally important trait can found bacteria nearly all the metabolic types listed but not regardless the type metabolic process they the majority bacteria are able take raw materials only the form relatively small which enter the cell diffusion through molecular channels cell the planctomycetes are the exception they are possessing membranes around their nuclear has recently been shown that gemmata obscuriglobus able take large molecules via process that some ways resembles endocytosis the process used eukaryotic cells engulf external growth and reproduction binary fission mitosis meiosis bacterial growth unlike multicellular increases cell size cell growth and reproduction cell division are tightly linked unicellular bacteria grow fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission form asexual reproduction under optimal bacteria can grow and divide extremely and bacterial populations can double quickly every cell two identical clone daughter cells are some while still reproducing form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter examples include fruiting body formation myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation streptomyces budding involves cell forming protrusion that breaks away and produces daughter escherichia coli the bacteria are usually grown using solid liquid solid growth media such agar plates are used isolate pure cultures bacterial however liquid growth media are used when measurement growth large volumes cells are growth stirred liquid media occurs even cell making the cultures easy divide and although isolating single bacteria from liquid media the use selective media media with specific nutrients added with antibiotics can help identify specific most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels nutrients produce large amounts cells cheaply and however natural nutrients are meaning that bacteria cannot continue reproduce this nutrient limitation has led the evolution different growth strategies see selection theory some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become such the formation algal and blooms that often occur lakes during the other organisms have adaptations harsh such the production multiple antibiotics streptomyces that inhibit the growth competing many organisms live communities biofilms that may allow for increased supply nutrients and protection from environmental these relationships can essential for growth particular organism group organisms syntrophy bacterial growth follows four when population bacteria first enter nutrient environment that allows the cells need adapt their new the first phase growth the lag phase period slow growth when the cells are adapting the nutrient environment and preparing for fast the lag phase has high biosynthesis proteins necessary for rapid growth are the second phase growth the log phase also known the logarithmic exponential phase the log phase marked rapid exponential growth the rate which cells grow during this phase known the growth rate and the time takes the cells double known the generation time during log nutrients are metabolised maximum speed until one the nutrients depleted and starts limiting the third phase growth the stationary phase and caused depleted the cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume essential cellular the stationary phase transition from rapid growth stress response state and there increased expression genes involved dna repair antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport the final phase the death phase where the bacteria runs out nutrients and genetics plasmid genome most bacteria have single circular chromosome that can range size from only base pairs the endosymbiotic bacteria candidatus carsonella ruddii base pairs the dwelling bacteria sorangium cellulosum spirochaetes the genus borrelia are notable exception this with bacteria such borrelia burgdorferi the cause lyme disease containing single linear the genes bacterial genomes are usually single continuous stretch dna and although several different types introns exist these are much more rare than bacteria may also contain plasmids which are small chromosomal dnas that may contain genes for antibiotic resistance virulence factors bacteria asexual inherit identical copies their genes they are clonal however all bacteria can evolve selection changes their genetic material dna caused genetic recombination mutations mutations come from errors made during the replication dna from exposure mutagens mutation rates vary widely among different species bacteria and even among different clones single species genetic changes bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication directed where genes involved particular limiting process have increased mutation dna transfer some bacteria also transfer genetic material between this can occur three main first bacteria can take exogenous dna from their process called transformation genes can also transferred the process transduction when the integration bacteriophage introduces foreign dna into the the third method gene transfer conjugation whereby dna transferred through direct cell transduction bacterial genes bacteriophage appears consequence infrequent errors during intracellular assembly virus rather than bacterial conjugation the studied coli system determined plasmid and adaptation for transferring copies the plasmid from one bacterial host seldom that conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial and subsequently transfers part the host bacterial dna another plasmid mediated transfer host bacterial dna also appears accidental process rather than bacterial transformation unlike transduction depends numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact perform this complex and thus transformation clearly bacterial adaptation for dna order for bacterium take and recombine donor dna into its own must first enter special physiological state termed competence see natural competence bacillus subtilis about genes are required for the development the length dna transferred during subtilis transformation can between third chromosome the whole transformation appears common among bacterial and thus far least species are known have the natural ability become competent for the development competence nature usually associated with stressful environmental and seems adaptation for facilitating repair dna damage recipient ordinary transduction conjugation and transformation involve transfer dna between individual bacteria the same but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals different bacterial species and this may have significant such the transfer antibiotic such gene acquisition from other bacteria the environment called horizontal gene transfer and may common under natural gene transfer particularly important antibiotic resistance allows the rapid transfer resistance genes between different bacteriophages bacteriophage bacteriophages are viruses that infect many types bacteriophage some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria while others insert into the bacterial bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute its phenotype for the evolution escherichia coli and clostridium botulinum the toxin genes integrated phage converted harmless ancestral bacterium into lethal bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign and system that uses crispr sequences retain fragments the genomes phage that the bacteria have come into contact with the which allows them block virus replication through form rna interference this crispr system provides bacteria with acquired immunity behavior secretion bacteria frequently secrete chemicals into their environment order modify the secretions are often proteins and may act enzymes that digest some form food the bioluminescence milky seas effect few bacteria have chemical systems that generate this bioluminescence often occurs bacteria that live association with and the light probably serves attract fish other large multicellularity prokaryote sociality bacteria often function multicellular aggregates known biofilms exchanging variety molecular signals for inter cell communication and engaging coordinated multicellular the communal benefits multicellular cooperation include cellular division accessing resources that cannot effectively utilized single collectively defending against and optimizing population survival differentiating into distinct cell for bacteria biofilms can have more than times increased resistance antibacterial agents than individual planktonic bacteria the same one type cellular communication molecular signal called quorum sensing which serves the purpose determining whether there local population density that sufficiently high that productive invest processes that are only successful large numbers similar organisms behave excreting digestive enzymes emitting quorum sensing allows bacteria coordinate gene and enables them release and detect autoinducers pheromones which accumulate with the growth cell movement chemotaxis flagellum pilus many bacteria can move using variety flagella are used for swimming through bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across and changes buoyancy allow vertical swimming bacteria frequently move near body lengths per second and few fast this makes them least fast relative bacterial gliding and twitching bacteria use their type pili grappling repeatedly extending anchoring and then retracting with remarkable force our observations redefine twitching motility highly organized mechanism bacterial translocation which pseudomonas aeruginosa can disperse itself over large areas colonize new also now both morphologically and that twitching motility and social gliding such occurs myxococcus xanthus are essentially the same examination twitching motility pseudomonas aeruginosa semmler whitchurch mattick flagella are rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller objects small bacteria operate low reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the paddle forms appropriate size bacterial species differ the number and arrangement flagella their some have single flagellum monotrichous flagellum each end amphitrichous clusters flagella the poles the cell lophotrichous while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface the cell peritrichous the bacterial flagella the understood motility structure any organism and made about proteins with approximately another proteins required for its regulation and the flagellum rotating structure driven reversible motor the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for this motor drives the motion the which acts many bacteria such coli have two distinct modes forward movement and the tumbling allows them reorient and makes their movement dimensional random walk see external links below for link the flagella unique group the spirochaetes are found between two membranes the periplasmic they have distinctive helical body that twists about motile bacteria are attracted repelled certain stimuli behaviors called taxes these include chemotaxis phototaxis energy taxis and magnetotaxis one peculiar the myxobacteria individual bacteria move together form waves cells that then differentiate form fruiting bodies containing the myxobacteria move only when solid unlike coli which motile liquid solid several listeria and shigella species move inside host cells usurping the cytoskeleton which normally used move organelles inside the promoting actin polymerization one pole their they can form kind tail that pushes them through the host classification and identification streptococcus mutans bacterial taxonomy scientific classification systematics bacterial phyla clinical pathology classification seeks describe the diversity bacterial species naming and grouping organisms based bacteria can classified the basis cell cellular metabolism differences cell components such dna fatty acids pigments antigens and quinones while these schemes allowed the identification and classification bacterial was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species between strains the same this uncertainty was due the lack distinctive structures most well lateral gene transfer between unrelated due lateral gene some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and overcome this modern bacterial classification emphasizes molecular systematics using genetic techniques such guanine cytosine ratio determination genome genome well sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene such the rrna gene classification bacteria determined publication the international journal systematic and manual systematic the international committee systematic bacteriology maintains international rules for the naming bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking them the international code nomenclature bacteria the term bacteria was traditionally applied all single cell however molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life consist two separate domains originally called eubacteria and archaebacteria but now called bacteria and archaea that evolved independently from ancient common the archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related each other than either the these two along with are the basis the three domain system which currently the most widely used classification system however due the relatively recent introduction molecular systematics and rapid increase the number genome sequences that are bacterial classification remains changing and expanding for few biologists argue that the archaea and eukaryotes evolved from positive identification bacteria the laboratory particularly relevant medicine where the correct treatment determined the bacterial species causing consequently the need identify human pathogens was major impetus for the development techniques identify phylogenetic tree eukaryotes archaea the gram stain developed hans christian gram characterises bacteria based the structural characteristics their cell the thick layers peptidoglycan the cell wall stain while the thin cell wall appears combining morphology and most bacteria can classified belonging one four groups positive gram positive gram negative cocci and negative some organisms are best identified stains other than the gram particularly mycobacteria nocardia which show acid fastness ziehl neelsen similar other organisms may need identified their growth special other such serology culture techniques are designed promote the growth and identify particular while restricting the growth the other bacteria the often these techniques are designed for specific for sputum sample will treated identify organisms that cause pneumonia while stool specimens are cultured selective media identify organisms that cause diarrhoea while preventing growth pathogenic specimens that are normally such blood urine spinal fluid are cultured under conditions designed grow all possible once pathogenic organism has been can further characterised its growth patterns such aerobic anaerobic growth patterns hemolysis and with bacterial identification bacteria increasingly using molecular diagnostics using such based such polymerase chain reaction are increasingly popular due their specificity and compared based these methods also allow the detection and identification viable but nonculturable cells that are metabolically active but however even using these improved the total number bacterial species not known and cannot even estimated with any following present there are little less than known species which includes bacteria and but attempts estimate the true number bacterial diversity have ranged from total and even these diverse estimates may off many orders interactions with other organisms despite their apparent bacteria can form complex associations with other these symbiotic associations can divided into parasitism mutualism and commensalism due their small commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow animals and plants exactly they will grow any other however their growth can increased warmth and sweat and large populations these organisms humans are the cause body odor predators some species bacteria kill and then consume other these species called predatory bacteria these include organisms such myxococcus xanthus which forms swarms cells that kill and digest any bacteria they other bacterial predators either attach their prey order digest them and absorb such vampirococcus invade another cell and multiply inside the such daptobacter these predatory bacteria are thought have evolved from saprophages that consumed dead through adaptations that allowed them entrap and kill other mutualists certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their one such mutualistic called interspecies hydrogen occurs between clusters anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids such butyric acid propionic acid and produce hydrogen and methanogenic archaea that consume the bacteria this association are unable consume the organic acids this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates their only the intimate association with the consuming archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough allow the bacteria microorganisms that reside the rhizosphere zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres the root after gentle carry out nitrogen fixation converting nitrogen gas nitrogenous this serves provide easily absorbable form nitrogen for many which cannot fix nitrogen many other bacteria are found symbionts humans and other for the presence over bacterial species the normal human gut flora the intestines can contribute gut synthesise vitamins such folic acid vitamin and biotin convert sugars lactic acid see lactobacillus well fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates the presence this gut flora also inhibits the growth potentially pathogenic bacteria usually through competitive exclusion and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold probiotic dietary supplements salmonella typhimurium pathogens pathogenic bacteria bacteria form parasitic association with other they are classed pathogenic bacteria are major cause human death and disease and cause infections such tetanus typhoid fever diphtheria syphilis cholera foodborne illness leprosy and tuberculosis pathogenic cause for known medical disease may only discovered many years was the case with helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease bacterial diseases are also important agriculture with bacteria causing leaf spot fire blight and wilts well johne disease mastitis salmonella and anthrax farm each species pathogen has characteristic spectrum interactions with its human hosts some such staphylococcus streptococcus can cause skin pneumonia meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis systemic inflammatory response producing shock massive vasodilation and yet these organisms are also part the normal human flora and usually exist the skin the nose without causing any disease other organisms invariably cause disease such the rickettsia which are obligate intracellular parasites able grow and reproduce only within the cells other one species rickettsia causes typhus while another causes rocky mountain spotted fever chlamydia another phylum obligate intracellular contains species that can cause urinary tract infection and may involved coronary heart disease finally some species such pseudomonas aeruginosa burkholderia cenocepacia and mycobacterium avium are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly people suffering from immunosuppression cystic fibrosis bacterial infections may treated with antibiotics which are classified bacteriocidal they kill bacteriostatic they just prevent bacterial there are many types antibiotics and each class inhibits process that different the pathogen from that found the example how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin which inhibit the bacterial ribosome but not the structurally different eukaryotic antibiotics are used both treating human disease and intensive farming promote animal where they may contributing the rapid development antibiotic resistance bacterial infections can prevented antiseptic measures such sterilizing the skin prior piercing with the needle and proper care indwelling surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized prevent contamination disinfectants such bleach are used kill bacteria other pathogens surfaces prevent contamination and further reduce the risk significance technology and industry economic importance bacteria often lactic acid bacteria such lactobacillus and lactococcus combination with yeasts and molds have been used for thousands years the preparation fermented foods such cheese pickles soy sauce sauerkraut vinegar wine and yogurt the ability bacteria degrade variety organic compounds remarkable and has been used waste processing and bioremediation bacteria capable digesting the hydrocarbons petroleum are often used clean oil spills fertilizer was added some the beaches prince william sound attempt promote the growth these naturally occurring bacteria after the exxon valdez oil spill these efforts were effective beaches that were not too thickly covered bacteria are also used for the bioremediation industrial toxic wastes the chemical industry bacteria are most important the production enantiomerically pure chemicals for use pharmaceuticals agrichemicals bacteria can also used the place pesticides the biological pest control this commonly involves bacillus thuringiensis also called soil dwelling subspecies this bacteria are used lepidopteran specific insecticides under trade names such dipel and because their these pesticides are regarded environmentally friendly with little effect wildlife pollinators and most other beneficial insects because their ability quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can bacteria are the workhorses for the fields molecular biology genetics and biochemistry making mutations bacterial dna and examining the resulting scientists can determine the function enzymes and metabolic pathways then apply this knowledge more complex this aim understanding the biochemistry cell reaches its most complex expression the synthesis huge amounts enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models entire this achievable some studied with models escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and this understanding bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use biotechnology bioengineer bacteria for the production therapeutic such insulin growth factors antibodies history bacteriology microbiology bacterial taxonomy last universal ancestor antonie van leeuwenhoek microbiologist microscope bacteria were first observed the dutch microscopist antonie van leeuwenhoek using lens microscope his own then published his observations series letters the royal society london bacteria were most remarkable microscopic they were just the limit what his simple lenses could make out one the most striking hiatuses the history one else would see them again for over only then were his forgotten observations opposed his famous animalcules spermatozoa taken christian gottfried ehrenberg introduced the word bacterium his bacterium was genus that contained forming shaped opposed bacillus genus forming shaped bacteria defined ehrenberg louis pasteur demonstrated that the growth microorganisms causes the fermentation process and that this growth not due spontaneous generation yeasts and molds commonly associated with are not but rather fungi along with his contemporary robert koch pasteur was early advocate the germ theory disease robert pioneer medical worked cholera anthrax and tuberculosis his research into tuberculosis koch finally proved the germ for which received nobel prize koch postulates set out criteria test organism the cause disease and these postulates are still used though was known the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause many effective antibacterial treatments were paul ehrlich developed the first changing dyes that selectively stained treponema pallidum the spirochaete that causes syphilis into compounds that selectively killed the ehrlich had been awarded nobel prize for his work immunology and pioneered the use stains detect and identify with his work being the basis the gram stain and the ziehl neelsen stain major step
