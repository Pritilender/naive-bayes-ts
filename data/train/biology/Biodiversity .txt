the result billion years evolution the origin life has not been definitely established however some evidence suggests that life may already have been established only few hundred million years after the formation the earth until approximately million years all life consisted archaea bacteria protozoans and similar single celled organisms the history biodiversity during the phanerozoic the last million starts with rapid growth during the cambrian explosion period during which nearly every phylum multicellular organisms first over the next million years invertebrate diversity showed little overall and vertebrate diversity shows overall exponential this dramatic rise diversity was marked massive losses diversity classified mass extinction events significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed the the worst was the triassic million years vertebrates took million years recover from this the fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity history however not all scientists support this since there uncertainty how strongly the fossil record biased the greater availability and preservation recent geologic sections some scientists believe that corrected for sampling modern biodiversity may not much different from biodiversity million years whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective the diversification estimates the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from million million with best estimate somewhere near million the vast majority arthropods diversity appears increase continually the absence natural evolutionary diversification the existence global carrying limiting the amount life that can live the question whether such limit would also cap the number while records life the sea shows logistic pattern life land plants and shows exponential rise one author tetrapods have not yet invaded per cent potentially habitable and could that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity tetrapods would continue increase exponential fashion until most all the available ecospace the other changes through the phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model widely used population biology demography and macrosociology well fossil biodiversity than with exponential and logistic the latter models imply that changes diversity are guided order positive feedback more more and negative feedback arising from resource hyperbolic model implies order positive the hyperbolic pattern the world population growth arises from order positive feedback between the population size and the rate technological the hyperbolic character biodiversity growth can similarly accounted for feedback between diversity and community structure the similarity between the curves biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence part new mass named the holocene extinction event caused primarily the impact humans are having the has been argued that the present rate extinction sufficient eliminate most species the planet earth within years new species are regularly discovered average between new species each most them insects and though are not yet classified estimates are that nearly

traditional average trillion since the stone age species loss has accelerated above the average basal driven human estimates species losses are rate times fast typical the fossil biodiversity also affords many material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic knowledge systems and biodiversity and agriculture agricultural biodiversity amazon rainforest south america agricultural diversity can divided into two intraspecific diversity which includes the genetic variety within single like the potato solanum tuberosum that composed many different forms and types the might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes purple all but all part the same tuberosum the other category agricultural diversity called interspecific diversity and refers the number and types different thinking about this diversity might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like and also peppers lettuce agricultural diversity can also divided whether diversity diversity this functional classification that impose and not intrinsic feature life planned diversity includes the crops which farmer has planted raised crops covers symbionts and among which can contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the uninvited herbivores weed species and among the control associated biodiversity one the great agricultural challenges that farmers monoculture farms the approach generally eradicate associated diversity using suite biologically destructive pesticides mechanized tools and transgenic engineering techniques then rotate crops although some polyculture farmers use the same they also employ integrated pest management strategies well strategies that are more but generally less dependent biotechnology and interspecific crop diversity responsible for offering
