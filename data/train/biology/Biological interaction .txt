biological interaction navigation search biological interactions are the effects organisms community have one the natural world organism exists absolute and thus every organism must interact with the environment and other interactions with its environment are fundamental the survival that organism and the functioning the ecosystem black walnut antagonism mutualism billed oxpecker giraffe ecology biological interactions can involve individuals the same species intraspecific individuals different species interspecific these can further classified either the mechanism the interaction the duration and direction their species may interact once generation pollination live completely within another endosymbiosis effects range from consumption another individual predation herbivory cannibalism mutual benefit mutualism interactions need not individuals may affect each other indirectly through intermediaries such shared resources common contents interactions categorized effect neutralism amensalism competition antagonism ecological facilitation commensalism mutualism interactions classified mechanism symbiosis competition see also references further reading interactions categorized effect neutralism amensalism commensalism competition mutualism terms that explicitly indicate the quality benefit harm terms fitness experienced participants interaction are listed the there are six possible ranging from mutually beneficial through neutral mutually harmful the level benefit harm continuous and not particular interaction may have range from trivially harmful through for important note that these interactions are not always many two species will interact differently under different this particularly true but not limited cases where species have drastically different life neutralism neutralism describes the relationship between two species that interact but not affect each describes interactions where the health one species has absolutely effect whatsoever that the examples true neutralism are virtually impossible when dealing with the complex networks interactions presented ecosystems one cannot assert positively that there absolutely competition between benefit either however the term often used describe situations where interactions are negligible amensalism amensalism interaction where organism inflicts harm another organism without any costs benefits received the clear case amensalism where sheep cattle trample whilst the presence the grass causes negligible detrimental effects the the grass suffers from being amensalism often used describe strongly asymmetrical competitive such has been observed between the spanish ibex and weevils the genus timarcha which feed upon the same type whilst the presence the weevil has almost influence food the presence ibex has enormous detrimental effect weevil they consume significant quantities plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon competition competition competition mutually detrimental interaction between populations but rarely between clades synnecrosis particular case which the interaction mutually detrimental that results death the case some parasitic relationships citation needed rare and necessarily lived condition evolution selects against the term seldom antagonism syrphid fly predation parasitism herbivory batesian mimicry antagonistic interactions one species benefits the expense predation interaction between organisms which one organism captures biomass from often used synonym for carnivory but its widest definition includes all forms one organism eating regardless trophic level herbivory closeness association parasitism and parasitoidism and harm done prey grazing other interactions that cannot classed predation however are still such batesian mimicry where organism bears superficial similarity least one such harmless plant coming mimic poisonous intraguild predation occurs when organism preys upon another different species but the same trophic level coyotes kill and ingest gray foxes southern ecological facilitation ecological facilitation the following two interactions can classed facilitation describes species interactions that benefit least one the participants and cause harm facilitations can categorized which both species which one species benefits and the other much classic ecological theory natural selection niche separation metapopulation dynamics has focused negative interactions such predation and but positive interactions are receiving increasing focus ecological commensalism commensalism commensalism benefits one organism and the other organism neither benefited nor occurs when one organism takes benefits interacting with another organism which the host organism not good example remora living with remoras eat leftover food from the the shark not affected the remoras eat only leftover food the which does not deplete the mutualism mutualism flowering plants mutualism interaction between two more where species derive mutual for example increased carrying capacity similar interactions within species are known operation mutualism may classified terms the closeness the closest being which often confused with one both species involved the interaction may obligate meaning they cannot survive the short long term without the other though mutualism has historically received less attention than other interactions such very important subject examples include cleaner fish pollination and seed dispersal gut flora llerian mimicry and nitrogen fixation fungi interactions classified mechanism symbiosis symbiosis clownfish amphiprion ocellaris ritteri sea anemone heteractis magnifica the term symbiosis greek living together can used describe various degrees close relationship between organisms different sometimes used only for cases where both organisms sometimes used more generally describe all varieties relatively tight even but not some even far use describe can used describe relationships where one organism lives can used describe cases where organisms are related mutual stereotypic either symbiosis much more common the living world and much more important than generally almost every organism has many internal large percentage herbivores have mutualistic gut fauna that help them digest plant which more difficult digest than animal coral reefs are the result mutalisms between coral organisms and various types algae that live inside most land plants and one might the very existence land ecosystems rely mutualisms between the which fix carbon from the and mycorrhyzal fungi that help extracting minerals from the the evolution all eukaryotes animals fungi protists believed have resulted from symbiosis between various sorts endosymbiotic theory competition red deer competition competition can defined interaction between organisms which the fitness one lowered the presence limited supply least one resource such food water and territory used both usually facilitates this type although the competition may also exist over other such females for reproduction case male organisms the same competition one many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure competition among members the same species known intraspecific competition while competition between individuals different species known interspecific competition interspecific competition normally not fierce intraspecific unless case sudden drastic however the most conspicuous competition where for cheetahs and hyenas are often killed lion competition not always direct interaction and can occur both direct and indirect competition between species the same trophic level who have common increases drastically the frequency the common predator the community decreased large the magnitude competition therefore depends many factors the same according the competitive exclusion principle species less suited compete for resources should either adapt die out according evolutionary theory this competition within and between species for resources plays critical role natural selection see also altruism cheating detritivory epibiont food
