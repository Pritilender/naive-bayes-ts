biology vast and eclectic composed many branches and subdisciplines however despite the broad scope there are certain general and unifying concepts within that govern all study and consolidating into coherent biology recognizes the cell the basic unit genes the basic unit heredity and evolution the engine that propels the synthesis and creation new species also understood today that all organisms survive consuming and transforming energy and regulating their internal environment maintain stable and vital subdisciplines biology are defined the scale which organisms are the kinds organisms and

biology derived from the greek word bios life and the suffix logia study the latin form the term first appeared when linnaeus carl von used biologi his bibliotheca botanica was used again work entitled philosophiae naturalis sive tomus continens biologian phytologian generalis michael christoph hanov disciple christian wolff the first german biologie was used translation work theodor georg august roose used the term grundz der lehre van der lebenskraft the karl friedrich burdach used the term more restricted sense the study human beings from physiological and psychological perspective prop deutik zum studien der gesammten heilkunst the term came into its modern usage with the volume treatise biologie oder philosophie der lebenden natur gottfried reinhold treviranus who although modern biology relatively recent sciences related and included within have been studied since ancient natural philosophy was studied early the ancient civilizations mesopotamia egypt the indian subcontinent and china however the origins modern biology and its approach the study nature are most often traced back ancient greece while the formal study medicine dates back hippocrates was aristotle who contributed most extensively the development especially important are his history animals and other works where showed naturalist and later more empirical works that focused biological causation and the diversity aristotle successor the lyceum theophrastus wrote series books botany that survived the most important contribution antiquity the plant even into the middle ages scholars the medieval islamic world who wrote biology included jahiz dinawari who wrote and rhazes who wrote anatomy and physiology medicine was especially well studied islamic scholars working greek philosopher while natural history drew heavily aristotelian especially upholding fixed hierarchy biology began quickly develop and grow with anton van leeuwenhoek dramatic improvement the microscope was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa bacteria infusoria and the diversity microscopic investigations jan swammerdam led new interest entomology and helped develop the basic techniques microscopic dissection and staining advances microscopy also had profound impact biological the early number biologists pointed the central importance the cell then schleiden and schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that the basic unit organisms the cell and that individual cells have all the characteristics life although they opposed the idea that all cells come from the division other thanks the work robert remak and rudolf virchow however the most biologists accepted all three tenets what came known cell theory meanwhile taxonomy and classification became the focus natural carl linnaeus published basic taxonomy for the natural world variations which have been use ever and the introduced scientific names for all his georges louis comte buffon treated species artificial categories and living forms even suggesting the possibility common descent though was opposed buffon key figure the history evolutionary thought his work influenced the evolutionary theories both lamarck and darwin serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works jean baptiste lamarck who was the first present coherent theory posited that evolution was the result environmental stress properties meaning that the more frequently and rigorously organ was the more complex and efficient would thus adapting the animal its lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then passed the who would further develop and perfect however was the british naturalist charles darwin combining the biogeographical approach humboldt the uniformitarian geology lyell malthus writings population and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural who forged more successful evolutionary theory based natural selection similar reasoning and evidence led alfred russel wallace independently reach the same although was the subject controversy which continues this darwin theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became central axiom the rapidly developing science the discovery the physical representation heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics the and early experiments pointed dna the component chromosomes that held the carrying units that had become known genes focus new kinds model organisms such viruses and bacteria along with the discovery the double helical structure dna marked the transition the era molecular genetics from the present biology has been vastly extended the molecular domain the genetic code was cracked har gobind khorana robert holley and marshall warren nirenberg after dna was understood contain codons finally the human genome project was launched with the goal mapping the general human genome this project was essentially completed with further analysis still being the human genome project was the first step globalized effort incorporate accumulated knowledge biology into molecular definition the human body and the bodies other foundations modern biology cell theory cell theory cell theory states that the cell the fundamental unit life and that all living things are composed one more cells the secreted products those cells shells all cells arise from other cells through cell division multicellular organisms every cell the body derives ultimately from single cell fertilized egg the cell also considered the basic unit many pathological the phenomenon energy flow occurs cells processes that are part the function known metabolism finally cells contain hereditary information dna which passed from cell cell during cell evolution natural selection evolution central organizing concept biology that life changes and develops through and that all forms known have common origin the theory evolution postulates that all organisms the earth both living and have descended from common ancestor ancestral gene pool this last universal common ancestor all organisms believed have appeared about billion years ago biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity the genetic code definitive evidence favor the theory universal common descent for all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes origin life introduced into the scientific lexicon jean baptiste lamarck evolution was established charles darwin fifty years later viable scientific model when articulated its driving natural selection alfred russel wallace recognized the discoverer this concept helped research and experiment with the concept evolution now used explain the great variations life found darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes natural selection and artificial selection selective breeding genetic drift was embraced additional mechanism evolutionary development the modern synthesis the the evolutionary history the species which describes the characteristics the various species from which together with its genealogical relationship every other species known its phylogeny widely varied approaches biology generate information about these include the comparisons dna sequences conducted within molecular biology genomics and comparisons fossils other records ancient organisms paleontology biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various including phylogenetics phenetics and cladistics for summary major events the evolution life currently understood see evolutionary timeline punnett square genetics genetics genes are the primary units inheritance all gene unit heredity and corresponds region dna that influences the form function organism specific all from bacteria share the same basic machinery that copies and translates dna into proteins cells transcribe dna gene into rna version the and ribosome then translates the rna into sequence amino acids the translation code from rna codon amino acid the same for most but slightly different for for sequence dna that codes for insulin humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other such dna usually occurs linear chromosomes eukaryotes and circular chromosomes prokaryotes chromosome organized structure consisting dna and histones the set chromosomes cell and any other hereditary information found the mitochondria chloroplasts other locations collectively known its genome genomic dna located the cell nucleus along with small amounts mitochondria and chloroplasts the dna held within irregularly shaped body the cytoplasm called the nucleoid the genetic information genome held within and the complete assemblage this information organism called its genotype homeostasis homeostasis hypothalamus crh pituitary gland acth glucocorticoids cortisol homeostasis the ability open system regulate its internal environment maintain stable conditions means multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled interrelated regulation all living organisms whether unicellular multicellular exhibit maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain system must detect and respond after the detection biological system normally responds through negative feedback this means stabilizing conditions either reducing increasing the activity organ one example the release glucagon when sugar levels are too energy and human life energy the survival living organism depends the continuous input energy chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned extract energy from substances that act its food and transform them help form new cells and sustain this molecules chemical substances that constitute food play two first they contain energy that can transformed for biological chemical reactions second they develop new molecular structures made the organisms responsible for the introduction energy into ecosystem are known producers autotrophs nearly all these organisms originally draw energy from the plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via process known photosynthesis convert raw materials into organic such atp whose bonds can broken release few ecosystems however depend entirely energy extracted chemotrophs from methane sulfides other luminal energy some the captured energy used produce biomass sustain life and provide energy for growth and the majority the rest this energy lost heat and waste the most important processes for converting the energy trapped chemical substances into energy useful sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration study and research structural molecular biology cell biology genetics developmental biology cell organelles molecular biology the study biology molecular this field overlaps with other areas particularly with genetics and biochemistry molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems including the interrelationship rna and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties cells including their behaviors interactions and environment this done both the microscopic and molecular levels for unicellular organisms such bacteria well the specialized cells multicellular organisms such humans understanding the structure and function cells fundamental all the biological the similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant molecular anatomy considers the forms macroscopic structures such organs and organ genetics the science genes heredity and the variation organisms genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing which turn play central role influencing the final phenotype the modern genetics provides important tools the investigation the function particular the analysis genetic interactions within genetic information generally carried chromosomes where represented the chemical structure particular dna molecules developmental biology studies the process which organisms grow and originating embryology modern developmental biology studies the genetic control cell growth differentiation and morphogenesis which the process that progressively gives rise tissues organs and anatomy model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm caenorhabditis elegans the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster the zebrafish danio rerio the mouse mus musculus and the weed arabidopsis thaliana model organism species that extensively studied understand particular biological phenomena with the expectation that discoveries made that organism provide insight into the workings other physiological physiology physiology studies the physical and biochemical processes living organisms attempting understand how all the structures function the theme structure central physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology but some principles physiology are matter what particular organism being for what learned about the physiology yeast cells can also apply human the field animal physiology extends the tools and methods human physiology human plant physiology borrows techniques from both research physiology studies how for example nervous immune endocrine respiratory and circulatory systems function and the study these systems shared with medically oriented disciplines such neurology and immunology evolutionary evolutionary research concerned with the origin and descent species well their change over and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented for generally involves scientists who have special training particular organisms such mammalogy ornithology botany herpetology but use those organisms systems answer general questions about evolutionary biology partly based paleontology which uses the fossil record answer questions about the mode and tempo and partly the developments areas such population genetics the developmental biology entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study evolutionary developmental biology related fields often considered part evolutionary biology are phylogenetics systematics and taxonomy systematic phylogenetic tree rrna gene bacteria archaea eukaryotes carl woese biological classification domains kingdoms systematics multiple speciation events create tree structured system relationships between the role systematics study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups however systematics was active field research long before evolutionary thinking was traditionally living things have been divided into five monera protista fungi plantae animalia however many scientists now consider this kingdom system modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three domain system archaea originally bacteria originally and eukaryota including protists fungi plants and animals these domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei well differences the chemical composition key biomolecules such ribosomes further each kingdom broken down recursively until each species separately the order domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species outside these there are obligate intracellular parasites that are the edge terms metabolic activity meaning that many scientists not actually classify these structures due their lack least one more the fundamental functions characteristics that define they are classified viruses viroids prions satellites the scientific name organism generated from its genus and for humans are listed homo sapiens homo the and sapiens the when writing the scientific name proper capitalize the first letter the genus and put all the species additionally the entire term may italicized the dominant classification system called the linnaean taxonomy includes ranks and binomial nomenclature how organisms are named governed international agreements such the international code botanical nomenclature the international code zoological nomenclature and the international code nomenclature bacteria the classification viruses viroids prions and all other viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics conducted the international committee taxonomy viruses and known the international code viral classification and nomenclature however several other viral classification systems merging biocode was published attempt standardize nomenclature these three but has yet formally the biocode
