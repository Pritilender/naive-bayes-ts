torrefaction pyrolysis and gasification are separated principally the extent which the chemical reactions involved are allowed proceed mainly controlled the availability oxygen and conversion energy created burning biomass fuel particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more tropical there are number other less more experimental proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such hydrothermal upgrading and hydroprocessing some have been developed for use high moisture content including aqueous and allow them converted into more convenient some the applications thermal conversion are combined heat and power and firing typical dedicated biomass power efficiencies range from hhv biomass cofiring with typically occurs efficiencies near those the coal combustor hhv chemical conversion range chemical processes may used convert biomass into other such produce fuel that more conveniently transported exploit some property the process many these processes are based large part similar based such fischer tropsch synthesis methanol olefins ethylene and and similar chemical fuel most the first step involves which step generally the most expensive and involves the greatest technical biomass more difficult feed into pressure vessel than coal any therefore biomass gasification frequently done atmospheric pressure and causes combustion biomass produce combustible gas consisting carbon monoxide hydrogen and traces methane this gas called producer can provide fuel for various vital such internal combustion engines well substitute for furnace oil direct heat because any biomass material can undergo this process far more attractive than ethanol biomass where only particular biomass materials can used produce biomass gasification desirable process due the ease which can convert solid waste such wastes available into producer which very usable conversion biomass biofuel can also achieved via selective conversion individual components for example cellulose can converted intermediate platform chemical such sorbitol glucose hydroxymethylfurfural etc these chemical are then further reacted produce hydrogen hydrocarbon biomass also has the potential converted multiple commodity halomethanes have successfully been produced using combination fermentans and engineered cerevisiae this method converts nax salts and unprocessed biomass such switchgrass sugar cane corn poplar into adenosylmethionine which naturally occurring cerevisiae allows methyl group production levels iodomethane were these levels roughly capacity would need operated

largest contributor global swedish study the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas south asia determined that had been principally produced biomass and lesser extent fuel researchers measured significant concentration which associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil biomass power plant size often driven biomass availability close proximity transport costs the fuel play key factor the has however that rail and especially shipping waterways can reduce transport costs which has led global biomass make small plants economically profitable those power plants have need equipped with technology that able convert biomass useful electricity with high efficiency such orc cycle similar the water steam power process just with organic working such small power plants can found the carbon from biomass released into the atmosphere carbon dioxide the amount carbon stored dry wood approximately however according the food and agriculture organization the united nations plant matter used fuel can replaced planting for new when the biomass from the time recapture the carbon stored generally and the carbon storage capacity the forest may reduced overall destructive forestry techniques are industry professionals claim that range issues can affect ability comply with emissions some these unique biomass include inconsistent fuel supplies and the type and amount the

were not built comply with stringent many are based technologies developed during the term president jimmy carter who created the united states department energy the energy information administration projected that biomass expected about twice expensive natural slightly more expensive than nuclear and much less expensive than solar another eia study concerning the plan implement renewable energy standard the agency assumed that million tons biomass would accounting for the renewable energy the the adoption based energy plants has been slow but steady between the years and the production these plants has increased the united alternative production sources the whole generate about this biomass contributes approximately the alternative according study conducted early the operating biomass plants the united have been cited federal state regulators for the violation clean air water standards laws over the past years this data also includes minor despite biomass crops may sequester carbon for soil organic carbon has been observed greater switchgrass stands than cultivated cropland especially depths below the grass sequesters the carbon its increased root typically perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due much greater harvested living both living and built over and much less soil disruption the proposal that biomass neutral put forward the early has been superseded more recent science that recognizes that intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than over when carbon released into the atmosphere single contributes climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over current studies indicate that even after years the forest has not recovered its initial carbon and the optimal strategy likely protection the standing not citation given the pros and cons biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may quantified with the iluc factor there controversy surrounding the usage the iluc factor forest based biomass has recently come under fire from number environmental including greenpeace and the natural resources defense council for the harmful impacts can have forests and the greenpeace recently released report entitled fuelling which outlines their concerns around based because any part the tree can the harvesting trees for energy production encourages whole tree harvesting which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular and can harmful the term health the some forest biomass removal increasingly involving elements essential functioning forest including standing naturally disturbed forests and remains traditional logging operations that were previously left the environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that can take many decades for the carbon released burning biomass recaptured regrowing and even longer low productivity furthermore logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them release stored citation needed light the pressing need
