november molecular cell biology formerly cytology from the greek kytos contain scientific discipline that studies cells their physiological properties their the organelles they interactions with their their life cycle division and death this done both microscopic and molecular level cell biology research encompasses both the great diversity celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa well the many specialized cells multicellular organisms such humans plants and sponges knowing the components cells and how cells work fundamental all biological sciences appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types particularly important the fields cell and molecular biology well biomedical fields such cancer research and developmental biology these fundamental similarities and differences provide unifying sometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type extrapolated and generalized other cell therefore research cell biology closely related genetics biochemistry molecular biology immunology and developmental biology contents processes movement proteins other cellular processes internal cellular structures techniques used study cells notable cell biologists see also notes external links processes this section adding march movement proteins each type protein usually sent particular part the important part cell biology the investigation molecular mechanisms which proteins are moved different places inside cells secreted from most proteins are synthesized ribosomes the rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes contain the nucleic acid rna which assembles and joins amino acids make they can found alone groups within the cytoplasm well the this process known protein biosynthesis biosynthesis also called catalyzed process cells living organisms which substrates are converted more complex products also simply known protein translation some such those incorporated membranes known membrane proteins are transported into the rer during this process can followed transportation and processing the golgi apparatus the golgi apparatus large organelle that processes proteins and prepares them for use both inside and outside the the golgi apparatus somewhat like post receives items proteins from the packages and labels and then sends them their destinations different parts the cell the cell membrane for transport out the from the membrane proteins can move the plasma membrane other cellular they can secreted from the the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi can thought the membrane protein synthesis and the membrane protein processing respectively there constant flux proteins through these and resident proteins associate with other proteins but remain their respective other proteins flow through the and golgi the plasma motor proteins transport membrane containing vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks distant parts cells such the axon terminals neurons some proteins that are made the cytoplasm contain structural features that target them for transport into mitochondria the cell nucleus some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for mitochondrial dna chloroplasts also make some cell extracellular and cell surface proteins destined degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into endocytosed vesicles some which fuse with lysosomes where the proteins are broken down their individual amino the degradation some membrane proteins begins while still the cell surface when they are separated secretases proteins that function the cytoplasm are often degraded proteasomes other cellular processes active transport and passive transport movement molecules into and out autophagy the process whereby cells eat their own internal components microbial adhesion holding together cells and division which cells reproduce either either mitosis produce clones the parent meiosis produce haploid gametes cell movement chemotaxis contraction cilia and flagella cell signaling regulation cell behavior signals from dna repair cell death and cell senescence metabolism glycolysis respiration photosynthesis and chemosynthesis transcription and mrna splicing gene internal cellular structures chloroplast key organelle for photosynthesis only found plant cell wall extra layer protection only found plant cell membrane the part the cell which separates the cells from the outside environment and protects the well regulating what goes and out the cell cilium motile structure eukaryotes having the axoneme cytoplasm contents the main filled space inside any chemical reactions also happen cytoskeleton protein filaments inside cells endoplasmic reticulum major site membrane protein synthesis flagellum motile structure bacteria archaea and eukaryotes golgi apparatus site protein glycosylation the endomembrane system lipid bilayer fundamental organizational structure cell membranes lysosome break down cellular waste products and debris into simple compounds only found animal membrane lipid and protein barrier mitochondrion major producing organelle releasing the form atp nucleus holds most the dna eukaryotic cells and controls all cellular activities organelle term used for major subcellular structures ribosome rna and protein complex required for protein synthesis cells vesicle small bounded spheres inside cells techniques used study cells cells may observed under the microscope using several different these include optical microscopy transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy there are several different methods used the study cell culture the basic technique growing cells laboratory independent immunostaining also known immunohistochemistry specialized histological method used localize proteins cells tissue unlike regular which uses stains identify cellular components protein immunostaining requires the reaction antibody directed against the protein interest within the tissue through the use proper controls and published protocols need add reference links specificity the antigen reaction can once this complex identified via either tag attached directly the added additional technical commonly used tags include fluorophores the case the detection the location the protein occurs via fluorescence microscopy with enzymatic such horse radish chemical reaction carried out that results dark color the location the protein this darkened pattern then detected using light microscopy computational genomics used find patterns genomic information dna microarrays identify changes transcript levels between different experimental gene knockdown mutates selected situ hybridization shows which cells are expressing particular rna pcr can used determine how many copies gene are present transfection introduces new gene into usually expression construct purification cells and their parts purification may performed using the following cell fractionation release cellular organelles disruption separation different organelles centrifugation flow cytometry immunoprecipitation proteins extracted from cell membranes detergents and salts
