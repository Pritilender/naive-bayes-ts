the genes within these chromosomes are the nuclear genome the function the nucleus maintain the integrity these genes and control the activities the cell regulating gene expression the nucleus therefore the control center the the main structures making the nucleus are the nuclear envelope double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm and the nucleoskeleton which includes nuclear lamina network within the nucleus that adds mechanical much like the cytoskeleton which supports the cell because the nuclear membrane impermeable large nuclear pores are required that regulate nuclear transport molecules across the the pores cross both nuclear providing channel through which larger molecules must actively transported carrier proteins while allowing free movement small molecules and ions movement large molecules such proteins and rna through the pores required for both gene expression and the

microscopist antonie van leeuwenhoek observed lumen the the red blood cells salmon unlike mammalian red blood those other vertebrates still possess the nucleus was also described franz bauer and more detail scottish botanist robert brown talk the linnean society london brown was studying orchids under microscope when observed opaque which called the areola the cells the outer did not suggest potential matthias schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays role generating thus introduced the name cytoblast cell believed that had observed new cells assembling around cytoblasts franz meyen was strong opponent this having already described cells multiplying division and believing that many cells would have the idea that cells can generated the cytoblast contradicted work robert remak and rudolf virchow who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely cells omnis cellula the function the nucleus remained between and oscar hertwig published several studies the fertilization sea urchin eggs showing that the nucleus the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its this was the first time was suggested that individual develops from nucleated this was contradiction ernst haeckel theory that the complete phylogeny species would repeated during embryonic including generation the first nucleated cell from monerula structureless mass primordial mucus urschleim therefore the necessity the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some however hertwig confirmed his observation other animal amphibians and molluscs eduard strasburger produced the same results for plants this paved the way assign the nucleus important role august weismann postulated the equivalence the maternal and paternal germ cells for the function the nucleus carrier genetic information became clear only after mitosis was discovered and the mendelian rules were rediscovered the beginning the the chromosome theory heredity was therefore structures the nucleus the largest cellular organelle mammalian cells the average diameter the nucleus approximately micrometers which occupies about the total cell the viscous liquid within called nucleoplasm and similar composition the cytosol found outside the appears roughly spherical nuclear envelope and pores nuclear envelope nuclear pores ribosome double membranes dna chromatin nucleolus nucleoplasm nuclear pore nuclear envelope the nuclear envelope otherwise known nuclear consists two cellular membranes inner and outer arranged parallel one another and separated nanometers the nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the genetic material from the surrounding serving barrier prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the the outer nuclear membrane continuous with the membrane the rough endoplasmic reticulum and similarly studded with ribosomes the space between the membranes called the perinuclear space and continuous with the rer lumen nuclear pores which provide aqueous channels through the are composed multiple collectively referred the pores are about million daltons molecular weight and consist around yeast several hundred proteins vertebrates the pores are total however the gap through which molecules freely diffuse only about due the presence regulatory systems within the center the this size selectively allows the passage small soluble molecules while preventing larger such nucleic acids and larger from inappropriately entering exiting the these large molecules must actively transported into the nucleus the nucleus typical mammalian cell will have about pores throughout its each which contains symmetric shaped structure position where the inner and outer membranes attached the ring structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the and series filamentous extensions that reach into the both structures serve mediate binding nuclear transport most ribosomal and some dnas are transported through the pore complexes process mediated family transport factors known karyopherins those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called whereas those that mediate movement out the nucleus are called most karyopherins interact directly with their although some use adaptor proteins steroid hormones such cortisol and aldosterone well other small soluble molecules involved intercellular signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the there they serve transcription factors when bound their ligand the absence many such receptors function histone deacetylases that repress gene nuclear lamina nuclear lamina animal two networks intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical the nuclear lamina forms organized meshwork the internal face the while less organized support provided the cytosolic face the both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear the nuclear lamina composed mostly lamin proteins like all lamins are synthesized the cytoplasm and later transported the nucleus where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network nuclear lamins found the cytosolic face the such emerin and nesprin bind the cytoskeleton provide structural lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular known the nucleoplasmic veil that visible using fluorescence microscopy the actual function the veil not although excluded from the nucleolus and present during interphase lamin structures that make the such lem bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription coding like the components other intermediate filaments the lamin monomer contains alpha helical domain used two monomers coil around each forming dimer structure called coiled coil two these dimer structures then join side antiparallel arrangement form tetramer called protofilament eight these protofilaments form lateral arrangement that twisted form ropelike filament these filaments can assembled disassembled dynamic meaning that changes the length the filament depend the competing rates filament addition and mutations lamin genes leading defects filament assembly are known laminopathies the most notable laminopathy the family diseases known progeria which causes the appearance premature aging its the exact mechanism which the associated biochemical changes give rise the aged phenotype not well chromosomes chromosome fibroblast dna fluorescent situ hybridization the cell nucleus contains the majority the genetic material the form multiple linear dna molecules organized into structures called chromosomes each human cell contains roughly two meters during most the cell cycle these are organized protein complex known chromatin and during cell division the chromatin can seen form the defined chromosomes familiar from karyotype small fraction the genes are located instead the mitochondria there are two types euchromatin the less compact dna and contains genes that are frequently expressed the the other heterochromatin the more compact and contains dna that infrequently this structure further categorized into facultative heterochromatin consisting genes that are organized heterochromatin only certain cell types certain stages and constitutive heterochromatin that consists chromosome structural components such telomeres and centromeres during interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual called chromosome territories active which are generally found the euchromatic region the tend located towards the territory antibodies certain types chromatin nucleosomes have been associated with number autoimmune diseases such systemic lupus erythematosus these are known anti nuclear antibodies and have also been observed concert with multiple sclerosis part general immune system the case progeria the role played the antibodies inducing the symptoms autoimmune diseases not nucleolus nucleolus electron micrograph nucleolus the nucleolus discrete densely stained structure found the not surrounded and sometimes called suborganelle forms around tandem repeats dna coding for ribosomal rna these regions are called nucleolar organizer regions the main roles the nucleolus are synthesize rrna and assemble the structural cohesion the nucleolus depends its ribosomal assembly the nucleolus results the transient association nucleolar facilitating further ribosomal and hence further this model supported observations that inactivation rdna results intermingling nucleolar the first step ribosome protein called rna polymerase transcribes which forms large rrna this cleaved into the subunits and the post transcriptional and assembly rrna occurs the aided small nucleolar rna molecules some which are derived from spliced introns from messenger rnas encoding genes related ribosomal the assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear when observed under the electron microscope the nucleolus can seen consist three distinguishable the innermost fibrillar centers surrounded the dense fibrillar component which turn bordered the granular component transcription the rdna occurs either the the dfc and therefore when rdna transcription the cell more fcs are most the cleavage and modification rrnas occurs the while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur the other subnuclear bodies subnuclear structure sizes structure name structure diameter besides the the nucleus contains number other delineated these include cajal bodies gemini coiled polymorphic interphase karyosomal association promyelocytic leukaemia bodies paraspeckles and splicing although little known about number these they are significant that they show that the nucleoplasm not uniform but rather contains organized functional other subnuclear structures appear part abnormal disease for the presence small intranuclear rods has been reported some cases nemaline myopathy this condition typically results from mutations actin and the rods themselves consist mutant actin well other cytoskeletal cajal bodies and gems nucleus typically contains between and compact structures called cajal bodies coiled bodies whose diameter measures between and depending the cell type and when seen under electron microscope they resemble balls tangled thread and are dense foci distribution for the protein coilin cbs are involved number different roles relating rna specifically small nucleolar rna and small nuclear rna maturation and histone mrna similar cajal bodies are gemini coiled whose name derived from the gemini constellation reference their close twin relationship with gems are similar size and shape and fact are virtually indistinguishable under the unlike gems not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins but contain protein called survivor motor neurons whose function relates snrnp gems are believed assist cbs snrnp though has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that cbs and gems are different manifestations the same rafa and ptf domains rafa polymorphic interphase karyosomal were first described microscopy studies their function was and remains though they were not thought associated with active dna transcription rna they have been found often associate with discrete domains defined dense localization the transcription factor ptf which promotes transcription snrna pml bodies promyelocytic leukaemia bodies pml are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the measuring around they are known number other including nuclear domain kremer and pml oncogenic pml bodies are named after one their major the promyelocytic leukemia protein they are often seen the nucleus association with cajal bodies and cleavage pml bodies belong the nuclear matrix defined structure the nucleus proposed anchor and regulate many nuclear including dna transcription epigenetic the pml protein the key organizer these domains that recruits growing number whose only common known feature date their ability yet pml mice which have their pml gene cannot assemble nuclear develop normally and live demonstrating that pml bodies are dispensable for most basic biological splicing speckles speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched messenger rna splicing factors and are located the interchromatin regions the nucleoplasm mammalian the microscope level they appear punctate which vary size and and when examined electron microscopy they are seen clusters interchromatin speckles are dynamic and both their protein and protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear including active transcription studies the structure and behaviour speckles have provided model for understanding the functional compartmentalization the nucleus and the organization the expression splicing snrnps and other splicing proteins necessary for mrna because changing the composition and location these bodies changes according mrna transcription and regulation via phosphorylation specific the splicing speckles are also known nuclear speckles nuclear splicing factor compartments interchromatin granule clusters snurposomes are found the amphibian oocyte nuclei and drosophila melanogaster embryos snurposomes appear alone attached the cajal bodies the electron micrographs the amphibian igcs function storage sites for the splicing paraspeckles paraspeckle discovered fox paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments the interchromatin first documented hela where there are generally per paraspeckles are now known also exist all human primary transformed cell and tissue their name derived from their distribution the the para short for parallel and the speckles refers the splicing speckles which they are always close paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered response changes cellular metabolic they are transcription dependent and the absence rna pol the paraspeckle disappears and all its associated protein components psp cfi and form crescent shaped perinucleolar cap the nucleolus this phenomenon demonstrated during the cell the cell cycle paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all mitosis except for telophase during when the two daughter nuclei are there rna pol transcription the protein components instead form perinucleolar perichromatin fibrils perichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron they are located next the transcriptionally active chromatin and hypothesized the site active pre mrna processing function the nucleus provides site for genetic transcription that segregated from the location translation the allowing levels gene regulation that are not available prokaryotes the main function the cell nucleus control gene expression and mediate the replication dna during the cell cycle cell compartmentalization the nuclear envelope allows the nucleus control its and separate them from the rest the cytoplasm where this important for controlling processes either side the nuclear most cases where cytoplasmic process needs key participant removed the where interacts with transcription factors downregulate the production certain enzymes the this regulatory mechanism occurs the case glycolysis cellular pathway for breaking down glucose produce hexokinase enzyme responsible for the first the step forming glucose phosphate from high concentrations fructose phosphate molecule made later from regulator protein removes hexokinase the where forms transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins reduce the expression genes involved order control which genes are being the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access the dna until they are activated other signaling this prevents even low levels inappropriate gene for the case controlled which are involved most inflammatory responses transcription induced response signal pathway such that initiated the signaling molecule tnf binds cell membrane resulting the recruitment signalling and eventually activating the transcription factor nuclear localisation signal the protein allows transported through the nuclear pore and into the where stimulates the transcription the target the compartmentalization allows the cell prevent translation unspliced eukaryotic mrna contains introns that must removed before being translated produce functional the splicing done inside the nucleus before the mrna can accessed ribosomes for without the ribosomes would translate newly transcribed mrna resulting misformed and nonfunctional gene expression gene expression gene transcription ribosomal rna primary transcripts end end gene expression first involves transcription which dna used template produce the case genes encoding that rna produced from this process messenger rna which then needs translated ribosomes form ribosomes are located outside the mrna produced needs since the nucleus the site also contains variety proteins that either directly mediate transcription are involved regulating the these proteins include helicases which unwind the stranded dna molecule facilitate access rna polymerases which synthesize the growing rna topoisomerases which change the amount supercoiling helping wind and well large variety transcription factors that regulate processing mrna post transcriptional modification newly synthesized mrna molecules are known primary transcripts they must undergo post transcriptional modification the nucleus before being exported the mrna that appears the cytoplasm without these modifications degraded rather than used for protein translation the three main modifications are capping polyadenylation and rna splicing while the pre mrna associated with variety proteins complexes known heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles addition the cap occurs transcriptionally and the first step transcriptional the poly adenine tail only added after transcription rna carried out complex called the spliceosome the process which introns regions dna that not code for are removed from the mrna and the remaining exons connected form single continuous this process normally occurs after capping and polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis complete transcripts with many many including those encoding antibodies can spliced multiple ways produce different mature mrnas that encode different protein sequences this process known alternative splicing and allows production large variety proteins from limited amount dynamics and regulation nuclear transport nuclear transport macromolecules rna proteins actively transported ran gtp the entry and exit large molecules from the nucleus tightly controlled the nuclear pore although small molecules can enter the nucleus without macromolecules such rna and proteins require association karyopherins called importins enter the nucleus and exportins cargo proteins that must translocated from the cytoplasm the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known nuclear localization signals which are bound while those transported from the nucleus the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound the ability importins and exportins transport their cargo regulated gtpases enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate release the key gtpase nuclear transport ran which can bind either gtp gdp guanosine depending whether located the nucleus the whereas importins depend rangtp dissociate from their exportins require rangtp order bind their nuclear import depends the importin binding its cargo the cytoplasm and carrying through the nuclear pore into the inside the rangtp acts separate the cargo from the allowing the importin exit the nucleus and nuclear export the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus process facilitated exits through the nuclear and separates from its cargo the specialized export proteins exist for translocation mature mrna and trna the cytoplasm after transcriptional modification this control mechanism important due these central role protein mis expression protein due incomplete excision exons incorporation amino acids could have negative consequences for the thus incompletely modified rna that reaches the cytoplasm degraded rather than used assembly and disassembly newt lung stained fluorescent dyes metaphase mitotic spindle chromosomes during its nucleus may broken either the process cell division consequence apoptosis the process programmed cell death during these the structural components the the envelope and can systematically most the disassembly the nuclear envelope marks the end the prophase mitosis however this disassembly the nucleus not universal feature mitosis and does not occur all some unicellular eukaryotes yeasts undergo called closed mitosis which the nuclear envelope remains closed the daughter chromosomes migrate opposite poles the which then divides the cells higher however usually undergo open mitosis which characterized breakdown the nuclear the daughter chromosomes then migrate opposite poles the mitotic and new nuclei reassemble around certain point during the cell cycle open the cell divides form two order for this process each the new daughter cells must have full set process requiring replication the chromosomes well segregation the separate this occurs the replicated the sister chromatids attaching microtubules which turn are attached different centrosomes the sister chromatids can then pulled separate locations the many the centrosome located the outside the the microtubules would unable attach the chromatids the presence the nuclear therefore the early stages the cell beginning prophase and until around prometaphase the nuclear membrane likewise during the same the nuclear lamina also process regulated phosphorylation the lamins protein kinases such the cdc protein kinase towards the end the cell the nuclear membrane and around the same the nuclear lamina are reassembled dephosphorylating the however dinoflagellates the nuclear envelope remains the centrosomes are located the and the microtubules come contact with whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope the called closed mitosis with extranuclear many other protists ciliates sporozoans and the centrosomes are and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell apoptosis controlled process which the structural components are resulting death the changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its for the condensation chromatin and the disintegration the nuclear envelope and the destruction the lamin networks controlled specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases which cleave the lamin proteins thus degrade the structural lamin cleavage sometimes used laboratory indicator caspase activity assays for early apoptotic cells that express mutant resistant lamins are deficient nuclear changes related suggesting that lamins play role initiating the events that lead apoptotic degradation the inhibition lamin assembly itself inducer the nuclear envelope acts barrier that prevents both dna and rna viruses from entering the some viruses require access proteins inside the nucleus order replicate dna such herpesvirus replicate and assemble the cell and exit budding through the inner nuclear this process accompanied disassembly the lamina the nuclear face the inner disease related dynamics initially has been suspected that immunoglobulins general and autoantibodies particular not enter the now there body evidence that under pathological conditions lupus erythematosus igg can enter the anucleated and multinucleated cells cells usually have single but there are also cells that have many some other have this can result normal the maturation mammalian red blood cells result faulty cell anucleated cells contain nucleus and therefore incapable dividing produce daughter the known anucleated cell the mammalian red blood erythrocyte which also lacks other organelles such mitochondria and serves primarily transport vessel ferry oxygen from the lungs the erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis the bone marrow where they lose their organelles and the nucleus expelled during the process differentiation from erythroblast reticulocyte which the immediate precursor the mature the presence mutagens may induce the release some immature micronucleated erythrocytes into the anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division which one daughter lacks nucleus and the other has two multinucleated cells contain multiple most acantharean species protozoa and some fungi mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated other examples include the intestinal parasites the genus giardia which have two nuclei per skeletal muscle cells called myocytes and syncytium become multinucleated during the resulting arrangement nuclei near the periphery the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils multinucleated and binucleated cells can also abnormal for cells arising from the fusion monocytes and macrophages known giant multinucleated cells sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated tumor number dinoflagelates are known have two unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages one from the dinoflagelate and the other from symbiotic diatom curiously the mitochondrion and the plastid the diatom remain evolution the major defining characteristic the eukaryotic the evolutionary origin has been the subject much four major hypotheses have been proposed explain the existence the although none have yet earned widespread the first model known the syntrophic proposes that symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the containing eukaryotic organisms the archaea and bacteria domain have cell hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient similar modern methanogenic archaea invaded and lived within bacteria similar modern myxobacteria eventually forming the early this theory analogous the accepted theory for the origin eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts which are thought have developed from similar endosymbiotic relationship between eukaryotes and aerobic the archaeal origin the nucleus supported observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain including histones observations that myxobacteria are can form multicellular and possess kinases and proteins similar support bacterial origin for the eukaryotic second model proposes that eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without endosymbiotic this model based the existence modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane similar proposal states that like the chronocyte evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic the most controversial known viral eukaryogenesis posits that the bound along with other eukaryotic originated from the infection prokaryote the suggestion based similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such linear dna mrna and tight binding proteins analogizing histones viral envelopes one version the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved concert with phagocytosis form early cellular predator another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected poxviruses the basis observed similarity between the dna polymerases modern poxviruses and has been suggested that the unresolved question the evolution sex could related the viral eukaryogenesis more recent the exomembrane hypothesis suggests that the nucleus instead originated from single ancestral cell that evolved second exterior cell the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage internally synthesized cellular components such ribosomal subunits gallery comparison
