chromosome chromosomes navigation search introduction genetics metaphase chromatid phase centromere chromosome structure dna protein and rna found cells single piece coiled dna containing many genes regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences chromosomes also contain bound which serve package the dna and control its chromosomal dna encodes most all genetic some species also contain plasmids other extrachromosomal genetic chromosomes vary widely between different organisms the dna molecule may circular and can composed over nucleotides long typically eukaryotic cells cells with have large linear chromosomes and prokaryotic cells cells without defined have smaller circular although there are many exceptions this cells may contain more than one type for mitochondria most eukaryotes and chloroplasts plants have their own small nuclear chromosomes are packaged proteins into condensed structure called chromatin this allows the very long dna molecules fit into the cell nucleus the structure chromosomes and chromatin varies through the cell cycle chromosomes are even more condensed than chromatin and are essential unit for cellular chromosomes must divided and passed successfully their daughter cells ensure the genetic diversity and survival their progeny chromosomes may exist either duplicated unduplicated chromosomes are single linear whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies called chromatids sister chromatids joined centromere compaction the duplicated chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis results the classic arm structure pictured the the centromere located the middle the chromosome arm structure the centromere located near one the chromosomal recombination plays vital role genetic these structures are manipulated through processes known chromosomal instability and the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe and may unexpectedly evade apoptosis leading the progression cancer practice chromosome rather loosely defined prokaryotes and viruses the term genophore more appropriate when chromatin however large body work uses the term chromosome regardless chromatin dna usually arranged which tightly coiled sometimes accompanied one more circular dna molecules called plasmids these small circular genomes are also found mitochondria and chloroplasts reflecting their bacterial the simplest genophores are found these dna rna molecules are short linear circular genophores that often lack structural citation needed the word chromosome comes from the greek chroma colour and soma body due their property being very strongly stained particular dyes contents history discovery prokaryotes structure sequences dna packaging eukaryotes chromatin interphase chromatin metaphase chromatin and division human chromosomes number chromosomes various organisms eukaryotes prokaryotes karyotype historical note aberrations see also notes and references external links history discovery walter sutton theodor boveri series experiments beginning the theodor boveri gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the vectors heredity his two principles were the continuity chromosomes and the individuality citation needed the second these principles that was citation needed wilhelm roux suggested that each chromosome carries different genetic load boveri was able test and confirm this aided the rediscovery the start the gregor mendel earlier boveri was able point out the connection between the rules inheritance and the behaviour the boveri influenced two generations american edmund beecher wilson walter sutton and theophilus painter were all influenced boveri wilson and painter actually worked with his famous textbook the cell development and heredity wilson linked together the independent work boveri and sutton both around naming the chromosome theory inheritance the boveri sutton chromosome theory the names are sometimes ernst mayr remarks that the theory was hotly contested some famous william bateson wilhelm johannsen richard goldschmidt and morgan all rather dogmatic turn eventually complete proof came from chromosome maps own the number human chromosomes was published theophilus painter inspection through the microscope counted pairs which would mean chromosomes his error was copied others and was not until that the true was determined born joe hin tjio prokaryotes the bacteria and archaea typically have single circular chromosome but many variations most chromosome can range size from only base pairs the endosymbiotic bacterium candidatus carsonella ruddii base pairs the dwelling bacterium sorangium cellulosum spirochaetes the genus borrelia are notable exception this with bacteria such borrelia burgdorferi the cause lyme disease containing single linear some known orphons aren even chromosome structure sequences prokaryotic chromosomes have less based structure than bacteria typically have single point the origin replication from which replication whereas some archaea contain multiple replication the genes prokaryotes are often organized operons and not usually contain introns unlike dna packaging prokaryotes not possess instead their dna organized into structure called the nucleoid the nucleoid distinct structure and occupies defined region the bacterial this structure however dynamic and maintained and remodeled the actions range like which associate with the bacterial archaea the dna chromosomes even more with the dna packaged within structures similar eukaryotic bacterial chromosomes tend tethered the plasma membrane the molecular biology this allows for its isolation from plasmid dna centrifugation lysed bacteria and pelleting the membranes and the attached prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids like eukaryotic generally supercoiled the dna must first released into its relaxed state for access for transcription regulation and replication fig dna nucleosome metaphase eukaryotes eukaryotic chromosome fine structure eukaryotes cells with nuclei such those found yeast and possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained the each chromosome has one centromere with one two arms projecting from the although under most these arms are not visible most eukaryotes have small circular mitochondrial genome and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular linear cytoplasmic chromosomes the nuclear chromosomes eukaryotes the uncondensed dna exists ordered where wrapped around histones structural proteins forming composite material called chromatin chromatin chromatin chromatin the complex dna and protein found the eukaryotic nucleus which packages the structure chromatin varies significantly between different stages the cell cycle according the requirements the interphase chromatin during interphase the period the cell cycle where the cell not two types chromatin can euchromatin which consists dna that being expressed heterochromatin which consists mostly inactive seems serve structural purposes during the chromosomal heterochromatin can further distinguished into two constitutive heterochromatin which never located around the centromere and usually contains repetitive sequences facultative heterochromatin which sometimes metaphase chromatin and division mitosis meiosis metaphase the early stages mitosis meiosis cell the chromatin strands become more and more they cease function accessible genetic material transcription stops and become compact transportable this compact form makes the individual chromosomes and they form the classic four arm pair sister chromatids attached each other the centromere the shorter arms are called arms from the french petit small and the longer arms are called arms follows the latin grande alternatively sometimes said short for queue meaning tail french this the only natural context which individual chromosomes are visible with optical microscope during microtubules grow from centrosomes located opposite ends the cell and also attach the centromere specialized structures called kinetochores one which present each sister chromatid special dna base sequence the region the kinetochores along with special longer lasting attachment this the microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the that each daughter cell inherits one set once the cells have the chromatids are uncoiled and dna can again spite their chromosomes are structurally highly which enables these giant dna structures contained within cell nucleus human chromosomes chromosomes humans can divided into two autosomes and sex chromosomes certain genetic traits are linked sex and are passed through the sex the autosomes contain the rest the genetic hereditary all act the same way during cell human cells have pairs chromosomes pairs autosomes and one pair sex giving total per addition human cells have many hundreds copies the mitochondrial genome sequencing the human genome has provided great deal information about each the below table compiling statistics for the based the sanger institute human genome information the vertebrate genome annotation database number genes estimate part based gene predictions total chromosome length estimate based the estimated size unsequenced heterochromatin regions genes base pairs sex sex number chromosomes various organisms list number chromosomes various organisms eukaryotes these tables give the total number chromosomes including sex cell for human cells are diploid and have different types autosome each present two and two sex chromosomes this gives chromosomes other organisms have more than two copies their such bread wheat which hexaploid and has six copies seven different chromosomes arabidopsis thaliana rye maize einkorn wheat durum wheat bread wheat cultivated tobacco adder tongue fern common fruit fly guinea pig guppy poecilia reticulata garden snail earthworm octodrilus complanatus pill millipede arthrosphaera fumosa tibetan fox domestic cat domestic pig laboratory mouse laboratory rat rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus syrian hamster hares human gorillas chimpanzees domestic sheep elephants cow donkey horse dog kingfisher goldfish silkworm microchromosomes trypanosoma brucei domestic pigeon columba livia domestics chicken normal members particular eukaryotic species all have the same number nuclear chromosomes see the other eukaryotic mitochondrial and like small are much more variable and there may thousands copies per prometaphase fibroblast asexually reproducing species have one set which are the same all body however asexual species can either haploid sexually reproducing species have somatic cells body which are diploid having two sets chromosomes pairs humans with one set chromosomes from each one set from the mother and one from the gametes reproductive are haploid they have one set gametes are produced meiosis diploid germ line cell during the matching chromosomes father and mother can exchange small parts themselves crossover and thus create new chromosomes that are not inherited solely from either when male and female gamete merge fertilization new diploid organism some animal and plant species are polyploid they have more than two sets homologous chromosomes plants important agriculture such tobacco wheat are often compared their ancestral wheat has haploid number seven still seen some cultivars well the wild the common pasta and bread wheats are having and chromosomes compared the chromosomes the wild prokaryotes prokaryote species generally have one copy each major but most cells can easily survive with multiple for buchnera symbiont aphids has multiple copies its ranging from copies per however some large such epulopiscium fishelsoni copies the chromosome can plasmids and like small chromosomes highly variable copy the number plasmids the cell almost entirely determined the rate division the fast division causes high copy karyotype karyotype figure the karyotype the characteristic chromosome complement eukaryote species the preparation and study karyotypes part cytogenetics although the replication and transcription dna highly standardized eukaryotes the same cannot said for their karyotypes which are often highly there may variation between species chromosome number and detailed some there significant variation within often there germ line soma gametes balanced genetic polymorphism geographical variation races mosaics variation karyotype may occur during development from the fertilised the technique determining the karyotype usually called karyotyping cells can locked way through division vitro reaction with colchicine these cells are then photographed and arranged into karyogram with the set chromosomes autosomes order and sex chromosomes here the fig like many sexually reproducing humans have special gonosomes sex contrast autosomes these are females and historical note investigation into the human karyotype took many years settle the most basic how many chromosomes does normal diploid human cell hans von winiwarter reported chromosomes spermatogonia and oogonia concluding sex determination mechanism painter was not certain whether the diploid number man first favouring revised his opinion later from and correctly insisted humans having system new techniques were needed definitively solve the using cells culture arresting mitosis metaphase solution colchicine pretreating cells hypotonic solution which swells them and spreads the chromosomes squashing the preparation the slide forcing the chromosomes into single plane cutting photomicrograph and arranging the result into indisputable took until before the human diploid number was confirmed considering the techniques winiwarter and their results were quite chimpanzees the closest living relatives modern have chromosomes well the other great apes humans two chromosomes fused form chromosome aberrations chromosome abnormality aneuploidy chromosomal aberrations are disruptions the normal chromosomal content cell and are major cause genetic conditions such down syndrome although most aberrations have little some chromosome abnormalities not cause disease such translocations chromosomal inversions although they may lead higher chance bearing child with chromosome abnormal numbers chromosomes chromosome called aneuploidy may lethal may give rise genetic genetic counseling offered for families that may carry chromosome the gain loss dna from chromosomes can lead variety genetic disorders human examples cri chat which caused the deletion part the short arm chromosome cri means cry the the condition was named because affected babies make pitched cries that sound like those affected individuals have set small head and moderate severe mental health and are very down syndrome the most common usually caused extra copy chromosome trisomy characteristics include decreased muscle stockier asymmetrical slanting eyes and mild moderate developmental edwards syndrome the second most common citation needed symptoms include motor developmental disability and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health ninety percent those affected die they have characteristic clenched hands and overlapping isodicentric also called partial tetrasomy inverted duplication inv dup jacobsen syndrome which very also called the terminal deletion those affected have normal intelligence mild developmental with poor expressive language most have bleeding disorder called paris trousseau syndrome klinefelter syndrome men with klinefelter syndrome are usually and tend taller and have longer arms and legs than their boys with the syndrome are often shy and and have higher incidence speech delay and dyslexia without testosterone some may develop gynecomastia during patau syndrome also called syndrome symptoms are somewhat similar those without the characteristic folded small supernumerary marker chromosome this means there abnormal features depend the origin the extra genetic cat eye syndrome and isodicentric chromosome syndrome are both caused supernumerary marker pallister killian syndrome triple syndrome xxx girls tend tall and thin and have higher incidence turner syndrome instead turner female sexual characteristics are present but females with turner syndrome often have short low abnormal eye features and bone development and appearance the xyy syndrome xyy boys are usually taller than their like xxy boys and xxx they are more likely have learning wolf hirschhorn syndrome which caused
