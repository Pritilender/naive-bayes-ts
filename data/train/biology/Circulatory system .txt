permits blood circulate and transport nutrients such amino acids and electrolytes oxygen carbon dioxide hormones and blood cells and from cells the body nourish and help fight stabilize body temperature and and maintain homeostasis the circulatory system often seen composed both the cardiovascular system which distributes and the lymphatic system which circulates these are two separate the passage lymph for example takes lot longer than that blood fluid consisting plasma red blood cells white blood cells and platelets that circulated the heart through the vertebrate vascular system carrying oxygen and nutrients and waste materials away from all body lymph essentially recycled excess blood plasma after has been filtered from the interstitial fluid between and returned the lymphatic the cardiovascular from latin words meaning system comprises the heart and blood vessels the lymph and lymph vessels form the lymphatic which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid between while well other vertebrates have closed cardiovascular system meaning that the blood never leaves the network arteries veins and capillaries some invertebrate groups have open cardiovascular the lymphatic the other open system providing accessory route for excess interstitial fluid get returned the the more diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory contents human

system the essential components the human cardiovascular system are the heart blood and blood vessels the pulmonary circulation loop through the lungs where blood and the systemic circulation loop through the rest the body provide oxygenated blood average adult contains five six quarts roughly liters accounting for approximately their total body blood consists plasma red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also the digestive system works with the circulatory system provide the nutrients the system needs keep the heart pumping closed cardiovascular system the cardiovascular systems humans are meaning that the blood never leaves the network blood vessels oxygen and nutrients diffuse across the blood vessel layers and enter interstitial fluid which carries oxygen and nutrients the target and carbon dioxide and wastes the opposite the other component the circulatory the lymphatic system not heart human heart the heart pumps oxygenated blood the body and deoxygenated blood the the human heart there one atrium and one ventricle for each and with both systemic and pulmonary circulation there are four chambers left atrium left ventricle right atrium and right ventricle the right atrium the upper chamber the right side the the blood that returned the right atrium deoxygenated poor and passed into the right ventricle pumped through the pulmonary artery the lungs for oxygenation and removal carbon the left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs well the pulmonary vein which passed into the strong left ventricle pumped through the aorta the different organs the coronary circulation coronary circulation coronary circulatory system provides blood supply the myocardium the heart arises from the aorta two coronary arteries the left and the and after nourishing the myocardium blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right back flow blood through its opening during atrial systole prevented the thebesian valve the smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart pulmonary circulation pulmonary circulation the pulmonary circulatory system the portion the cardiovascular system which oxygen depleted blood pumped away from the via the pulmonary artery the lungs and oxygenated the heart via the pulmonary vein oxygen deprived blood from the superior and inferior vena cava enters the right atrium the heart and flows through the tricuspid valve right atrioventricular into the right from which then pumped through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery the gas exchange occurs the whereby released from the and oxygen the pulmonary vein returns the now rich blood the left atrium systemic circulation systemic circulation systemic circulation the circulation the blood all parts the body except the systemic circulation the portion the cardiovascular system which transports oxygenated blood away from the heart through the aorta from the left ventricle where the blood has been previously deposited from pulmonary the rest the and returns depleted blood back the systemic circulation distance much longer than pulmonary transporting blood every part the oxygen transportation blood oxygen transport about the oxygen sample arterial blood healthy human breathing air level pressure chemically combined with hemoglobin molecules about physically dissolved the other blood liquids and not connected the hemoglobin molecule the primary transporter oxygen mammals and many other development magnetic resonance angiography aberrant subclavian artery the development the circulatory system initially occurs the process vasculogenesis the human arterial and venous systems develop from different embryonic while the arterial system develops mainly from the aortic arches the venous system arises from three bilateral veins during weeks human development arterial development aortic arches the human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the dorsal aortae starting from week human aortic arch almost completely regresses except form the maxillary arteries aortic arch also completely regresses except form the stapedial arteries the definitive formation the arterial system arise from aortic arches and while aortic arch completely the dorsal aortae are initially bilateral and then fuse form the definitive dorsal approximately posterolateral branches arise off the aorta and will form the intercostal arteries upper and lower extremity lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral the lateral branches the aorta form the definitive renal suprarrenal and gonadal arteries finally the ventral branches the aorta consist the vitelline arteries and umbilical arteries the vitelline arteries form the celiac superior and inferior mesenteric arteries the gastrointestinal after the umbilical arteries will form the internal iliac arteries venous development the human venous system develops mainly from the vitelline veins the umbilical veins and the cardinal veins all which empty into the sinus venosus measurement techniques electrocardiogram for cardiac electrophysiology sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for blood pressure

animals other vertebrates ccff the circulatory systems all vertebrates well annelids for earthworms and cephalopods squids octopuses and are closed just still the systems fish amphibians reptiles and birds show various stages the evolution the circulatory the system has only one with the blood being pumped through the capillaries the gills and the capillaries the body this known single cycle circulation the heart fish therefore only single pump consisting two amphibians and most double circulatory system but the heart not always completely separated into two amphibians have chambered the ventricular septum the heart incomplete and the pulmonary artery equipped with sphincter muscle this allows second possible route blood instead blood flowing through the pulmonary artery the the sphincter may contracted divert this blood flow through the incomplete ventricular septum into the left ventricle and out through the aorta this means the blood flows from the capillaries the heart and back the capillaries instead the this process useful ectothermic animals the regulation their body birds and mammals show complete separation the heart into two for total four heart thought citation needed that the chambered heart birds evolved independently from that open circulatory system the open circulatory system system which fluid cavity called the hemocoel bathes the organs directly with oxygen and nutrients and there distinction between blood and interstitial fluid this combined fluid called hemolymph muscular movements the animal during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph but diverting flow from one area another when the heart relaxes blood drawn back toward the heart through ended pores hemolymph fills all the interior hemocoel the body and surrounds all cells hemolymph composed water inorganic salts mostly and and organic compounds mostly carbohydrates proteins and lipids the primary oxygen transporter molecule hemocyanin there are floating the hemocytes within the they play role the arthropod immune system absence circulatory system helicometra circulatory systems are absent some including flatworms phylum platyhelminthes their body cavity has lining enclosed instead muscular pharynx leads extensively branched digestive system that facilitates direct diffusion nutrients all the ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance any cell from the digestive system the exterior the oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into the and carbon dioxide can diffuse consequently every cell able obtain water and oxygen without the need transport some such jellyfish have more extensive branching from their gastrovascular cavity which functions both place digestion and form this branching allows for bodily fluids reach the outer since the digestion begins the inner history discovery the earliest known writings the circulatory system are found the ebers papyrus century ancient egyptian medical papyrus containing over prescriptions and both physical and the papyrus acknowledges the connection the heart the the egyptians thought air came through the mouth and into the lungs and from the the air travelled every member through the although this concept the circulatory system only partially represents one the earliest accounts scientific the century the knowledge circulation vital fluids through the body was known the ayurvedic physician sushruta ancient india also seems have possessed knowledge the arteries described dwivedi dwivedi the valves the heart were discovered physician the hippocratean school around the century however their function was not properly understood because blood pools the veins after arteries look ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air and that they were for transport the greek physician herophilus distinguished veins from arteries but thought that the pulse was property arteries greek anatomist erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life ascribed the fact the phenomenon that air escaping from artery replaced with blood that entered very small vessels between veins and thus apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow century rome the greek physician galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous dark and arterial brighter and blood each with distinct and separate growth and energy were derived from venous blood created the liver from while arterial blood gave vitality containing pneuma and originated the blood flowed from both creating organs all parts the body where was consumed and there was return blood the heart the heart did not pump blood the motion sucked blood during diastole and the blood moved the pulsation the arteries galen believed that the arterial blood was created venous blood passing from the left ventricle the right passing through the interventricular air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery the left side the the arterial blood was created vapors were created and passed the lungs also via the pulmonary artery the canon medicine the persian physician avicenna erroneously accepted the greek notion regarding the existence hole the ventricular septum which the blood traveled between the despite avicenna correctly wrote the cardiac cycles and valvular and had vision blood his treatise pulse verification needed while also refining erroneous theory the avicenna provided the first correct explanation every beat the pulse comprises two movements and two thus expansion pause contraction pause the pulse movement the heart and arteries which takes the form alternate expansion and the arabian physician ibn nafis became the first person accurately describe the process pulmonary circulation for which sometimes considered the father circulatory physiology not citation given ibn nafis stated his commentary anatomy canon the blood from the right chamber the heart must arrive the left chamber but there direct pathway between the thick septum the heart not perforated and does not have visible pores some people thought invisible pores galen the blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa pulmonary artery the spread through its mingled there with pass through the arteria venosa pulmonary vein reach the left chamber the heart and there form the vital ibn nafis had insight into what would become larger theory the capillary circulation stated that there must small communications pores manafidh between the pulmonary artery and prediction that preceded the discovery the capillary system more than years ibn theory however was confined blood transit the lungs and did not extend the entire michael servetus was the first european describe the function pulmonary although his achievement was not widely recognized the for few firstly described the manuscript near but this work was never and later published this but theological christianismi restitutio not book only three copies the book the rest were burned shortly after its publication because persecution servetus religious better known was its discovery vesalius successor padua realdo colombo william harvey exercitatio anatomica motu cordis sanguinis animalibus william harvey pupil hieronymus fabricius who had earlier described the valves the veins without recognizing their performed sequence and published exercitatio anatomica motu cordis sanguinis animalibus which demonstrated that there had direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the and not just the most argued that the beat the heart produced continuous circulation blood through minute connections the extremities the this conceptual leap that was quite different from ibn refinement the anatomy and bloodflow the heart and this with its essentially correct slowly convinced the medical however harvey was not able identify the capillary system connecting arteries and these were later discovered marcello malpighi andr ric cournand werner forssmann
