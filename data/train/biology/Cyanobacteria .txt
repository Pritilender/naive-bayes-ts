phycochromaceae schizophyceae cyanobacteria also known cyanophyta phylum bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis the name cyanobacteria comes from the color the bacteria greek blue they are often called blue green algae but some consider that name misnomer cyanobacteria are prokaryotic and algae should eukaryotic although other definitions algae encompass prokaryotic producing oxygen gas product cyanobacteria are thought have converted the early reducing atmosphere into oxidizing one which dramatically changed the composition life forms earth stimulating biodiversity and

deserts bare rock and and even antarctic rocks they can occur planktonic cells form phototrophic biofilms they are found almost every endolithic ecosystem few are endosymbionts lichens plants various protists sponges and provide energy for the host some live the fur sloths providing form camouflage aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms that can form both freshwater and marine the blooms can have the appearance green paint these blooms can toxic and frequently lead the closure recreational waters when marine bacteriophages are significant parasites unicellular marine characteristics cyanobacteria are photosynthetic nitrogen fixing group that survive wide variety soil and this group photosynthetic pigments are cyanophycin allo phycocyanine and their thallus varies from unicellular filamentous they fix atmospheric nitrogen aerobic condition heterocyst specialized and anaerobic nitrogen fixation nostoc pruniforme cylindrospermum cyanobacteria include unicellular and colonial species colonies may form filaments sheets even hollow some filamentous colonies show the ability differentiate into several different cell types vegetative the photosynthetic cells that are formed under favorable growing akinetes the resistant spores that may form when environmental conditions become and walled heterocysts which contain the enzyme nitrogenase vital for nitrogen fixation heterocysts may also form under the appropriate environmental conditions when fixed nitrogen heterocyst forming species are specialized for nitrogen fixation and are able fix nitrogen gas into ammonia nitrites nitrates which can absorbed plants and converted protein and nucleic acids atmospheric nitrogen not bioavailable rice plantations utilize healthy populations fixing cyanobacteria anabaena symbiotes the aquatic fern azolla for use rice paddy cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful group microorganisms they are the most genetically they occupy broad range habitats across all widespread marine and terrestrial and they are found the most extreme niches such hot salt and hypersaline photoautotrophic oxygen producing cyanobacteria created the conditions the early atmosphere that directed the evolution aerobic metabolism and eukarotic cyanobacteria fulfill vital ecological functions the being important contributors global carbon and nitrogen ecology many cyanobacteria form motile filaments called hormogonia that travel away from the main biomass bud and form new colonies the cells hormogonium are often thinner than the vegetative and the cells either end the motile chain may order break away from the parent hormogonium often must tear apart weaker cell called each individual cell cyanobacterium typically has gelatinous cell wall they lack flagella but hormogonia some species can move about gliding along many the cellular filamentous forms oscillatoria are capable waving the filament oscillates back and water columns some cyanobacteria float forming gas archaea these vesicles are not organelles they are not bounded lipid membranes but protein some these organisms contribute significantly global ecology and the oxygen cycle the tiny marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus was discovered and accounts for more than half the photosynthesis the open many cyanobacteria even display the circadian rhythms that were once thought exist only eukaryotic cells see bacterial circadian rhythms photosynthesis carbon fixation cyanobacteria use the energy sunlight drive photosynthesis process where the energy light used split water molecules into protons and while most the energy electrons derived from water are used the cyanobacterial cells for their own fraction these electrons are donated the external environment via electrogenic activity cyanobacterial electrogenic activity important microbiological conduit solar energy into the metabolism and organelles with any prokaryotic cyanobacteria not have nuclei internal membrane system however many species cyanobacteria have folds their external membranes that function photosynthesis cyanobacteria get their colour from the bluish pigment phycocyanin which they use capture light for photosynthesis cyanobacteria uses water electron donor and produces oxygen though some may also use hydrogen sulfide process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such the purple sulfur bacteria carbon dioxide reduced form carbohydrates via the calvin cycle most the photosynthetic machinery embedded into folds the cell called thylakoids the large amounts oxygen the atmosphere are considered have been first created the activities ancient they are often found symbionts with number other groups organisms such fungi lichens corals pteridophytes azolla angiosperms gunnera etc many cyanobacteria are able reduce nitrogen and carbon dioxide under aerobic conditions fact that may responsible for their evolutionary and ecological the oxidizing photosynthesis accomplished coupling the activity photosystem and scheme anaerobic they are also able use only cyclic with electron donors other than water hydrogen sulfide thiosulphate even molecular hydrogen just like purple photosynthetic bacteria furthermore they share archaeal property the ability reduce elemental sulfur anaerobic respiration the their photosynthetic electron transport shares the same compartment the components respiratory electron their plasma membrane contains only components the respiratory while the thylakoid membrane hosts interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport citation needed the terminal oxidases the thylakoid membrane photosynthetic electron transport chain are essential for survival rapid light although not for dark maintenance under conditions where cells are not light attached thylakoid phycobilisomes act light harvesting antennae for the the phycobilisome components phycobiliproteins are responsible for the green pigmentation most the variations this theme are due mainly carotenoids and phycoerythrins that give the cells the brownish some the color light influences the composition green the cells accumulate more whereas red light they produce more thus the bacteria appear green red light and red green this process known complementary chromatic adaptation and way for the cells maximize the use available light for few however lack phycobilisomes and have chlorophyll instead prochloron prochlorococcus prochlorothrix these were originally grouped together the prochlorophytes but appear have developed several different lines for this reason they are now considered part the cyanobacterial citation needed relationship chloroplasts gloeobacter prochlorococcus synechococcus plastids all other cyanobacteria chloroplasts found eukaryotes algae and likely evolved from endosymbiotic relation with this endosymbiotic theory supported various structural and genetic similarities primary chloroplasts are found among the true plants green plants species ranging from sea lettuce evergreens and flowers that contain chlorophyll well among the red algae and glaucophytes marine species that contain now appears that these chloroplasts probably had single ancestor the clade called archaeplastida other algae likely took their chloroplasts from these forms secondary endosymbiosis earth history stromatolite classification generelle morphologie der organismen nostoc monera bacterial taxonomy bacteria were first classified plants constituting the class schizomycetes which along with the schizophyceae blue green cyanobacteria formed the phylum schizophyta then the phylum monera the kingdom protista haeckel comprising protogens protamaeba vampyrella protomonae and vibrio but not nostoc and other which were classified with algae later reclassified the prokaryotes chatton the cyanobacteria were traditionally classified morphology into five referred the numerals the first three chroococcales pleurocapsales and oscillatoriales are not supported phylogenetic however the latter two nostocales and stigonematales are and make the heterocystous the members chroococales are unicellular and usually aggregate the classic taxonomic criterion has been the cell morphology and the plane cell the cells have the ability form internal spores the rest the sections include filamentous the cells are uniseriately arranged and not form specialized cells akinetes and nostocales and stigonematales the cells have the ability develop heterocysts certain stigonematales unlike includes species with truly branched most taxa included the phylum division cyanobacteria have not yet been validly published under the bacteriological code except the classes chroobacteria hormogoneae and gloeobacteria the orders chroococcales gloeobacterales nostocales oscillatoriales pleurocapsales and stigonematales the families prochloraceae and prochlorotrichaceae the genera halospirulina planktothricoides prochlorococcus prochloron prochlorothrix biotechnology and applications the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc was the third prokaryote and first photosynthetic organism whose genome was completely sequenced continues important model the smallest genomes have been found prochlorococcus spp and the largest nostoc punctiforme those calothrix spp are estimated large yeast recent research has suggested the potential application cyanobacteria the generation renewable energy via converting sunlight into internal photosynthetic pathways can coupled chemical mediators that transfer electrons external currently efforts are underway commercialize algae based fuels such diesel gasoline and jet fuel researchers from company called algenol have cultured genetically modified cyanobacteria sea water inside clear plastic enclosure that they first make sugar from and the water via then the bacteria secrete ethanol from the cell into the salt the day and the solar radiation ethanol concentrations build and the ethanol itself evaporates onto the roof the the sun evaporated ethanol and water condenses into which run along the plastic walls and into ethanol from where extracted from the enclosure with the water and ethanol separated outside the march algenol was claiming have tested its technology florida and have achieved yields gallons per acre per this could potentially meet demands for ethanol gasoline assuming blend from area around half the size san bernardino requiring less than one tenth the area than ethanol from other such and only very limited amounts fresh cyanobacteria may possess the ability produce substances that could one day serve inflammatory agents and combat bacterial infections spirulina extracted blue color used natural food coloring gum and health risks some cyanobacteria produce toxins called cyanotoxins these include anatoxin anatoxin aplysiatoxin cylindrospermopsin domoic acid microcystin nodularin from nodularia neosaxitoxin and saxitoxin cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain this results algal blooms which can become harmful other species the cyanobacteria involved produce these toxins can neurotoxins hepatotoxins cytotoxins and endotoxins and can toxic and dangerous humans well other animals and marine life several cases human poisoning have been documented but lack knowledge prevents accurate assessment the recent studies suggest that significant exposure high levels some species cyanobacteria producing toxins such bmaa can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known lou the lake mascoma als cluster and gulf war cluster are two notable dietary supplementation some cyanobacteria are sold notably aphanizomenon aquae and arthrospira platensis spirulina spirulina microalgae contain substances high biological such polyunsaturated fatty amino acids pigments antioxidants vitamins and edible green algae reduce the production inflammatory cytokines inhibiting pathway macrophages and consumption edible blue green algae may also reduce risks cataracts and age related macular degeneration has also shown mitigative effects animal models alcohol related liver such steatohepatitis and parkinson disease sulfate polysaccharides exhibit antitumor antithrombotic anticoagulant anti anti antimicrobial and even antiviral activity against herpes and they also improve insulin resistance they also protect against aflatoxin and cisplatin chemotherapy induced liver these positive health benefits must distinguished from edible species which
