biology	dna navigation search introduction genetics dna double helix atoms element double helix deoxyribonucleic acid dna molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used the development and functioning all known living organisms and many viruses dna nucleic acid alongside proteins and carbohydrates nucleic acids compose the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms life most dna molecules consist two biopolymer strands coiled around each other form double helix the two dna strands are known polynucleotides since they are composed simpler units called nucleotides each nucleotide composed nitrogen containing nucleobase either guanine adenine thymine cytosine well monosaccharide sugar called deoxyribose and phosphate group the nucleotides are joined one another chain covalent bonds between the sugar one nucleotide and the phosphate the resulting alternating sugar phosphate backbone according base pairing rules with and with hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases the two separate polynucleotide strands make stranded dna suited for biological information storage the dna backbone resistant and both strands the stranded structure store the same biological biological information replicated the two strands are significant portion dna more than for non coding meaning that these sections not serve function encoding the two strands dna run opposite directions each other and are therefore anti parallel attached each sugar one four types nucleobases bases the sequence these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological under the genetic code rna strands are translated specify the sequence amino acids within these rna strands are initially created using dna strands template process called transcription within dna organized into long structures called chromosomes during cell division these chromosomes are duplicated the process dna replication providing each cell its own complete set eukaryotic organisms animals plants fungi and protists store most their dna inside the cell nucleus and some their dna organelles such mitochondria chloroplasts prokaryotes bacteria and archaea store their dna only the cytoplasm within the chromatin proteins such histones compact and organize these compact structures guide the interactions between dna and other helping control which parts the dna are scientists use dna molecular tool explore physical laws and such the ergodic theorem and the theory elasticity the unique material properties dna have made attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested and among notable advances this field are dna origami and based hybrid the obsolete synonym desoxyribonucleic acid may occasionally for genetics contents properties nucleobase classification grooves base

history dna research see also references further reading external links properties hydrogen bonds dna long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides dna was first identified and isolated friedrich miescher and the double helix structure dna was first discovered james watson and francis crick the structure dna all species comprises two helical chains each coiled round the same and each with pitch nanometres and radius nanometres according another when measured particular the dna chain measured wide nanometres and one nucleotide unit measured long although each individual repeating unit very dna polymers can very large molecules containing millions for the largest human chromosome chromosome number consists approximately million base pairs and living organisms dna does not usually exist single but instead pair molecules that are held tightly these two long strands entwine like the shape double helix the nucleotide repeats contain both the segment the backbone the which holds the chain and which interacts with the other dna strand the nucleobase linked sugar called nucleoside and base linked sugar and one more phosphate groups called nucleotide polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides called polynucleotide the backbone the dna strand made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues the sugar dna deoxyribose which pentose carbon sugar the sugars are joined together phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms adjacent sugar these asymmetric bonds mean strand dna has double helix the direction the nucleotides one strand opposite their direction the other the strands are antiparallel the asymmetric ends dna strands are called the five prime and three prime ends with the end having terminal phosphate group and the end terminal hydroxyl one major difference between dna and rna the with the deoxyribose dna being replaced the alternative pentose sugar ribose animated version the dna double helix stabilized primarily two hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases the aqueous environment the the conjugated bonds nucleotide bases align perpendicular the axis the dna minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell and the gibbs free energy the four bases found dna are adenine abbreviated cytosine guanine and thymine these four bases are attached the phosphate form the complete shown for adenosine monophosphate nucleobase classification the nucleobases are classified into two the purines and being fused and membered heterocyclic compounds and the pyrimidines the membered rings and fifth pyrimidine uracil usually takes the place thymine rna and differs from thymine lacking methyl group its addition rna and dna large number artificial nucleic acid analogues have also been created study the properties nucleic for use uracil not usually found occurring only breakdown product however number bacillus subtilis bacteriophages and and yersinia bacteriophage thymine has been replaced another phage staphylococcal phage has been identified with genome where thymine has been replaced base modified form also found number the flagellates diplonema and euglena and all the kinetoplastid genera biosynthesis occurs two the first step specific thymidine dna converted into the second homedu glycosylated form proteins that bind specifically this base have been these proteins appear distant relatives the oncogene that involved the pathogenesis acute myeloid leukemia appears act termination signal for rna polymerase hoechst grooves twin helical strands form the dna another double helix may found tracing the between the these voids are adjacent the base pairs and may provide binding site the strands are not symmetrically located with respect each the grooves are unequally one the major wide and the the minor wide the narrowness the minor groove means that the edges the bases are more accessible the major proteins like transcription factors that can bind specific sequences stranded dna usually make contacts the sides the bases exposed the major this situation varies unusual conformations dna within the cell see but the major and minor grooves are always named reflect the differences size that would seen the dna twisted back into the ordinary base pairing base pair dna double each type nucleobase one strand bonds with just one type nucleobase the other this called complementary base pairing here purines form hydrogen bonds with adenine bonding only thymine two hydrogen and cytosine bonding only guanine three hydrogen this arrangement two nucleotides binding together across the double helix called base hydrogen bonds are not covalent they can broken and rejoined relatively the two strands dna double helix can therefore pulled apart like either mechanical force high temperature result this all the information the stranded sequence dna helix duplicated each which vital dna indeed this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs critical for all the functions dna living hydrogen bonds the two types base pairs form different numbers hydrogen forming two hydrogen and forming three hydrogen bonds see right dna with high content more stable than dna with low noted most dna molecules are actually two polymer bound together helical fashion noncovalent this double stranded structure dsdna maintained largely the intrastrand base stacking which are strongest for the two strands can come process known form two stranded dna molecules ssdna molecules melting occurs high low salt and high low also melts but since dna unstable due acid low rarely the stability the dsdna form depends not only the content but also sequence since stacking sequence and also length longer molecules are more the stability can measured various common way the melting which the temperature which the molecules are converted melting temperature dependent ionic strength and the concentration both the percentage base pairs and the overall length dna double helix that determines the strength the association between the two strands long dna helices with high content have interacting while short helices with high content have interacting parts the dna double helix that need separate such the tataat pribnow box some promoters tend have high making the strands easier pull the the strength this interaction can measured finding the temperature necessary break the hydrogen their melting temperature also called value when all the base pairs dna double helix the strands separate and exist solution two entirely independent these single stranded dna molecules ssdna have single common but some conformations are more stable than sense and antisense sense molecular dna sequence called sense its sequence the same that messenger rna copy that translated into the sequence the opposite strand called the antisense sequence both sense and antisense sequences can exist different parts the same strand dna both strands can contain both sense and antisense both prokaryotes and antisense rna sequences are but the functions these rnas are not entirely one proposal that antisense rnas are involved regulating gene expression through rna base few dna sequences prokaryotes and and more plasmids and viruses blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands having overlapping genes these some dna sequences double encoding one protein when read along one and second protein when read the opposite direction along the other bacteria this overlap may involved the regulation gene while overlapping genes increase the amount information that can encoded within the small viral supercoiling dna supercoil dna can twisted like rope process called dna supercoiling with dna its relaxed state strand usually circles the axis the double helix once every base but the dna twisted the strands become more tightly more loosely the dna twisted the direction the this positive and the bases are held more tightly they are twisted the opposite this negative and the bases come apart more most dna has slight negative supercoiling that introduced enzymes called topoisomerases these enzymes are also needed relieve the twisting stresses introduced into dna strands during processes such transcription and dna replication alternate dna structures molecular structure nucleic structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid molecular models dna dna structure dna exists many possible conformations that include dna and dna forms although only dna and dna have been directly observed functional the conformation that dna adopts depends the hydration dna the amount and direction chemical modifications the the type and concentration metal ions well the presence polyamines the first published reports dna ray diffraction patterns and also used analyses based patterson transforms that provided only limited amount structural information for oriented fibers alternate analysis was then proposed wilkins for the vivo dna ray scattering patterns highly hydrated dna fibers terms squares bessel functions the same james watson and francis crick presented their molecular modeling analysis the dna ray diffraction patterns suggest that the structure was although the dna most common under the conditions found not defined conformation but family related dna conformations that occur the high hydration levels present living their corresponding ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic molecular paracrystals with significant degree compared the dna form wider handed with wide minor groove and deeper major the form occurs under physiological conditions partially dehydrated samples while the cell may produced hybrid pairings dna and rna well dna segments dna where the bases have been chemically modified methylation may undergo larger change conformation and adopt the form here the strands turn about the helical axis left handed spiral the opposite the more common these unusual structures can recognized specific dna binding proteins and may involved the regulation alternative dna chemistry for number years exobiologists have proposed the existence shadow biosphere postulated microbial biosphere earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known one the proposals was the existence lifeforms that use arsenic instead phosphorus dna report the possibility the bacterium gfaj was though the research was and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation arsenic into the dna backbone and other quadruplex structures quadruplex the ends the linear chromosomes are specialized regions dna called telomeres the main function these regions allow the cell replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase the enzymes that normally replicate dna cannot copy the extreme ends these specialized chromosome caps also help protect the dna and stop the dna repair systems the cell from treating them damage human cells telomeres are usually lengths stranded dna containing several thousand repeats simple ttaggg telomere these rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends forming structures stacked sets base rather than the usual base pairs found other dna here four guanine bases form flat plate and these flat base units then stack top each form stable quadruplex structure these structures are stabilized hydrogen bonding between the edges the bases and chelation metal ion the centre each base other structures can also with the central set four bases coming from either single strand folded around the several different parallel each contributing one base the central addition these stacked telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere here the stranded dna curls around long circle stabilized binding the very end the the stranded telomere dna held onto region stranded dna the telomere strand disrupting the helical dna and base pairing one the two this triple stranded structure called displacement loop loop branched dna branched dna branched dna dna nanotechnology dna fraying occurs when complementary regions exist the end otherwise complementary strand however branched dna can occur third strand dna introduced and contains adjoining regions able hybridize with the frayed regions the existing although the simplest example branched dna involves only three strands complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also branched dna can used nanotechnology construct geometric see the section uses technology below chemical modifications and altered dna packaging cytosine methylcytosine thymine deamination base modifications and dna packaging dna methylation chromatin remodeling the expression genes influenced how the dna packaged structure called chromatin base modifications can involved with regions that have low gene expression usually containing high levels methylation cytosine bases dna packaging and its influence gene expression can also occur covalent modifications the histone protein core around which dna wrapped the chromatin structure else remodeling carried out chromatin remodeling complexes see chromatin remodeling there further crosstalk between dna methylation and histone they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene for one cytosine produces methylcytosine which important for chromosome inactivation the average level methylation varies between the worm caenorhabditis elegans lacks cytosine while vertebrates have higher with their dna containing despite the importance can deaminate leave thymine methylated cytosines are particularly prone mutations other base modifications include adenine methylation the presence hydroxymethylcytosine the brain and the glycosylation uracil produce the kinetoplastids damage dna damage naturally mutation dna damage theory aging covalent adduct metabolically activated pyrene mutagen tobacco smoke dna can damaged many sorts mutagens which change the dna mutagens include oxidizing agents alkylating agents and also energy electromagnetic radiation such ultraviolet light and rays the type dna damage produced depends the type for light can damage dna producing thymine dimers which are links between pyrimidine the other oxidants such free radicals hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms including base particularly and strand typical human cell contains about bases that have suffered oxidative these oxidative the most dangerous are strand these are difficult repair and can produce point mutations insertions and deletions from the dna well chromosomal translocations these mutations can cause cancer because inherent limitations the dna repair humans lived long they would all eventually develop dna damages that are naturally occurring due normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen the hydrolytic activities cellular etc also occur although most these damages are any cell some dna damage may remain despite the action repair these remaining dna damages accumulate with age mammalian postmitotic this accumulation appears important underlying cause many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base this called intercalation most intercalators are aromatic and planar examples include ethidium bromide acridines daunomycin and doxorubicin for intercalator fit between base the bases must distorting the dna strands unwinding the double this inhibits both transcription and dna causing toxicity and dna intercalators may carcinogens and the case teratogen others such benzo pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form dna adducts that induce errors nevertheless due their ability inhibit dna transcription and other similar toxins are also used chemotherapy inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells biological functions nuclear dna dna usually occurs linear chromosomes eukaryotes and circular chromosomes prokaryotes the set chromosomes cell makes its genome the human genome has approximately billion base pairs dna arranged into chromosomes the information carried dna held the sequence pieces dna called genes transmission genetic information genes achieved via complementary base for when cell uses the information the dna sequence copied into complementary rna sequence through the attraction between the dna and the correct rna usually this rna copy then used make matching protein sequence process called translation which depends the same interaction between rna alternative cell may simply copy its genetic information process called dna the details these functions are covered other here focus the interactions between dna and other molecules that mediate the function the genes and genomes cell nucleus chromatin chromosome gene noncoding dna genomic dna tightly and orderly packed the process called dna condensation fit the small available volumes the dna located the cell nucleus well small amounts mitochondria and chloroplasts the dna held within irregularly shaped body the cytoplasm called the nucleoid the genetic information genome held within and the complete set this information organism called its genotype gene unit heredity and region dna that influences particular characteristic genes contain open reading frame that can well regulatory sequences such promoters and enhancers which control the transcription the open reading many species only small fraction the total sequence the genome encodes for only about the human genome consists coding exons with over human dna consisting coding repetitive sequences the reasons for the presence much noncoding dna eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences genome size value among species represent standing puzzle known the value enigma however some dna sequences that not code protein may still encode functional non coding rna molecules which are involved the regulation gene expression rna polymerase some noncoding dna sequences play structural roles telomeres and centromeres typically contain few but are important for the function and stability abundant form noncoding dna humans are pseudogenes which are copies genes that have been disabled these sequences are usually just molecular fossils although they can occasionally serve raw genetic material for the creation new genes through the process gene duplication and divergence transcription and translation genetic code transcription protein biosynthesis gene sequence dna that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype within the sequence bases along dna strand defines messenger rna sequence which then defines one more protein the relationship between the nucleotide sequences genes and the amino acid sequences proteins determined the rules translation known collectively the genetic code the genetic code consists letter called codons formed from sequence three nucleotides act cag ttt the codons gene are copied into messenger rna rna polymerase this rna copy then decoded ribosome that reads the rna sequence pairing the messenger rna transfer rna which carries amino since there are bases letter there are possible codons these encode the twenty standard amino acids giving most amino acids more than one possible there are also three codons signifying the end the coding these are the tga and tag helicase topoisomerase dna polymerase leading strand lagging strand okazaki fragments dna ligase replication dna replication cell division essential for organism but when cell must replicate the dna its genome that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information their the stranded structure dna provides simple mechanism for dna replication here the two strands are separated and then each complementary dna sequence recreated enzyme called dna polymerase this enzyme makes the complementary strand finding the correct base through complementary base and bonding onto the original dna polymerases can only extend dna strand direction different mechanisms are used copy the antiparallel strands the double this the base the old strand dictates which base appears the new and the cell ends with perfect copy its interactions with proteins all the functions dna depend interactions with these protein interactions can the protein can bind specifically single dna enzymes can also bind dna and the polymerases that copy the dna base sequence transcription and dna replication are particularly dna binding proteins binding protein histones structural proteins that bind dna are understood examples specific protein within dna held complexes with structural these proteins organize the dna into compact structure called chromatin eukaryotes this structure involves dna binding complex small basic proteins called histones while prokaryotes multiple types proteins are the histones form shaped complex called nucleosome which contains two complete turns stranded dna wrapped around its these specific interactions are formed through basic residues the histones making ionic bonds the acidic phosphate backbone the and are therefore largely independent the base chemical modifications these basic amino acid residues include methylation phosphorylation and acetylation these chemical changes alter the strength the interaction between the dna and the making the dna more less accessible transcription factors and changing the rate other specific binding proteins chromatin include the mobility group which bind bent distorted these proteins are important bending arrays nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make distinct group binding proteins are the binding proteins that specifically bind stranded replication protein the understood member this family and used processes where the double helix including dna recombination and dna these binding proteins seem stabilize stranded dna and protect from forming stem loops being degraded nucleases helix helix other proteins have evolved bind particular dna the most intensively studied these are the various transcription factors which are proteins that regulate each transcription factor binds one particular set dna sequences and activates inhibits the transcription genes that have these sequences close their the transcription factors this two firstly they can bind the rna polymerase responsible for either directly through other mediator this locates the polymerase the promoter and allows begin alternatively transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones the this changes the accessibility the dna template the these dna targets can occur throughout changes the activity one type transcription factor can affect thousands consequently these proteins are often the targets the signal transduction processes that control responses environmental changes cellular differentiation and the specificity these transcription interactions with dna come from the proteins making multiple contacts the edges the dna allowing them read the dna most these interactions are made the major where the bases are most restriction enzyme ecorv dna modifying enzymes nucleases and ligases nucleases are enzymes that cut dna strands catalyzing the hydrolysis the phosphodiester bonds nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends dna strands are called exonucleases while endonucleases cut within the most frequently used nucleases molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases which cut dna specific for the ecorv enzyme shown the left recognizes the base sequence and makes cut the vertical these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection digesting the phage dna when enters the bacterial acting part the restriction modification system these specific nucleases are used molecular cloning and dna fingerprinting enzymes called dna ligases can rejoin cut broken dna ligases are particularly important lagging strand dna they join together the short segments dna produced the replication fork into complete copy the dna they are also used dna repair and genetic recombination topoisomerases and helicases topoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase these proteins change the amount supercoiling some these enzymes work cutting the dna helix and allowing one section thereby reducing its level the enzyme then seals the dna other types these enzymes are capable cutting one dna helix and then passing second strand dna through this before rejoining the topoisomerases are required for many processes involving such dna replication and helicases are proteins that are type molecular motor they use the chemical energy nucleoside triphosphates predominantly atp break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the dna double helix into single these enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need access the dna polymerases polymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates the sequence their products are created based existing polynucleotide which are called templates these enzymes function repeatedly adding nucleotide the hydroxyl group the end the growing polynucleotide all polymerases work direction the active site these the incoming nucleoside triphosphate pairs the this allows polymerases accurately synthesize the complementary strand their polymerases are classified according the type template that they dna dna dependent dna polymerases make copies dna polynucleotide order preserve biological essential that the sequence bases each copy are precisely complementary the sequence bases the template many dna polymerases have proofreading activity here the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes the synthesis reaction the lack base pairing between the mismatched mismatch exonuclease activity activated and the incorrect base most dna polymerases function large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory such the dna clamp helicases rna dependent dna polymerases are specialized class polymerases that copy the sequence rna strand into they include reverse transcriptase which viral enzyme involved the infection cells retroviruses and telomerase which required for the replication telomerase unusual polymerase because contains its own rna template part its transcription carried out dependent rna polymerase that copies the sequence dna strand into begin transcribing the rna polymerase binds sequence dna called promoter and separates the dna then copies the gene sequence into messenger rna transcript until reaches region dna called the terminator where halts and detaches from the with human dependent dna rna polymerase the enzyme that transcribes most the genes the human operates part large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory genetic recombination holliday junction genetic recombination genetic recombination dna helix usually does not interact with other segments and human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas the nucleus called chromosome this physical separation different chromosomes important for the ability dna function stable repository for one the few times chromosomes interact during chromosomal crossover when they recombine chromosomal crossover when two dna helices swap section and then recombination allows chromosomes exchange genetic information and produces new combinations which increases the efficiency natural selection and can important the rapid evolution new genetic recombination can also involved dna particularly the response strand the most common form chromosomal crossover homologous recombination where the two chromosomes involved share very similar non homologous recombination can damaging can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic the recombination reaction catalyzed enzymes known recombinases such rad the first step recombination stranded break caused either endonuclease damage the series steps catalyzed part the recombinase then leads joining the two helices least one holliday junction which segment single strand each helix annealed the complementary strand the other the holliday junction tetrahedral junction structure that can moved along the pair swapping one strand for the recombination reaction then halted cleavage the junction and ligation the released evolution rna world hypothesis dna contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things grow and however unclear how long the year history life dna has performed this has been proposed that the earliest forms life may have used rna their genetic rna may have acted the central part early cell metabolism can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis part ribozymes this ancient rna world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution the current genetic code based four nucleotide this would since the number different bases such organism off between small number bases increasing replication accuracy and large number bases increasing the catalytic efficiency however there direct evidence ancient genetic recovery dna from most fossils this because dna survives the environment for less than one million and slowly degrades into short fragments claims for older dna have been most notably report the isolation viable bacterium from salt crystal million years but these claims are august based nasa studies with meteorites found earth was published suggesting building blocks dna adenine guanine and related organic molecules may have been formed extraterrestrially outer space uses technology

also called genetic fingerprinting dna the lengths variable sections repetitive such short tandem repeats and minisatellites are compared between this method usually extremely reliable technique for

this includes dna sequence the development techniques store and search dna sequences have led widely applied advances computer science especially string searching algorithms machine learning and database theory string searching matching which find occurrence sequence letters inside larger sequence were developed search for specific sequences the dna sequence may aligned with other dna

microscopic substance the pus discarded surgical resided the nuclei called nuclein albrecht kossel isolated the protein component nuclein nucleic and later isolated its five primary nucleobases phoebus levene identified the sugar and phosphate nucleotide levene suggested that dna consisted string nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate however levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated fixed william astbury produced the first ray diffraction patterns that showed that dna had regular nikolai koltsov proposed that inherited traits would inherited via giant hereditary made two mirror strands that would replicate conservative fashion using each strand frederick griffith his experiment discovered that traits the smooth form pneumococcus could transferred the rough form the same bacteria mixing killed smooth bacteria with the live rough form this system provided the first clear suggestion that dna carries genetic the avery mccarty experiment when oswald avery along with coworkers colin macleod and maclyn mccarty identified dna the transforming principle dna role heredity was confirmed when alfred hershey and martha chase the hershey chase
