have phenotype given normal abnormal epigenetic parameters the findings developmental biology can help understand developmental abnormalities such chromosomal aberrations that cause down syndrome understanding the specialization cells during embryogenesis has provided information how stem cells specialize into specific tissues and this information has for the cloning specific organs for medical another biologically important process that occurs during development apoptosis programmed cell death many developmental models are used elucidate the physiology and molecular basis this cellular similarly deeper understanding developmental biology can foster greater progress the treatment congenital disorders and studying human sex determination can lead treatment for disorders such congenital adrenal hyperplasia developmental model organisms often used model organisms developmental biology include the vertebrates zebrafish danio rerio medakafish oryzias latipes fugu pufferfish

budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae bacteria bacillus subtilis studied phenomena cell differentiation differentiation the formation cell types from what originally one cell the zygote spore the formation cell types such nerve cells occurs with number less differentiated cell cell stays certain cell type maintaining particular pattern gene expression this depends regulatory for transcription factors and signaling these can take part perpetuating circuits the gene regulatory network circuits that can involve several cells that communicate with each external signals can alter gene expression activating receptor which triggers signaling cascade that affects transcription for the withdrawal growth factors from myoblasts causes them stop dividing and instead differentiate into muscle cells embryonic development human embryogenesis embryogenesis the step the life cycle after fertilization the development the embryo starting from the zygote fertilized organisms can differ drastically how the embryo especially when they belong different phyla for embryonal development placental mammals starts with cleavage the zygote into eight uncommitted which then form ball morula the outer cells become the trophectoderm which will form combination with maternal uterine endometrial tissue the placenta needed for fetal nurturing via maternal while inner cells become the inner cell mass that will form all fetal organs the bridge between these two parts eventually forms the umbilical the fruit fly zygote first forms shaped syncytium which still one cell but with many cell nuclei patterning important for determining which cells develop into which this mediated signaling between adjacent cells proteins their and gradients signaling secreted example retinoic acid which forms gradient the head tail direction retinoic acid enters cells and activates hox genes dependent manner hox genes differ how much retinoic acid they require for activation and will thus show differential rostral expression colinear fashion with their genomic hox genes code for transcription this causes different activated combinations both hox and other genes discrete anteroposterior transverse segments the neural tube neuromeres and related patterns surrounding such branchial lateral neural skin and the head tail this important for the segmentation the spine embryonic development does not always proceed and errors can result birth defects miscarriage often the reason genetic mutation chromosome abnormality but there can environmental influence like teratogens stochastic abnormal development caused mutation also evolutionary interest provides mechanism for changes body plan see evolutionary developmental biology growth growth the enlargement tissue growth continues after the embryonal and occurs through cell proliferation enlargement cells accumulation extracellular growth results adult organism that strikingly different from the the proliferating cells tend distinct from differentiated cells see stem cell and progenitor cell some tissues proliferating cells are restricted specialised such the growth plates bones but some stem cells migrate where they are such mesenchymal stem cells which can migrate from the bone marrow form muscle bone adipose the size organ frequently determines its the case the liver which grows back its previous size part growth factors such fibroblast growth factors the animal embryo and growth hormone juvenile also control the extent metamorphosis most animals have larval stage with body plan different from that the adult the larva abruptly develops into adult process called metamorphosis for caterpillars butterfly are specialized for feeding whereas adult butterflies imagos are specialised for flight and when the caterpillar has grown turns into immobile pupa here the imago develops from imaginal discs found inside the regeneration regeneration the reactivation development that missing body part grows this phenomenon has been studied particularly salamanders where the adults can reconstruct whole limb after has been researchers hope one day able induce regeneration humans see regenerative medicine there little spontaneous regeneration adult although the liver notable like for the regeneration the liver involves dedifferentiation some cells more embryonal regeneration can also studied cutting planaria causes accumulation epidermal cells the site the regeneration blastema then formed from cells lacking and differentiation occurs replace absent parts within one week the initial developmental systems
