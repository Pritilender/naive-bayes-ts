deficit hyperactivity disorder insanity organic disease psychosocial stages flareup infectious the incubation period the time between infection and the appearance the latency period the time between infection and the ability the disease spread another which may follow simultaneous with the appearance some viruses also exhibit dormant called viral latency which the virus hides the body inactive for varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox the acute phase after recovery from the virus may remain dormant nerve cells for many and later cause herpes zoster acute disease common cold chronic disease remission relapse progressive disease chronic diseases degenerative diseases stable disease static disease cure remission scope localized disease foot eye infection disseminated disease metastatic disease systemic disease influenza high blood pressure causes and transmissibility transmission only some diseases such influenza are contagious and commonly believed the organisms that cause these diseases are known pathogens and include varieties viruses protozoa and infectious diseases can mouth contact with infectious material bites insects other carriers the and from contaminated water food often via fecal contamination etc there are sexually transmitted diseases some microorganisms that are not readily spread from person person play while other diseases can prevented ameliorated with appropriate nutrition other lifestyle some such most but not forms cancer heart disease and mental are non infectious diseases many infectious diseases have partly completely genetic basis see genetic disorder and may thus transmitted from one generation social determinants health are the social conditions which people live that determine their illnesses are generally related economic political and environmental circumstances social determinants health have been recognized several health organizations such the public health agency canada and the world health organization greatly influence collective and personal the world health social determinants council also recognizes social determinants health poverty when the cause disease poorly societies tend mythologize the disease use metaphor symbol whatever that culture considers for until the bacterial cause tuberculosis was discovered experts variously ascribed the disease heredity sedentary lifestyle depressed mood and overindulgence rich all the social ills the burdens disease disease burden the impact health problem area measured financial mortality morbidity other there are several measures used quantify the burden imposed diseases the years potential life lost simple estimate the number years that life was shortened due for person dies the age from and would probably have lived until age without that then that disease has caused loss years potential ypll measurements not account for how disabled person before the measurement treats person who dies suddenly and person who died the same age after decades illness the world health organization calculated that million years potential life were lost premature the quality adjusted life year and disability adjusted life year metrics are but take into account whether the person was healthy after addition the number years lost due premature these measurements add part the years lost being unlike these measurements show the burden imposed people who are very but who live normal disease that has high but low has high daly and low the world health organization calculated that billion adjusted life years were lost disease and the developed heart disease and stroke cause the most loss but neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause the most years lost being lower respiratory tract infections diarrhea aids tuberculosis malaria neuropsychiatric conditions depression injuries motor vehicle accidents cardiovascular diseases heart attacks stroke premature birth perinatal cancer prevention preventive medicine many diseases and disorders can prevented through variety these include sanitation proper nutrition adequate exercise vaccinations circumcision male and other self care and public health measures treatments therapy medical therapies treatments are efforts cure improve disease other health the medical therapy synonymous with the word treatment among the term may refer specifically psychotherapy talk common treatments include medications surgery medical devices and self care treatments may provided organized health care system the patient family prevention preventive therapy way avoid sickness disease the first treatment cure applied after medical problem has already treatment attempts improve remove but treatments may not produce permanent especially chronic diseases cures are subset treatments that reverse diseases completely end medical problems many diseases that cannot completely cured are still pain management also called pain that branch medicine employing interdisciplinary approach the relief pain and improvement the quality life those living with pain treatment for medical emergencies must provided often through emergency department less critical through urgent care facility epidemiology epidemiology epidemiology the study the factors that cause encourage some diseases are more common certain geographic among people with certain genetic socioeconomic different times the epidemiology considered cornerstone methodology public health and highly regarded evidence based medicine for identifying risk factors for the study communicable and communicable the work epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation study data collection and analysis including the development statistical models test hypotheses and the documentation results for submission reviewed epidemiologists also study the interaction diseases condition known syndemic epidemiologists rely number other scientific disciplines such biology better understand disease biostatistics the current raw information geographic information science store data and map disease and social science disciplines better understand proximate and distal risk epidemiology can help identify causes well guide prevention studying epidemiology faces the challenge defining especially for poorly understood different groups might use significantly different

who were historically shunned because they had infectious and the term leper still evokes social stigma fear disease can still widespread social though not all diseases evoke extreme social social

different the term diseases civilization describes diseases that are more common among older for cancer far more common societies which most members live until they reach the age than societies which most members die before they reach the age language disease illness narrative way organizing medical experience into coherent story that illustrates the sick personal people use metaphors make sense their experiences with the metaphors move disease from objective thing that exists affective experience the most popular metaphors draw military concepts disease enemy that must fought battled and the patient the healthcare provider rather than passive victim the agents communicable diseases are non communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection civil because the threat perhaps matter life and unthinkably even measures are and the moral duty they courageously mobilize struggle against the war cancer example this metaphorical use this language empowering some but leaves others feeling
