organisms and their such the interactions organisms have with each other and with their abiotic environment topics interest ecologists include the diversity distribution amount biomass number population well competition between them within and among ecosystems ecosystems are composed dynamically interacting parts including organisms the communities they make and the living components their ecosystem such primary production pedogenesis nutrient cycling and various niche construction activities regulate the flux energy and matter through these processes are sustained organisms with specific life history and the variety organisms called biodiversity biodiversity which refers the varieties species genes and ecosystems enhances certain ecosystem services ecology interdisciplinary field that includes biology and earth science the word ecology was coined the german scientist ernst haeckel ancient greek philosophers such hippocrates and aristotle laid the foundations ecology their studies natural history modern ecology transformed into more rigorous science the late evolutionary concepts adaptation and natural selection became cornerstones modern ecological theory ecology not synonymous with environmentalism natural environmental science closely related evolutionary biology genetics and ethology understanding how biodiversity affects ecological function important focus

this means that effect and cause are that small changes critical such the number nitrogen fixers can lead perhaps changes the system biodiversity biodiversity biodiversity refers the variety life and its includes the variety living the genetic differences among the communities and ecosystems which they and the ecological and evolutionary processes that keep them yet ever changing and biodiversity abbreviation biological describes the diversity life from genes ecosystems and spans every level biological the term has several and there are many ways measure characterize and represent its complex biodiversity includes species diversity ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity and scientists are interested the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating and among these respective biodiversity plays important role ecosystem services which definition maintain and improve human quality preventing species extinctions one way preserve biodiversity and that goal rests techniques that preserve genetic habitat and the ability for species citation needed conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations address the full ecological scope natural capital that supports populations critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration riverine fish runs and avian insect has been implicated one mechanism which those service losses are understanding biodiversity has practical applications for species and level conservation planners they make management recommendations consulting governments and habitat habitat the habitat species describes the environment over which species known occur and the type community that formed more habitats can defined regions environmental space that are composed multiple each representing biotic abiotic environmental that any component characteristic the environment related directly forage biomass and indirectly elevation the use location the for habitat might aquatic terrestrial environment that can further categorized montane alpine ecosystem habitat shifts provide important evidence competition nature where one population changes relative the habitats that most other individuals the species for one population species tropical lizards tropidurus hispidus has flattened body relative the main populations that live open the population that lives isolated rock outcrop hides crevasses where its flattened body offers selective habitat shifts also occur the developmental life history amphibians and insects that transition from aquatic terrestrial biotope and habitat are sometimes used but the former applies whereas the latter applies environment additionally some species are ecosystem engineers altering the environment within localized for beavers manage water levels building dams which improves their habitat coral reef corals calcium carbonate niche ecological niche termite definitions the niche date back but evelyn hutchinson made conceptual advances introducing widely adopted the set biotic and abiotic conditions which species able persist and maintain stable population the ecological niche central concept the ecology organisms and divided into the fundamental and the realized niche the fundamental niche the set environmental conditions under which species able the realized niche the set environmental plus ecological conditions under which species the hutchinsonian niche defined more technically euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined environmental variables and whose size function the number values that the environmental values may assume for which organism has positive fitness biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained predicted through knowledge traits and niche species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted the ecological trait measurable phenotype characteristic organism that may influence its genes play important role the interplay development and environmental expression resident species evolve traits that are fitted the selection pressures their local this tends afford them competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having overlapping geographic the competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely living off the same limiting one will always outcompete the when similarly adapted species overlap closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences their habitat dietary some models and empirical however suggest that disturbances can stabilize the coevolution and shared niche

beaver pond global over time and even after such decaying logs silica skeleton deposits from marine the process and concept ecosystem engineering related niche construction but the former relates only the physical modifications the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications physical changes the environment and the feedback this causes the process natural ecosystem engineers are defined organisms that directly indirectly modulate the availability resources other causing physical state changes biotic abiotic doing they maintain and create the ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated new appreciation for the influence that organisms have the ecosystem and evolutionary the term niche more often used reference the appreciated feedback mechanisms natural selection imparting forces the abiotic example natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs the nests social insects including bees wasps and there emergent homeostasis homeorhesis

organization that categorize regions the mainly according the structure and composition there are different methods define the continental boundaries biomes dominated different functional types vegetative communities that are limited distribution precipitation weather and other environmental biomes include tropical rainforest temperate broadleaf and mixed forest temperate deciduous forest taiga tundra hot desert and polar desert other researchers have recently categorized other such the human and oceanic microbiomes the human body habitat and microbiomes were discovered largely through

used explain emergent regulatory phenomena the planetary for the gaia hypothesis example holism applied ecological the gaia hypothesis states that there emergent feedback loop generated the metabolism living organisms that maintains the core temperature the earth and atmospheric conditions within narrow regulating range population ecology population ecology lists organisms population population ecology studies the dynamics specie populations and how these populations interact with the wider population consists individuals the same species that interact and migrate through the same niche and primary law population ecology the malthusian growth model which population will grow exponentially long the environment experienced all individuals the population remains simplified population models usually start with four death birth immigration and emigration example introductory population model describes closed such where immigration and emigration does not take hypotheses are evaluated with reference null hypothesis which states that random processes create the observed these island the rate population change described where the total number individuals the the number the number and are the per capita rates birth and death and the per capita rate population the formula states that the rate change population size equal births minus deaths using these modelling malthus population principle growth was later transformed into model known the logistic equation where the number individuals measured biomass density the maximum capita rate and the carrying capacity the the formula states that the rate change population size equal growth that limited carrying capacity population ecology builds upon these introductory models further understand demographic processes real study commonly used types data include life history fecundity and and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such matrix algebra the information used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest cases where basic models are ecologists may adopt different kinds statistical such the akaike information criterion use models that can become mathematically complex several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the metapopulations and migration metapopulation animal migration the concept metapopulations was defined population populations which extinct locally and metapopulation ecology another statistical approach that often used conservation research metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches varying levels and metapopulations are linked the migratory behaviours animal migration set apart from other kinds movement because involves the seasonal departure and return individuals from migration also level with the migration routes followed plants they occupied northern glacial plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify wetlands reconstruct the timing plant migration and dispersal relative historic and contemporary these migration routes involved expansion the range plant populations expanded from one area there larger taxonomy such foraging territorial stasis and dispersal usually distinguished from migration because involves the one way permanent movement individuals from their birth population into another metapopulation migrating individuals are classed emigrants when they leave immigrants when they enter and sites are classed either sources site generic term that refers places where ecologists sample such ponds defined sampling areas source patches are productive sites that generate seasonal supply juveniles that migrate other patch sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive the population the site will disappear unless rescued adjacent source patch environmental conditions become more metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time answer potential questions about spatial and demographic the ecology metapopulations dynamic process extinction and small patches lower quality sinks are maintained rescued seasonal influx new dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year where some patches are sinks dry years and are sources when conditions are more ecologists use mixture computer models and field studies explain metapopulation community ecology community ecology predation community ecology community ecology examines how interactions among species and their environment affect the distribution and diversity species within community ecology the study the interactions among collections species that inhabit the same geographic research community ecology might measure primary production wetland relation decomposition and consumption this requires understanding the community connections between plants primary and the decomposers fungi and the analysis prey dynamics affecting amphibian food webs and trophic levels are two widely employed conceptual models used explain the linkages among ecosystem ecology ecosystem ecology these may call are the most various kinds and they form one category the multitudinous physical systems the which range from the universe whole down the riparian forest white mountains new hampshire ecosystem ecology ecosystems are habitats within biomes that form integrated whole and dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological the underlying concept can traced back the published work george perkins marsh man and within organisms are linked the physical and biological components their environment which they are ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction life processes form organizing patterns across different scales time and ecosystems are broadly categorized terrestrial freshwater atmospheric marine differences stem from the nature the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within more recent addition ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems which are affected primarily the result human food webs food web food chain food web the archetypal ecological network plants capture solar energy and use synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis plants they accumulate nutrients and are eaten grazing herbivores and the energy transferred through chain organisms the simplified linear feeding pathways that move from basal trophic species top consumer called the food chain the larger interlocking pattern food chains ecological community creates complex food food webs are type concept map heuristic device that used illustrate and study pathways energy and material chesapeake bay food webs are often limited relative the real complete empirical measurements are generally restricted specific such cave and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated larger feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents which can difficult stable isotopes can used trace the flow nutrient diets and energy through food despite these food webs remain valuable tool understanding community food webs exhibit principles ecological emergence through the nature trophic some species have many weak feeding links omnivores while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links primary predators theoretical and empirical studies identify non random emergent patterns few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over food webs are composed subgroups where members community are linked strong and the weak interactions occur between these this increases food web step step lines relations are drawn until web life trophic levels trophic level ecological relationships boreal trophic level from greek troph troph meaning food feeding group organisms acquiring considerable majority its energy from the adjacent level nearer the abiotic links food webs primarily connect feeding relations trophism among biodiversity within ecosystems can organized into trophic which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base the food chain toward top and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance biomass each when the relative abundance biomass each species sorted into its respective trophic they naturally sort into pyramid species are broadly categorized autotrophs primary producers heterotrophs consumers and detritivores decomposers autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food production greater than photosynthesis chemosynthesis heterotrophs are organisms that must feed others for nourishment and energy respiration exceeds heterotrophs can further divided into different functional including primary consumers strict secondary consumers carnivorous predators that feed exclusively and tertiary consumers predators that feed mix herbivores and omnivores not fit neatly into functional category because they eat both plant and animal has been suggested that omnivores have greater functional influence because compared herbivores they are relatively inefficient trophic levels are part the holistic complex systems view each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological giving macroscopic view the while the notion trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and down control within food troubled the prevalence omnivory real this has led some ecologists reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into homogeneous trophic levels nonetheless recent studies have shown that real trophic levels but above the herbivore trophic food webs are better characterized tangled web keystone species keystone species sea otters keystone species species that connected disproportionately large number other species the food web keystone species have lower levels biomass the trophic pyramid relative the importance their the many connections that keystone species holds means that maintains the organization and structure entire the loss keystone species results range dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic other food web and can cause the extinction other sea otters enhydra lutris are commonly cited example keystone species because they limit the density sea urchins that feed kelp sea otters are removed from the the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear and this has dramatic effect community hunting sea for thought have indirectly led the extinction the steller sea cow hydrodamalis gigas while the keystone species concept has been used extensively conservation tool has been criticized for being poorly defined from operational difficult experimentally determine what species may hold keystone role each furthermore food web theory suggests that keystone species may not unclear how generally the keystone species model can ecological complexity complexity emergence complexity understood large computational effort needed piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity the human global

specification and social ecology social ecology social ecological behaviours are notable the social insects slime moulds social spiders human society and naked mole rats where eusocialism has social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group kin selection explains altruism through genetic whereby altruistic behaviour leading death rewarded the survival genetic copies distributed among surviving the social including ants bees and wasps are most famously studied for this type relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic every other male the group selectionists find examples altruism among genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting the whereby becomes selectively advantageous for groups their members express altruistic behaviours one groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish coevolution coevolution bumblebees flowers pollinate ecological interactions can classified broadly into host and associate host any entity that harbours another that called the relationships within species that are mutually reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms examples mutualism include fungus growing ants employing agricultural bacteria living the guts insects and other the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae and corals with photosynthetic there physical connection between host and the relationship called symbiosis approximately all for have symbiotic relationship with arbuscular

globally altered biogeochemical history history ecology early beginnings ecology has complex due large part its interdisciplinary ancient greek philosophers such hippocrates and aristotle were among the first record observations natural however they viewed life terms essentialism where species were conceptualized static unchanging things while varieties were seen aberrations idealized type this contrasts against the modern understanding ecological theory where varieties are viewed the real phenomena interest and having role the origins adaptations means natural selection early conceptions such balance and regulation nature can traced herodotus died who described one the earliest accounts mutualism his observation natural basking nile crocodiles would open their mouths give sandpipers safe access pluck leeches out giving nutrition the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the aristotle was early influence the philosophical development and his student theophrastus made extensive observations plant and animal biogeography physiology and their giving early analogue the modern concept ecological ecological concepts such food population and productivity were first developed the through the published works microscopist antoni van leeuwenhoek and botanist richard bradley biogeographer alexander von humboldt was early pioneer ecological thinking and was among the first recognize ecological where species are replaced altered form along environmental gradients such cline forming along rise humboldt drew inspiration from isaac newton developed form terrestrial newtonian brought scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded concepts that are the foundation modern ecological law area natural such james hutton and jean baptiste lamarck among laid the foundations the modern ecological the term ecology german oekologie kologie more recent origin and was first coined the german biologist ernst haeckel his book generelle morphologie der organismen haeckel was artist writer and later life professor comparative mean the whole science the relations the organism the environment the broad all the conditions thus the theory evolution explains the housekeeping relations organisms mechanistically the necessary consequences effectual causes and forms the monistic groundwork ernst haeckel eugenius warming opinions differ who was the founder modern ecological some mark definition the others say was eugenius warming with the writing oecology introduction the study plant communities carl linnaeus principles the economy nature that matured the early linnaeus founded early branch ecology that called the economy his works influenced charles who adopted phrase the economy polity nature the origin species linnaeus was the first frame the balance nature testable haeckel who admired defined ecology reference the economy which has led some question whether ecology and the economy nature are woburn abbey the origin species from aristotle until the natural world was predominantly considered static and prior the origin species there was little appreciation understanding the dynamic and reciprocal relations between their and the exception the publication natural history selborne gilbert white considered some one the earliest texts while charles darwin mainly noted for his treatise was one the founders soil ecology and made note the first ecological experiment the origin species evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological nowhere can one see more clearly illustrated what may called the sensibility such organic expressed the fact that whatever affects any species belonging must speedily have its influence some sort upon the whole will thus made see the impossibility studying any form out relation the other the necessity for taking comprehensive survey the whole condition satisfactory understanding any since modern ecology young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end the century around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific notable scientist ellen swallow richards may have first introduced the term oekology which eventually morphed into home economics the early the early ecology transitioned from more descriptive form natural history more analytical form scientific natural history frederic clements published the first american ecology book presenting the idea plant communities superorganism this publication launched debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the clements superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages seral development that are analogous the developmental stages the clementsian paradigm was challenged henry gleason who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association individual this perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories individual organisms and how this relates the development community the clementsian superorganism theory was overextended application idealistic form the term holism was coined jan christiaan smuts south african general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired superorganism around the same charles elton pioneered the concept food chains his classical book animal ecology elton defined ecological relations using concepts food food and food and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative elton food was replaced food subsequent ecological alfred lotka brought many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles raymond lindeman wrote landmark paper the trophic dynamics which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical trophic dynamics became the foundation for much the work follow energy and material flow through robert macarthur advanced mathematical predictions and tests ecology the which inspired resurgent school theoretical mathematical ecology also has developed through contributions from other including vladimir vernadsky and his founding the biosphere concept the and kinji imanishi and his concepts harmony nature and habitat segregation the scientific recognition contributions ecology from speaking cultures hampered language and translation this whole chain then seems rest base minute plants which must have been the original but what the opposite end the food the human being probable ignorance all this sequence has rigged his fishing caught string fish from the waters clear and taken them home fry for his ecology surged popular and scientific interest during the environmental movement there are strong historical and scientific ties between environmental and the historic emphasis and poetic naturalist writings for protection was wild from notable ecologists the history conservation biology such aldo leopold and arthur tansley were far removed from urban centres where the concentration pollution and environmental degradation palamar notes overshadowing mainstream environmentalism pioneering women the early who fought for urban health ecology then called euthenics and brought about changes environmental women such ellen swallow richards and julia lathrop among were precursors the more popularized environmental movements after the marine biologist and ecologist rachel carson book silent spring helped mobilize the environmental movement alerting the public toxic pesticides such ddt bioaccumulating the carson
