conjunction with the nonliving components their environment things like water and mineral interacting these biotic and abiotic components are regarded linked together through nutrient cycles and energy ecosystems are defined the network interactions among and between organisms and their they can any size but usually encompass limited spaces although some scientists say that the entire planet energy water nitrogen and soil minerals are other essential abiotic components the energy that flows through ecosystems obtained primarily from the generally enters the system through photosynthesis process that also captures carbon from the feeding plants and one animals play important role the movement matter and energy through the they also influence the quantity plant and microbial biomass present breaking down dead organic decomposers release carbon back the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling converting nutrients stored dead biomass back form that can readily used plants and other ecosystems are controlled both external and internal external factors such climate the parent material which forms the soil and topography control the overall structure ecosystem and the way things work within but are not themselves influenced the other external factors include time and potential biota ecosystems are dynamic they are subject periodic disturbances and are the process recovering from some past ecosystems similar environments that are located different parts the world can have very different characteristics simply because they contain different the introduction native species can cause substantial shifts ecosystem internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled them and are often subject feedback loops while the resource inputs are generally controlled external processes like climate and parent the availability these resources within the ecosystem controlled internal factors like root competition other internal factors include succession and the types species although humans exist and operate within their cumulative effects are large enough influence external factors like biodiversity affects ecosystem the processes disturbance and succession ecosystems provide variety goods and services upon which people the principles ecosystem management suggest that rather than managing individual natural resources should managed the level the ecosystem classifying ecosystems into ecologically homogeneous units important step towards effective ecosystem but there agreed upon way contents history and development ecosystem processes primary production energy flow decomposition nutrient cycling function and biodiversity ecosystem goods and services ecosystem management ecosystem dynamics ecosystem ecology classification types anthropogenic threats see also notes references literature cited external links history and development the term ecosystem was first used publication british ecology arthur tansley tansley devised the concept draw attention the importance transfers materials between organisms and their later refined the describing the whole including not only the but also the whole complex physical factors forming what call the tansley regarded ecosystems not simply natural but mental tansley later defined the spatial extent ecosystems using the term ecotope evelyn hutchinson pioneering limnologist who was contemporary combined charles elton ideas about trophic ecology with those russian geochemist vladimir vernadsky suggest that mineral nutrient availability lake limited algal production which limit the abundance animals that feed raymond lindeman took these ideas one step further suggest that the flow energy through lake was the primary driver the hutchinson brothers howard odum and eugene odum further developed systems the study allowing them study the flow energy and material through ecological ecosystem processes energy and carbon enter ecosystems through are incorporated into living transferred other organisms that feed the living and dead plant and eventually released through most mineral the other are recycled within ecosystems are controlled both external and internal external also called state control the overall structure ecosystem and the way things work within but are not themselves influenced the the most important these climate climate determines the biome which the ecosystem rainfall patterns and temperature seasonality determine the amount water available the ecosystem and the supply energy available influencing parent material the underlying geological material that gives rise determines the nature the soils and influences the supply mineral topography also controls ecosystem processes affecting things like microclimate soil development and the movement water through this may the difference between the ecosystem present wetland situated small depression the and one present adjacent steep other external factors that play important role ecosystem functioning include time and potential biota ecosystems are dynamic they are subject periodic disturbances and are the process recovering from some past time plays role the development soil from bare rock and the recovery community from disturbance similarly the set organisms that can potentially present area can also have major impact ecosystems similar environments that are located different parts the world can end doing things very differently simply because they have different pools species the introduction native species can cause substantial shifts ecosystem unlike external internal factors ecosystems not only control ecosystem but are also controlled consequently they are often subject feedback loops while the resource inputs are generally controlled external processes like climate and parent the availability these resources within the ecosystem controlled internal factors like root competition other factors like succession the types species present are also internal human activities are important almost all although humans exist and operate within their cumulative effects are large enough influence external factors like primary production phototroph autotroph seawifs nasa goddard space flight center orbimage primary production primary production the production organic matter from inorganic carbon overwhelmingly this occurs through the energy incorporated through this process supports life while the carbon makes much the organic matter living and dead soil carbon and fossil fuels also drives the carbon cycle which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect through the process plants capture energy from light and use combine carbon dioxide and water produce carbohydrates and oxygen the photosynthesis carried out all the plants ecosystem called the gross primary production about the gpp consumed plant the that portion gpp that not used known the net primary production total photosynthesis limited range environmental these include the amount light the amount leaf area plant has capture light shading other plants major limitation rate which carbon dioxide can supplied the chloroplasts support the availability and the availability suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis energy flow left carcass energy flow food web trophic level the carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues net primary either consumed animals while the plant remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes detritus terrestrial ecosystems roughly the npp ends being broken down decomposers the remainder either consumed animals while still alive and enters the based trophic consumed after has and enters the based trophic aquatic systems the proportion plant biomass that gets consumed herbivores much trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary the organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers secondary producers herbivores organisms which feed microbes bacteria and fungi are termed microbivores animals that feed primary carnivores are secondary each these constitutes trophic level the sequence from plant forms food chain real systems are much more complex than organisms will generally feed more than one form and may feed more than one trophic carnivores may capture some prey which are part based trophic system and others that are part based trophic system bird that feeds both herbivorous grasshoppers and which consume real with all these form food webs rather than food decomposition decomposition the carbon and nutrients dead organic matter are broken down group processes known this releases nutrients that can then used for plant and microbial and returns carbon dioxide the atmosphere where can used for the absence dead organic matter would accumulate ecosystem and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would approximately terrestrial npp goes directly from plant decomposition processes can separated into three leaching fragmentation and chemical alteration dead water moves through dead organic dissolves and carries with the soluble these are then taken organisms the react with mineral are transported beyond the confines the ecosystem and are considered lost newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations soluble and include sugars amino acids and mineral leaching more important wet and much less important dry fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller exposing new surfaces for colonization freshly shed leaf litter may inaccessible due outer layer cuticle bark and cell contents are protected cell wall newly dead animals may covered exoskeleton fragmentation which break through these protective accelerate the rate microbial animals fragment detritus they hunt for does passage through the freeze thaw cycles and cycles wetting and drying also fragment dead the chemical alteration dead organic matter primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal fungal hyphae produce enzymes which can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant they also produce enzymes which break down lignin which allows them access both cell contents and the nitrogen the fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and unlike are not dependent solely locally available decomposition rates vary among the rate decomposition governed three sets the physical environment moisture and soil the quantity and quality the dead material available and the nature the microbial community temperature controls the rate microbial the higher the the faster microbial decomposition also affects soil which slows microbial growth and reduces freeze thaw cycles also affect freezing temperatures kill soil which allows leaching play more important role moving nutrients this can especially important the soil thaws the creating pulse nutrients which become decomposition rates are low under very wet very dry decomposition rates are highest moist conditions with adequate levels wet soils tend become deficient oxygen this especially true wetlands which slows microbial dry decomposition slows but bacteria continue grow albeit slower even after soils become too dry support plant when the rains return and soils become the osmotic gradient between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells gain water under these many bacterial cells releasing pulse decomposition rates also tend slower acidic soils which are rich clay minerals tend have lower decomposition and higher levels organic the smaller particles clay result larger surface area that can hold the higher the water content the lower the oxygen content and the lower the rate clay minerals also bind particles organic material their making them less accessibly soil disturbance like tilling increase decomposition increasing the amount oxygen the soil and exposing new organic matter soil the quality and quantity the material available decomposers another major factor that influences the rate substances like sugars and amino acids decompose readily and are considered labile cellulose and hemicellulose which are broken down more are moderately compounds which are more resistant like lignin cutin are considered recalcitrant litter with higher proportion labile compounds decomposes much more rapidly than does litter with higher proportion recalcitrant consequently dead animals decompose more rapidly than dead which themselves decompose more rapidly than fallen organic material the soil its quality the more labile compounds decompose leaving and increasing proportion recalcitrant microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin and these also accumulate the microbes further reducing the quality older soil organic matter nutrient cycling nutrient cycle biogeochemical cycle nitrogen cycle ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider environment mineral the other are mostly cycled back and forth between animals microbes and the most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological nitrogen fixation deposited through dust gases applied fertilizer since most terrestrial ecosystems are nitrogen cycling important control ecosystem until modern nitrogen fixation was the major source nitrogen for nitrogen fixing bacteria either live symbiotically with live freely the the energetic cost high for plants which support fixing much gpp when measured controlled many members the legume plant family support fixing some cyanobacteria are also capable nitrogen these are phototrophs which carry out like other fixing they can either living have symbiotic relationships with other sources nitrogen include acid deposition produced through the combustion fossil fuels ammonia gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied and anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about all nitrogen fluxes when plant tissues are shed are the nitrogen those tissues becomes available animals and microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter the where fungi and bacteria compete for some soil bacteria use organic containing compounds source and release ammonium ions into the this process known nitrogen mineralization others convert ammonium nitrite and nitrate ions process known nitrification nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are also produced during under rich and poor nitrates and nitrites are converted nitrogen gas process known denitrification other important nutrients include phosphorus sulfur calcium potassium magnesium and manganese phosphorus enters ecosystems through weathering ecosystems age this supply making limitation more common older landscapes especially the calcium and sulfur are also produced but acid deposition important source sulfur many although magnesium and manganese are produced exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for significant portion ecosystem potassium primarily cycled between living cells and soil organic function and biodiversity biodiversity ecosystem engineer loch lomond introductions food web madagascar adansonia alluaudia procera ecosystem processes are broad generalizations that actually take place through the actions individual the nature the the functional groups and trophic levels which they dictates the sorts actions these individuals are capable carrying and the relative efficiency with which they thus ecosystem processes are driven the number species the exact nature each individual and the relative abundance organisms within these biodiversity plays important role ecosystem ecological theory suggests that order species must have some level limiting similarity they must different from one another some fundamental otherwise one species would competitively exclude the despite the cumulative effect additional species ecosystem not additional species may enhance nitrogen for but beyond some level species additional species may have little additive the addition species which are ecologically similar those already present ecosystem tends only have small effect ecosystem ecologically distinct the other have much larger similarly dominant species have large impact ecosystem while rare species tend have small keystone species tend have effect ecosystem function that disproportionate their abundance ecosystem goods and services ecosystem services ecological goods and services ecosystem valuation ecological yield ecosystems provide variety goods and services upon which people ecosystem goods include the material ecosystem construction medicinal addition less tangible items like tourism and and genes from wild plants and animals that can used improve domestic ecosystem the other are generally improvements the condition location things these include things like the maintenance hydrological cleaning air and the maintenance oxygen the crop pollination and even things like inspiration and opportunities for while ecosystem goods have traditionally been recognized being the basis for things economic ecosystem services tend taken for while gretchen daily original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem robert costanza and later work and that the millennium ecosystem assessment lumped all these together ecosystem ecosystem management ecosystem management ecological economics sustainability sustainable development when natural resource management applied whole rather than single termed ecosystem variety definitions stuart chapin

for livelihood are although definitions ecosystem management there common set principles which underlie these fundamental principle the term sustainability the production goods and services the intergenerational sustainability precondition for not also requires clear goals with respect future trajectories and behaviors the system being other important requirements include sound ecological

temperate rainforest olympic peninsula washington state high peaks wilderness area adirondack park ecosystems are dynamic they are subject periodic disturbances and are the process recovering from some past when ecosystem subject some sort perturbation responds moving away from its initial the tendency system remain close its equilibrium despite that termed its resistance the other the speed with which returns its initial state after disturbance called its resilience from one year ecosystems experience variation their biotic and abiotic especially cold winter and pest outbreak all constitute term variability environmental animal populations vary from year building during rich periods and crashing they overshoot their food these changes play out changes decomposition and other ecosystem longer term changes also shape ecosystem the forests eastern north america still show legacies cultivation which ceased years while methane production eastern siberian lakes controlled organic matter which accumulated during the pleistocene disturbance also plays important role ecological stuart chapin and coauthors define disturbance relatively discrete event time and space that alters the structure communities and ecosystems and causes changes resources availability the physical this can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks hurricanes and wildfires volcanic eruptions and can cause large changes animal and microbe well soil organic matter disturbance followed succession directional change ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes resources the frequency and severity disturbance determines the way impacts ecosystem major disturbance like volcanic eruption glacial advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack animals organic ecosystems that experience disturbances that undergo primary succession less severe disturbance like forest hurricanes cultivation result secondary succession more severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result longer recovery ecosystems recover more quickly from less severe disturbance the early stages primary succession are dominated species with small propagules seed and which can dispersed long the early often algae cyanobacteria and lichens stabilize the nitrogen supplies are limited new and fixing species tend play important role early primary unlike primary the species that dominate secondary are usually present from the start the often the soil seed bank some systems the successional pathways are fairly and are easy there are many possible for the introduced fixing

ecosystem can encompass much larger even the whole schulze and coauthors also rejected the idea that single rotting log could studied ecosystem because the size the flows between the log and its surroundings are too relative the proportion cycles within the philosopher science mark sagoff considers the failure define the kind object obstacle the development theory ecosystem ecosystems can studied through variety theoretical studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods those that look differences between ecosystems elucidate how they work and direct manipulative studies can carried out variety from microcosms and mesocosms which serve simplified representations through ecosystem american ecologist stephen carpenter has argued that microcosm experiments can irrelevant and they are not carried out conjunction with field studies carried out the ecosystem because microcosm experiments often fail accurately predict level the hubbard brook ecosystem study established the
