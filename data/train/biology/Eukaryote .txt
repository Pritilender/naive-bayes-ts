are formally the taxon eukarya eukaryota the defining bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells the nucleus nuclear envelope within which the genetic material the presence nucleus gives eukaryotes their which comes from the greek well and karyon nut kernel most eukaryotic cells also contain other bound organelles such mitochondria the golgi apparatus plants and algae contain chloroplasts many unicellular organisms are such protozoa all multicellular organisms are including animals plants and fungi cell division eukaryotes different from that organisms without nucleus prokaryote there are two types division mitosis one cell divides produce two genetically identical meiosis which required sexual reproduction one diploid cell having two instances each one from each undergoes recombination each pair parental and then two stages cell resulting four haploid cells gametes each gamete has just one complement each unique mix the corresponding pair parental the domain eukaryota appears monophyletic and makes one the three domains the two other bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes and have none the above eukaryotes represent tiny minority all

endomembrane system and mitochondria hypotheses for the origin eukaryotes autogenous models chimeric models see also references external links cell features eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those prokaryotes they have variety internal membranes and called organelles and cytoskeleton composed microtubules microfilaments and intermediate filaments which play important role defining the organization and eukaryotic dna divided into several linear bundles called chromosomes which are separated microtubular spindle during nuclear internal membrane eukaryote cells include variety bound collectively referred the endomembrane system simple called vesicles vacuoles can form budding off other many cells ingest food and other materials through process endocytosis where the outer membrane invaginates and then pinches off form probable that most other bound organelles are ultimately derived from such the nucleus surrounded double membrane commonly referred nuclear envelope with pores that allow material move and various and like extensions the nuclear membrane form what called the endoplasmic reticulum which involved protein transport and includes the rough where ribosomes are attached synthesize which enter the interior space subsequently they generally enter which bud off from the smooth most these carrying vesicles are released and further modified stacks flattened called golgi bodies vesicles may specialized for various for lysosomes contain enzymes that break down the contents food and peroxisomes are used break down peroxide which toxic many protozoa have contractile which collect and expel excess and extrusomes which expel material used deflect predators capture higher most volume taken central which primarily maintains its osmotic mitochondria and plastids mitochondria are organelles found nearly all they are surrounded two membranes each phospholipid layer the inner which folded into invaginations called where aerobic respiration takes mitochondria contain their own they are now generally held have developed from endosymbiotic prokaryotes probably proteobacteria the few protozoa that lack mitochondria have been found contain derived such hydrogenosomes and mitosomes and thus probably lost the mitochondria plants and various groups algae also have plastids again these have their own dna and developed from this case cyanobacteria they usually take the form chloroplasts which like cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll and produce organic compounds such glucose through photosynthesis others are involved storing although plastids likely had single not all containing groups are closely instead some eukaryotes have obtained them from others through secondary endosymbiosis endosymbiotic origins have also been proposed for the for which see and for eukaryotic flagella supposed have developed from spirochaetes clarification needed this not generally both from lack cytological evidence and difficulty reconciling this with cellular cytoskeletal structures cytoskeleton this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed july chlamydomonas reinhardtii many eukaryotes have long slender motile cytoplasmic called flagella similar structures called cilia flagella and cilia are sometimes referred undulipodia and are variously involved feeding and they are composed mainly tubulin these are entirely distinct from prokaryotic they are supported bundle microtubules arising from basal body also called kinetosome centriole characteristically arranged nine doublets surrounding two flagella also may have mastigonemes and scales connecting membranes and internal their interior continuous with the cytoplasm microfilamental structures composed actin and actin binding actinin fimbrin filamin are present submembraneous cortical layers and motor proteins dynein kinesin and myosins provide dynamic character the centrioles are often present even cells and groups that not have but conifers and flowering plants have they generally occur groups one called kinetids that give rise various microtubular these form primary component the cytoskeletal and are often assembled over the course several cell with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from centrioles may also associated the formation spindle during nuclear the significance cytoskeletal structures underlined the determination shape the well their being essential components migratory responses like chemotaxis and chemokinesis some protists have various other supported these include the radiolaria and heliozoa which produce axopodia used flotation capture and the haptophytes which have peculiar like organelle called the haptonema cell wall cell wall the cells fungi and most chromalveolates have cell layer outside the cell membrane providing the cell with structural citation needed protection and filtering the cell wall also prevents expansion when water enters the the major polysaccharides making the primary cell wall land plants are cellulose hemicellulose and pectin the cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers form the hemicellulose which embedded the pectin the most common hemicellulose the primary cell wall xyloglucan differences among eukaryotic cells there are many different types eukaryotic though animals and plants are the most familiar and thus provide excellent starting point for understanding eukaryotic fungi and many protists have some substantial however animal cell plant cell animal cell form eukaryotic cell that makes many tissues animals animal cells are distinct from other most notably plant cells they lack cell walls and chloroplasts they also have smaller vacuoles due the lack cell wall animal cells can adopt variety phagocytic cell can even engulf other there are many different types cell for there are approximately distinct cell types the adult human body plant cell plant cell plant cells are quite different from the cells the other eukaryotic their distinctive features large central vacuole enclosed the tonoplast which maintains the turgor and controls movement molecules between the cytosol and sap primary cell wall containing cellulose hemicellulose and pectin deposited the protoplast the outside the cell membrane this contrasts with the cell walls fungi which contain chitin and the cell envelopes which peptidoglycans are the main structural molecules the plasmodesmata linking pores the cell wall that allow each plant cell communicate with other adjacent this different from the functionally analogous system gap junctions between animal plastids especially chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll the pigment that gives plants their green color and allows them perform photosynthesis bryophytes and seedless vascular plants lack flagellae and centrioles except the sperm sperm cycads and gingko are complex cells that swim with hundreds thousands conifers and flowering plants lack the flagellae and centrioles that are present animal cells fungal cell fungal hyphae cells ergosterol rper fungal cells are most similar animal with the following cell wall that contains chitin less definition between the hyphae higher fungi have porous partitions called septa which allow the passage organelles and sometimes nuclei primitive fungi have few each organism essentially giant multinucleate these fungi are described coenocytic only the most primitive chytrids have other eukaryotic cells eukaryotes are very diverse and their cell structures are equally many have cell many many have derived from secondary even tertiary and many some groups have unique such the cyanelles the glaucophytes the haptonema the haptophytes the ejectisomes the cryptomonads other such pseudopods are found various eukaryote groups different such the lobose amoebozoans the reticulose foraminiferans reproduction nuclear division often coordinated with cell division this generally takes place mitosis process that allows each daughter nucleus receive one copy each most there also process sexual typically involving alternation between haploid generations wherein only one copy each chromosome and diploid generations wherein two are occurring through nuclear fusion and meiosis there considerable variation this however eukaryotes have smaller surface area volume ratio than and thus have lower metabolic rates and longer generation some multicellular cells specialized for metabolism will have enlarged surface such intestinal sexual reproduction sexual reproduction widespread among present day and evidence suggests that primordial and fundamental characteristic based phylogenetic dacks and roger proposed that facultative sex was present the common ancestor all core set genes that function meiosis present both trichomonas vaginalis and giardia intestinalis two organisms previously thought since these two species are descendants lineages that diverged early from the eukaryotic evolutionary was inferred that core meiotic and hence were likely present common ancestor all other studies eukaryotic species once thought asexual have revealed evidence for sexual for parasitic protozoa the genus leishmania have recently been shown have sexual also evidence now indicates that that were previously regarded are anciently sexual and that the majority present day asexual groups likely arose recently and extant protists usually reproduce asexually under favorable but tend reproduce sexually under stressful such nutritional limitation and heat shock important factor the induction sex some protists appears oxidative stress and the production reactive oxygen species leading dna classification wikispecies eukaryota opisthokonta archaeplastida antiquity the two clades animals and plants were they were given the taxonomic rank kingdom linnaeus though included the fungi with plants with some was later realized that they are quite distinct and warrant separate the composition which was not entirely clear until the the various cell eukaryotes were originally placed with plants animals when they became the german biologist georg goldfuss coined the word protozoa refer organisms such ciliates and this group was expanded until encompassed all celled and given their own the protista ernst haeckel the eukaryotes thus came composed four kingdom protista kingdom plantae kingdom fungi kingdom animalia the protists were understood primitive and thus evolutionary grade united their primitive unicellular the disentanglement the deep splits the tree life only really got going with dna sequencing leading system domains rather than kingdoms top level rank being put forward carl woese uniting all the eukaryote kingdoms under the eukaryote the same work the protist tree and still actively going several alternative classifications have been though there consensus the classification produced for the international society protistologists which reflected the consensus the divided the eukaryotes into six supposedly monophyletic although the published classification deliberately did not use formal taxonomic other sources have treated each the six separate excavata flagellate amoebozoa amoeboids slime moulds opisthokonta animals fungi choanoflagellates rhizaria foraminifera radiolaria amoeboid chromalveolata stramenopiles haptophyta cryptophyta alveolata archaeplastida land plants green algae red algae glaucophytes the same year doubts were expressed whether some these supergroups were monophyletic particularly the chromalveolata and review noted the lack evidence for several the supposed six phylogeny the rrna trees constructed during the and left most eukaryotes unresolved crown group not technically true crown which was usually divided the form the mitochondrial see crown eukaryotes the few groups that lack mitochondria branched and the absence was believed but this now considered artifact long branch attraction and they are known have lost them there widespread agreement that the rhizaria belong with the stramenopiles and the clade dubbed the sar supergroup that rhizara not one the main eukaryote also that the amoebozoa and opisthokonta are each monophyletic and form often called the unikonts beyond there does not appear has been estimated that there may distinct lineages most these lineages are the known eukaryote genome sizes vary from megabases babesia bovis the dinoflagellate prorocentrum micans suggesting that the genome the ancestral eukaryote has undergone considerable variation during its the last common ancestor all eukaryotes believed have been phagotrophic protist with least one centriole and cilium facultatively aerobic sex meiosis and syngamy dormant cyst with cell wall chitin and cellulose and peroxisomes later endosymbiosis led the spread plastids some chromalveolata rhizaria some analyses disassemble the chromalveolata rhizaria showing close relationships with the for burki produced tree the form shown eukaryotes sar stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria archaeplastida hacrobia haptophyta cryptophyta amoebozoa opisthokonta excavata bikonts and unikonts another the hacrobia are shown nested inside the which together form clade with most the before joining the sar clade alveolata and together all these groups make the bikonts the amoebozoa and opisthokonta forming the unikonts eukaryotes bikonts archaeplastida hacrobia excavata except preaxostyla preaxostyla formerly excavate sar stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria unikonts amoebozoa opisthokonta the division the eukaryotes into two primary unikonts and derived from ancestral uniflagellar organism and ancestral biflagellar respectively had been suggested study produced somewhat similar although noting that the terms unikonts and bikonts were not used the original eukaryotes bikonts excavata archaeplastida hacrobia sar stramenopiles alveolata rhizaria unikonts opisthokonta amoebozoa expanded chromalveolata other analyses place the sar supergroup within expanded although they differ the placement the resulting five rogozin produced the tree shown where the primary division between the archaeplastida and all other eukaryotes archaeplastida excavata position chromalveolata including unikonts amoebozoa opisthokonta more the expanded chromalveolata shown more closely related the producing tree the form shown eukaryotes excavata chromalveolata including archaeplastida unikonts amoebozoa opisthokonta alternative views paper published which examined the data used some the analyses presented above well performing new strongly suggested that the archaeplastida are the phylogeny finally proposed the paper shown eukaryotes amoebozoa opisthokonta excavata red algae glaucophyta chromalveolata including green plants there are also smaller groups eukaryotes including the genus collodictyon the telonemids and biliphytes whose position uncertain seems fall outside the major overall seems although progress has been there are still very significant uncertainties the evolutionary history and classification roger simpson said with the current pace change our understanding the eukaryote tree should proceed with there are also the cladistic analyses diana lipscomb based classical data which have red algae basal and archeoplastida the survey parfrey recovered only the molecular analyses that include that out not recovered goloboff combined and mostly weakly supported other molecular analyses laura parfrey point out that archeoplastida support comes primarily from phylogenomic analyses and these may picking misleading endosymbiotic gene transfer signal genes independently transferred from the plastid the host nucleus the archeoplastid and stiller and harrell emphasize that the group can explained branch and subtle and easily overlooked biases can dominate the overall results molecular phylogenetic analyses ancient eukaryotic sources potential phylogenetic artifact should investigated not just when obvious branch red algae basal also supported molecular cyanidioschyzon red considered basal sister group the rest nagashima and has the most primitive only mitochondrion vacuoles trienoic and the smallest eukaryotic genome mbp rhizaria are only moderately supported the statistical support for them inconsistent multigene genealogies with larger taxon sampling and the group ambiguously supported goloboff origin eukaryotes eocyte hypothesis phylogenetic tree archaea bacteria the origin the eukaryotic cell considered milestone the evolution since eukaryotes include all complex cells and almost all multicellular the timing this series events hard knoll suggests they developed approximately billion years some acritarchs are known from least billion years and the possible alga grypania has been found far back billion years organized living structures have been found the black shales the palaeoproterozoic francevillian formation dated billion years eukaryotic life could have evolved that fossils that are clearly related modern groups start appearing estimated billion years the form red alga though recent work suggests the existence fossilized filamentous algae the vindhya basin dating back perhaps billion years biomarkers suggest that least stem eukaryotes arose even the presence steranes australian shales indicates that eukaryotes were present these rocks dated billion years relationship archaea eukaryotes are more closely related archaea than bacteria least terms nuclear dna and genetic and one controversial idea place them with archaea the clade neomura however other such membrane eukaryotes are similar three main explanations for this have been eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion two more wherein the cytoplasm formed from eubacterium and the nucleus from from virus from pre cell eukaryotes developed from and acquired their eubacterial characteristics from the eukaryotes and archaea developed separately from modified the chronocyte hypothesis for the origin the eukaryotic cell postulates that primitive eukaryotic cell was formed the endosymbiosis both archaea and bacteria third type termed endomembrane system and mitochondria the origins the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also the phagotrophic hypothesis proposes that type membranes lacking cell wall originated with the development whereas mitochondria were acquired ingestion the syntrophic hypothesis proposes that the eukaryote relied the mitochondrion for and ultimately grew surround here the membranes originated after the engulfment the part thanks mitochondrial genes the hydrogen hypothesis one particular study using genomes construct supertrees pisani suggest along with evidence that there was never less eukaryotes evolved from syntrophy between archaea closely related thermoplasmatales and proteobacterium likely symbiosis driven sulfur the mitochondrion and its genome remnant the proteobacterial hypotheses for the origin eukaryotes different hypotheses have been proposed how eukaryotic cells came into these hypotheses can classified into two distinct classes autogenous models and chimeric autogenous models autogenous models propose that eukaryotic cell containing nucleus existed and later acquired mitochondria according this large prokaryote developed invaginations its plasma membrane order obtain enough surface area service its cytoplasmic volume the invaginations differentiated some became separate giving rise the endomembrane system including the endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus nuclear membrane and single membrane structures such lysosomes mitochondria are proposed come from the endosymbiosis aerobic proteobacterium and assumed that all the eukaryotic lineages that did not acquire mitochondria went chloroplasts came about from another endosymbiotic event involving cyanobacteria since all eukaryotes have but not all have mitochondria are thought have come this the serial endosymbiosis theory some models propose that the origins double layered organelles such mitochondria and chloroplasts the eukaryotic cell due the compartmentalization dna vesicles that were formed from the secondary invaginations more detailed infoldings cellular citation needed chimeric models chimeric models claim that two prokaryotic cells existed initially archaeon and bacterium these cells underwent merging either physical fusion endosymbiosis thereby leading the formation eukaryotic within these chimeric some studies further claim that mitochondria originated from bacterial ancestor while others emphasize the role endosymbiotic processes behind the origin based the process mutualistic symbiosis the hypotheses can categorized the serial endosymbiotic theory the hydrogen hypothesis mostly process symbiosis where hydrogen transfer takes place among different and the syntrophy according serial endosymbiotic union between motile anaerobic bacterium like spirochaeta and thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon like thermoplasma which sulfidogenic gave rise the present day this union established motile organism capable living the already existing acidic and sulfurous oxygen known cause toxicity organisms that lack the required metabolic machinery thus the archaeon provided the bacterium with highly beneficial reduced environment sulfur and sulfate were reduced microaerophilic oxygen was reduced water thereby creating mutual benefit the bacterium the other contributed the necessary fermentation products and electron acceptors along with its motility feature the archaeon thereby gaining swimming motility for the from consortium bacterial and archaeal dna originated the nuclear genome eukaryotic spirochetes gave rise the motile features eukaryotic endosymbiotic unifications the ancestors proteobacteria and led the origin mitochondria and plastids respectively for thiodendron has been known have originated via ectosymbiotic process based similar syntrophy sulfur existing between the two types bacteria desulphobacter and spirochaeta however such association based motile symbiosis have never been observed also there evidence archaeans and spirochetes adapting intense based the hydrogen the symbiotic linkage anaerobic and autotrophic methanogenic archaeon with proteobacterium the gave rise the the host utilized hydrogen and carbon dioxide produce methane while the capable aerobic expelled and byproducts anaerobic fermentation the methanogenic environment worked sink for which resulted heightened bacterial endosymbiotic gene transfer acted catalyst for the host acquire the carbohydrate metabolism and turn heterotrophic subsequently the methane forming capability was thus the origins the heterotrophic organelle are identical the origins the eukaryotic lineage this the presence represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out the syntrophy hypothesis was developed contrast the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence two symbiotic according this eukaryogenesis origin eukaryotic occurred based metabolic symbiosis between methanogenic archaeon and this syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated transfer between different species under anaerobic earlier proteobacterium became member this and later developed into the gene transfer from proteobacterium archaeon led the methanogenic archaeon developing into the archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus while the proteobacterium contributed towards the cytoplasmic features this theory incorporates two selective forces that were needed considered during the time nucleus evolution presence metabolic partitioning order avoid the harmful effects the existence anabolic and catabolic cellular and prevention abnormal biosynthesis proteins that occur due vast spread introns the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and the loss methanogenesis thus the origin eukaryotes endosymbiotic processes has been broadly recognized and accepted mitochondria and plastids have been known originate from bacterial ancestor during parallel adaptation however there still remains greater need assessing the question how much eukaryotic complexity being originated via implementation these symbiogenetic theories see also evolution
