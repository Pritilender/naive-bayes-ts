evolution sexual reproduction described several competing scientific all sexually reproducing eukaryotic organisms derive from common ancestor which was single celled eukaryotic species many protists reproduce sexually multicellular plants animals and fungi there are few species which have secondarily lost this such bdelloidea and some parthenocarpic plants the evolution sex contains two yet themes its origin and its maintenance however since the hypotheses for the origins sex are difficult test most current work has been focused the maintenance sexual seems that sexual cycle maintained because improves the quality progeny fitness despite reducing the overall number offspring the fold cost sex order for sex evolutionarily must associated with significant increase the fitness one the most widely accepted explanations for the advantage sex lies the creation genetic another explanation based two molecular the first these the advantage recombinational dna repair promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair that while the second the advantage complementation also known hybrid heterosis masking for the advantage due genetic there are three possible reasons this might first sexual reproduction can combine the effects two beneficial mutations the same individual sex aids the spread advantageous also the necessary mutations not have have occurred one after another single line unreliable second sex acts bring together currently deleterious mutations create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population sex aids the removal deleterious however organisms containing only one set deleterious mutations would eliminated and therefore removal harmful mutations unlikely benefit for sexual lastly sex creates new gene combinations that may more fit than previously existing may simply lead reduced competition among for the advantage due dna there immediate large benefit removing dna damage recombinational dna repair during meiosis since this removal allows greater survival progeny with undamaged the advantage complementation each sexual partner avoidance the bad effects their deleterious recessive genes progeny the masking effect normal dominant genes contributed the other the classes hypotheses based the creation variation are further broken down important realise that any number these hypotheses may true any given species they are not mutually exclusive and that different hypotheses may apply different however research framework based creation variation has yet found that allows one determine whether the reason for sex universal for all sexual and which mechanisms are acting each the other the maintenance sex based dna repair and complementation applies widely all sexual contents historical perspective questions two fold cost sex promotion genetic variation spread advantageous traits novel genotypes increased resistance parasites deleterious mutation clearance maintenance free individuals removal deleterious genes other explanations speed evolution dna repair and complementation libertine bubble theory origin sexual reproduction mechanistic origin sexual reproduction viral eukaryogenesis neomuran revolution see also references further reading external links historical perspective modern scientific thinking the problem can traced back erasmus darwin the also features aristotle the thread was later picked august weismann who argued that the purpose sex was generate genetic variation detailed the majority the explanations the other charles darwin concluded that the effects hybrid vigor amply sufficient account for the genesis the two this consistent with the repair and complementation given below under other several explanations have been suggested biologists including hamilton alexey kondrashov george williams harris carol michael cox frederic hopf and richard michod explain how sexual reproduction maintained vast array different living questions some questions biologists have attempted answer why sexual reproduction many organisms has cost tness relation asexual did mating types types according their arise result anisogamy gamete did mating types evolve before why most sexual organisms use binary mating system why some organisms have gamete two fold cost sex twofold cost sex most multicellular sexual the population consists two only one which capable bearing young with the exception simultaneous hermaphrodites asexual each member the population capable bearing this implies that asexual population has intrinsic capacity grow more rapidly with each the cost was first described mathematical terms john maynard smith imagined asexual mutant arising sexual half which comprises males that cannot themselves produce with only the asexual lineage doubles its representation the population each all else being technically this not problem sex but problem some multicellular sexually reproducing there are numerous isogamous species which are sexual and not have the problem producing individuals which cannot directly replicate the principal costs sex that males and females must search for each other order and sexual selection often favours traits that reduce the survival evidence that the cost not insurmountable comes from george williams who noted the existence species which are capable both asexual and sexual reproduction these species time their sexual reproduction with periods environmental and reproduce asexually when conditions are more the important point that these species are observed reproduce sexually when they could choose not implying that there selective advantage sexual widely believed that disadvantage sexual reproduction that sexually reproducing organism will only able pass its genes each this consequence the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are this however conflates sex and reproduction which are two separate the fold cost may more accurately described the cost anisogamy not all sexual organisms are there are numerous species which are sexual and not have this problem because they not produce males yeast for are isogamous sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages their life cycle and have chance passing their genes into their the fold cost sex may compensated for some species many females may eat males after males may much smaller males may help raise some species avoid the cost sexual although they have sex the sense genetic recombination these species bacteria and ciliates sex and reproduction occurs promotion genetic variation august weismann proposed explanation for the evolution where the advantage sex the creation variation among was then subsequently explained genetics terms fisher and muller and has been recently summarised burt george williams gave example based around the elm tree the forest this empty patches between trees can support one individual when patch becomes available because the death other seeds will compete fill the since the chance success occupying the patch depends upon its and parent cannot anticipate which genotype most each parent will send many creating competition between natural selection therefore favours parents which can produce variety offspring see lottery principle similar hypothesis named the tangled bank hypothesis after passage charles the origin species the proposed michael ghiselin his book the economy nature and the evolution sex suggests that diverse set siblings may able extract more food from its environment than clone because each sibling uses slightly different one the main proponents this hypothesis graham bell mcgill university the hypothesis has been criticised for failing explain how asexual species developed his evolution and human behavior mit john cartwright contrast the view that sex promotes genetic heng and gorelick and heng reviewed evidence that sex actually acts constraint genetic they consider that sex acts coarse weeding out major genetic such chromosomal but permitting minor such changes the nucleotide gene level that are often pass through the sexual spread advantageous traits novel genotypes clonal interference sex could method which novel genotypes are because sex combines genes from two sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual sexual two different advantageous alleles arise different loci chromosome different members the chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can produced within few generations recombination however should the same two alleles arise different members asexual the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele independently gain the same which would take much several studies have addressed whether this model sufficiently robust explain the predominance sexual versus asexual these including arguments for and against the were summarized birdsell and wills ronald fisher also suggested that sex might facilitate the spread advantageous genes allowing them escape their genetic they should arise chromosome with deleterious supporters these theories respond the balance argument that the individuals produced sexual and asexual reproduction may differ other respects too which may influence the persistence for water fleas the genus cladocera sexual offspring form eggs which are better able survive the increased resistance parasites one the most widely discussed theories explain the persistence sex that maintained assist sexual individuals resisting parasites also known the red hypothesis and birdsell and wills when environment previously neutral deleterious alleles can become the environment changed sufficiently rapidly between these changes the environment can make sex advantageous for the such rapid changes environment are caused the evolution between hosts and imagine for example that there one gene parasites with two alleles and conferring two types parasitic and one gene hosts with two alleles and conferring two types parasite such that parasites with allele can attach themselves hosts with the allele and such situation will lead cyclic changes allele frequency increases will there will several genes involved the relationship between hosts and asexual population offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance mutation sexual population however offspring will have new combination parasitic resistance other like lewis carroll red sexual hosts are continually adapting order stay ahead their evidence for this explanation for the evolution sex provided comparison the rate molecular evolution genes for kinases and immunoglobulins the immune system with genes coding other proteins the genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably further evidence for the red queen hypothesis were provided observing term dynamics and parasite coevolution mixed sexual and population snails potamopyrgus antipodarum the number the number and the rates parasite infection for both were was found that clones that were plentiful the beginning the study became more susceptible parasites over parasite infections the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically some clonal types disappeared meanwhile sexual snail populations remained much more stable over however hanley studied mite infestations parthenogenetic gecko species and its two related sexual ancestral contrary expectation based the red queen hypothesis they found that the abundance and mean intensity mites sexual geckos was significantly higher than asexuals sharing the same researchers used the microscopic roundworm caenorhabditis elegans host and the pathogenic bacteria serratia marcescens generate parasite coevolutionary system controlled allowing them conduct more than evolution experiments testing the red queen they genetically manipulated the mating system elegans causing populations mate either mixture both within the same then they exposed those populations the marcescens parasite was found that the fertilizing populations elegans were rapidly driven extinct the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations keep pace with their result consistent with the red queen critics the red queen hypothesis question whether the constantly changing environment hosts and parasites sufficiently common explain the evolution otto and nuismer presented results showing that species interactions host parasite typically select against they concluded although the red queen hypothesis favors sex under certain alone does not account for the ubiquity otto and gerstein further stated that seems doubtful that strong selection per gene sufficiently commonplace for the red queen hypothesis explain the ubiquity parker reviewed numerous genetic studies plant disease resistance and failed uncover single example consistent with the assumptions the red queen deleterious mutation clearance mutations can have many different effects upon generally believed that the majority neutral mutations are which means that they will cause decrease the overall mutation has deleterious will then usually removed from the population the process natural selection sexual reproduction believed more efficient than asexual reproduction removing those mutations from the there are two main hypotheses which explain how sex may act remove deleterious genes from the maintenance free individuals muller ratchet finite asexual population under the pressure deleterious the random loss individuals without such mutations this known muller ratchet sexual however mutation free genotypes can restored recombination genotypes containing deleterious this comparison will only work for small population large random loss the most fit genotype becomes unlikely even asexual see birdsell and wills for review this removal deleterious genes synergistic epistasis this hypothesis was proposed alexey kondrashov and sometimes known the deterministic mutation hypothesis assumes that the majority deleterious mutations are only slightly and affect the individual such that the introduction each additional mutation has increasingly large effect the fitness the this relationship between number mutations and fitness known synergistic epistasis way analogy think car with several minor each not sufficient alone prevent the car from but the faults combine prevent the car from similarly organism may able cope with few but the presence many mutations could overwhelm its backup kondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature mutations means that the population will tend composed individuals with small number sex will act recombine these creating some individuals with fewer deleterious and some with because there major selective disadvantage individuals with more these individuals die sex compartmentalises the deleterious there has been much criticism since relies two key restrictive the first requires that the rate deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation order provide substantial advantage for while there some empirical evidence for for example drosophila and coli there also strong evidence against thus for for the sexual species saccharomyces cerevisiae and neurospora crassa the mutation rate per genome per replication are and respectively for the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation secondly there should strong interactions among loci synergistic fitness relation for which there only limited conversely there also the same amount evidence that mutations show epistasis purely additive antagonistic interactions each additional mutation has disproportionally small effect other explanations speed evolution ilan eshel suggested that sex prevents rapid suggests that recombination breaks favourable gene combinations more often than creates and sex maintained because ensures selection term than asexual populations the population less affected term see eshel and feldman and reviewed birdsell and wills this explanation not widely its assumptions are very has recently been shown experiments with chlamydomonas algae that sex can remove the speed limit clarification needed dna repair and complementation discussed the earlier part this sexual reproduction conventionally explained adaptation for producing genetic variation through allelic acknowledged however serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists conclude that the benefit sex major unsolved problem evolutionary alternative informational approach this problem has led the view that the two fundamental aspects genetic recombination and outcrossing are adaptive responses the two major sources noise transmitting genetic genetic noise can occur either physical damage the genome chemically altered bases dna breaks the replication errors this alternative view referred the repair and complementation distinguish from the traditional variation the repair and complementation hypothesis assumes that genetic recombination fundamentally dna repair and that when occurs during meiosis adaptation for repairing the genomic dna which passed recombinational repair the only repair process known which can accurately remove strand damages and such damages are both common nature and ordinarily lethal not for double strand breaks dna occur about times per cell cycle human cells see dna damage naturally recombinational repair prevalent from the simplest viruses the most complex multicellular effective against many different types genomic and particular highly efficient overcoming strand studies the mechanism meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis adaptation for repairing these considerations form the basis for the first part the repair and complementation some lines descent from the earliest the diploid stage the sexual which was first became the predominant because allowed complementation the masking deleterious recessive mutations hybrid vigor heterosis outcrossing the second fundamental aspect maintained the advantage masking mutations and the disadvantage inbreeding mating with close which allows expression recessive mutations commonly observed inbreeding depression this accord with charles darwin who concluded that the adaptive advantage sex hybrid put the offspring two especially their progenitors have been subjected very different have great advantage weight constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one the same however outcrossing may abandoned favor parthogenesis selfing which retain the advantage meiotic recombinational under conditions which the costs mating are very for costs mating are high when individuals are rare geographic such when there has been forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones such times mates are hard and this favors parthenogenic the view the repair and complementation the removal dna damage recombinational repair produces less deleterious form informational allelic this lesser informational noise generates genetic viewed some the major effect discussed the earlier parts this libertine bubble theory the evolution sex can alternatively described kind gene exchange that independent from according the thierry libertine bubble sex originated from archaic gene transfer process among prebiotic the contact among the biotic bubbles through simple food parasitic promote the transfer genetic material from one bubble that interactions between two organisms balance appear sufficient condition make these interactions evolutionarily select bubbles that tolerate these interactions bubbles through blind evolutionary process reinforcing gene correlations and the libertine bubble proposes that meiotic sex evolved eukaryotes solve problem that bacteria did not namely large amount dna occurring archaic step cell formation and genetic rather than providing selective advantages through sex could thought series separate events which combines step some very weak benefits meiosis gametogenesis and therefore current sexual species could descendants primitive organisms that practiced more stable exchanges the long while asexual species have much more recently evolutionary from the conflict interest resulting from origin sexual reproduction the eukaryotic fossil sexual reproduction first appeared million years ago the proterozoic eon all sexually reproducing eukaryotic organisms derive from common ancestor which was single celled many protists reproduce the multicellular plants animals and fungi there are few species which have secondarily lost this such bdelloidea and some parthenocarpic plants organisms need replicate their genetic material efficient and reliable the necessity repair genetic damage one the leading theories explaining the origin sexual diploid individuals can repair damaged section their dna via homologous recombination since there are two copies the gene the cell and one copy presumed mutation haploid individual the other more likely become the dna repair machinery has way knowing what the original undamaged sequence the most primitive form sex may have been one organism with damaged dna replicating undamaged strand from similar organism order repair evidence sexual reproduction arose very early eukaryotic the essential features meiosis may have already been present the prokaryotic ancestors extant proteins with central functions meiosis are similar key proteins bacterial for reca that catalyses the key functions dna homology search and strand exchange the bacterial sexual process has orthologs eukaryotes that perform similar functions meiotic recombination see wikipedia articles reca rad and dmc both bacterial transformation and meiosis eukaryotic microorganisms are induced stressful circumstances such resource depletion and dna damaging this suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with particularly stress that causes dna these stresses induce altered physiologic termed that allows active dna from donor bacterium and the integration this dna into the recipient genome see natural competence allowing recombinational repair the damaged environmental stresses leading dna damage were persistent challenge the survival early then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote eukaryote and adaptative adjustments would have followed course which bacterial transformation naturally gave rise sexual reproduction sex may also have been present even the rna world that considered have preceded dna cellular life proposal for the origin sex the rna world was based the type sexual interaction that known occur extant stranded segmented rna viruses such influenza and extant stranded segmented rna viruses such exposure conditions that cause rna damage could have led blockage replication and death these early rna life sex would have allowed assortment segments between two individuals with damaged permitting undamaged combinations rna segments come thus allowing such regeneration known multiplicity occurs influenza virus and reovirus another theory that sexual reproduction originated from selfish parasitic genetic elements that exchange genetic material that copies their own for their transmission and some sexual reproduction has been shown enhance the spread parasitic genetic elements yeast filamentous bacterial conjugation form genetic exchange that some sources describe not form but rather example horizontal gene transfer however does support the selfish genetic element propagated through such selfish the plasmid similarly has been proposed that sexual reproduction evolved from ancient haloarchaea through combination jumping genes and swapping plasmids third theory that sex evolved form cannibalism one primitive organism ate another but rather than completely digesting some the organism dna was incorporated into the organism sex may also derived from another prokaryotic comprehensive origin sex theory proposes that eukaryan syngamy fusion arose from prokaryan unilateral infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection more virulent sex meiosis fission then evolved host strategy uncouple and thereby the acquired symbiont mechanistic origin sexual reproduction though theories positing benefits that lead the origin sex are often several additional theories the evolution the mechanisms sexual reproduction have been viral eukaryogenesis the viral eukaryogenesis theory proposes that eukaryotic cells arose from combination lysogenic virus archaeon and bacterium this model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaeon and the bacterium and took over the role information storage for the the archaeal host transferred much its functional genome the virus during the evolution cytoplasm but retained the function gene translation and general the bacterium transferred most its functional genome the virus transitioned into for these transformations lead the eukaryotic cell the hypothesis specifies like virus the lysogenic like virus likely ancestor because its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic these include double stranded dna linear chromosome with short telomeric repeats complex membrane bound the ability produce capped and the ability export the capped mrna across the viral membrane into the cytoplasm the presence lysogenic like virus ancestor explains the development meiotic essential component sexual meiotic division the hypothesis arose because the evolutionary pressures placed the lysogenic virus result its inability enter into the lytic cycle this selective pressure resulted the development processes allowing the viruses spread horizontally throughout the the outcome this selection was cell this distinct from the conjugation methods used bacterial plasmids under evolutionary with important the possibility this kind fusion supported the presence fusion proteins the envelopes the pox viruses that allow them fuse with host these proteins could have been transferred the cell membrane during viral enabling cell fusion between the virus host and uninfected the theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other after the fusion the two incompatibilities between the two viruses result like cell the two viruses established the cell would initiate replication response signals from the host like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes which point linear chromosomes would bound together with the homologous nature the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping both sets into speculated that this grouping may the origin crossing characteristic the first division modern the partitioning apparatus the like cell cycle the cells used replicate independently would then pull each set chromosomes one side the still bound these centromeres would prevent their replication subsequent resulting four daughter cells with one copy one the two original like the process resulting from combination two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics neomuran revolution alternative proposed thomas smith was labeled the neomuran revolution the designation neomuran refers the appearances the common ancestors eukaryotes and cavalier smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged million years other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much but smith dismisses these claims because they are based the theoretically and unsound model molecular clocks cavalier theory the neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history the cellular machinery for recombination and suggests that this machinery evolved two distinct bouts separated long period first the appearance recombination machinery bacterial ancestor which was maintained for clarification needed until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted the presence nucleosomes the archaeal products the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial they introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life cavalier smith argues that both bouts mechanical evolution were motivated similar selective the need for accurate dna replication without loss see also book sex asexual reproduction biological reproduction epistasis
