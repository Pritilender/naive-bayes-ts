synthesis the and was not until the and however that significant number universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology their often conjunction with ecology and the united states result the rapid growth molecular and cell biology many universities have split their biology departments into molecular and cell biology style departments and ecology and evolutionary biology style departments which often have subsumed older departments botany zoology and the the subdiscipline paleontology often found earth science geoscience microbiology has recently developed into evolutionary was originally ignored due the paucity morphological traits and the lack species concept now evolutionary researchers are taking advantage our extensive understanding microbial the ease microbial genomics and the quick generation time some microbes answer evolutionary similar features have led progress viral evolution particularly for bacteriophages important evolutionary biologists evolutionary biologists many biologists have contributed our current understanding although the term had been used sporadically starting the turn the evolutionary biology disciplinary sense gained currency during the period the evolutionary theodosius dobzhansky and ford were important the establishment empirical research programme for evolutionary biology were theorists fisher sewall wright and haldane ernst mayr george gaylord simpson and ledyard stebbins were also important builders during the modern the fields systematics paleontology and botany respectively through training many future evolutionary james crow richard lewontin dan hartl marcus feldman and brian charlesworth have also made large contributions building the discipline evolutionary journals some scientific journals specialize exclusively evolutionary biology including the journals evolution journal evolutionary biology and bmc evolutionary biology some journals cover specialties within evolutionary such the journals systematic biology molecular biology and evolution and its sister journal genome biology and evolution and cladistics other journals combine aspects evolutionary biology with other related for molecular ecology proceedings the royal society london series the american naturalist and theoretical population biology have overlap with ecology and other aspects organismal overlap with ecology also prominent the review journals trends ecology and evolution and annual review evolution and systematics the journals genetics and plos genetics overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary current research topics tree life the project current research evolutionary biology covers diverse should expected given the centrality evolution understanding modern evolutionary biology incorporates ideas from diverse areas such molecular genetics and even computer science first some fields evolutionary research try explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for the work the modern evolutionary synthesis these phenomena include speciation the evolution sexual reproduction the evolution cooperation the evolution ageing and evolvability second biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary what happened and this includes fields such paleobiology well systematics and phylogenetics third the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised time when nobody understood the molecular basis today evolutionary biologists try determine the genetic architecture interesting evolutionary phenomena such adaptation and speciation they seek answers questions such how many genes are how large are the effects each what extent are the effects different genes what sort function the genes involved tend and what sort changes tend happen them point mutations gene duplication even genome duplication evolutionary biologists try reconcile the high heritability seen twin studies with the difficulty finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome wide association studies one challenge studying genetic architecture that the classical population genetics that catalyzed the modern evolutionary synthesis must updated take into account modern molecular this requires great deal mathematical development relate dna sequence data evolutionary theory part theory molecular evolution for biologists try infer which genes have been under strong selection detecting selective sweeps fourth the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute but not about their relative current research seeks determine evolutionary forces include natural selection sexual selection genetic drift genetic draft developmental mutation bias and biogeography evolutionary approach also key much current research biology that does not set out study evolution per especially organismal biology and ecology for evolutionary thinking key life history theory annotation genes and their function relies heavily evolutionary approaches the field evo devo investigates how developmental processes work using the comparative method determine how they
