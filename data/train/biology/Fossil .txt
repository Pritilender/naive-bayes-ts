process fossilization varies according tissue type and external permineralization permineralization process fossilization that occurs when organism the empty spaces within organism spaces filled with liquid gas during become filled with rich minerals precipitate from the occupying the empty this process can occur very small such within the cell wall plant cell small scale permineralization can produce very detailed for permineralization the organism must become covered sediment soon after death soon after the initial decay the degree which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details the some fossils consist only skeletal remains other fossils contain traces skin feathers even soft this form diagenesis casts and molds some cases the original remains the organism completely dissolve are otherwise the remaining shaped hole the rock called external mold this hole later filled with other cast endocast internal mold formed when sediments minerals fill the internal cavity such the inside bivalve snail the hollow skull authigenic mineralisation this special form cast and mold the chemistry the organism fragment can act nucleus for the precipitation minerals such resulting nodule forming around this happens rapidly before significant decay the organic very fine dimensional morphological detail can nodules from the carboniferous mazon creek fossil beds usa are among the best documented examples such replacement and recrystallization replacement occurs when the bone other tissue replaced with another some cases mineral replacement the original shell occurs gradually and such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss original shell said recrystallized when the original skeletal compounds are still present but different crystal from aragonite calcite adpression compression fossils such those fossil are the result chemical reduction the complex organic molecules composing the this case the fossil consists original albeit geochemically altered this chemical change expression diagenesis often what remains carbonaceous film known which case the fossil known often however the phytoleim lost and all that remains impression the organism the impression many however compressions and impressions occur for when the rock broken the phytoleim will often attached one part whereas the counterpart will just for this one term covers the two modes adpression carbon films carbonaceous films are thin coatings which consist predominantly the chemical element carbon the soft tissues organisms are made largely organic carbon compounds and during diagenesis under reducing conditions only thin film carbon residue left which forms silhouette the original bioimmuration bioimmuration occurs when skeletal organism overgrows otherwise subsumes another preserving the impression within the usually sessile skeletal such bryozoan oyster which grows along substrate covering other sessile sclerobionts

seeks map out how life evolved across geologic substantial hurdle the difficulty working out fossil beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating this technique our only means giving rocks greater than about million years old absolute and can accurate within although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory its basic principle the rates which various radioactive elements decay are and the ratio the radioactive element its decay products shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the radioactive elements are common only rocks with volcanic and the only bearing rocks that can dated radiometrically are volcanic ash stratigraphy palaeontologists rely stratigraphy date stratigraphy the science deciphering the that the sedimentary record rocks normally form relatively horizontal with each layer younger than the one underneath fossil found between two layers whose ages are the age claimed lie between the two known because rock sequences are not but may broken faults periods erosion very difficult match rock beds that are not directly however fossils species that survived for relatively short time can used match isolated this technique called biostratigraphy for the conodont eoplacognathus pseudoplanus has short range the middle ordovician rocks unknown age have traces pseudoplanus they have ordovician such index fossils must globally distributed and occupy short time range misleading results are produced the index fossils are incorrectly stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can general provide only relative dating was before which often sufficient for studying however this difficult for some time because the problems involved matching rocks the same age across continents family tree relationships also help narrow down the date when lineages first for fossils date million years ago and the calculated family says was ancestor and then must have evolved also possible estimate how long ago two living clades approximately how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived assuming that dna mutations accumulate constant these molecular clocks however are and provide only approximate for they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature the cambrian explosion first and estimates produced different techniques may vary factor limitations biostratigraphy organisms are only rarely preserved fossils the best and only fraction such fossils have been this illustrated the fact that the number species known through the fossil record less than the number known living suggesting that the number species known through fossils must far less than all the species that have ever because the specialized and rare circumstances required for biological structure only small percentage forms can expected represented and each discovery represents only snapshot the process the transition itself can only illustrated and

stromatolites are major constituent the fossil record for first billion peaking about billion years they subsequently declined abundance and which the start the cambrian had fallen their the most widely supported explanation that stromatolite builders fell victims grazing creatures the cambrian substrate revolution implying that sufficiently complex organisms were common over billion years the connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance well documented the younger ordovician evolutionary radiation stromatolite abundance also increased after the end ordovician and end permian extinctions decimated marine falling back earlier levels marine animals fluctuations metazoan population and diversity may not have been the only factor the reduction stromatolite factors such the chemistry the environment may have been responsible for while prokaryotic cyanobacteria themselves reproduce asexually through cell they were instrumental priming the environment for the evolutionary
