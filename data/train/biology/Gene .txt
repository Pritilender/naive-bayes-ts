biology	gene genes navigation search introduction genetics gene double helix dna chromosome introns eukaryote splicing exons protein gene the molecular unit heredity living organism used extensively the scientific community name given some stretches deoxyribonucleic acids and ribonucleic acids that code for polypeptide for rna chain that has function the living beings depend they specify all proteins and functional rna genes hold the information build and maintain cells and pass genetic traits all organisms have genes corresponding various biological some which are instantly such eye color number and some which are such blood type increased risk for specific the thousands basic biochemical processes that comprise life the word gene derived from the greek word genesis meaning birth genos meaning origin see pangenesis dna double helix modern working definition gene locatable region genomic sequence corresponding unit which associated with regulatory transcribed and other functional sequence regions colloquial usage the term gene good hair color may actually refer allele gene the basic sequence nucleic acids dna the case certain viruses rna while allele one variant that thus when the mainstream press refers having gene for specific this customarily most all people would have gene for the trait although certain people will have specific allele that which results the trait further genes code for which might result identifiable but the gene genotype not the trait phenotype which big genes are class genes whose nuclear transcript spans base more chromosomal dna

gene gene targeting and implications changing concept see also notes and references bibliography external links physical definitions rna genes and genomes the world when proteins are the gene first copied into rna intermediate other the rna molecules are the actual functional for rnas known ribozymes are capable enzymatic function and microrna has regulatory the dna sequences from which such rnas are transcribed are known rna genes some viruses store their entire genomes the form rna and contain dna because they use rna store their cellular hosts may synthesize their proteins soon they are infected and without the delay waiting for the other rna retroviruses such hiv require the reverse transcription their genome from rna into dna before their proteins can french researchers came across puzzling example mediated inheritance mice with loss function mutation the gene kit have white offspring these mutants can have white tails despite having only normal kit the research team traced this effect back mutated kit while rna common genetic storage material mammals particular rna inheritance has been observed very functional structure gene eukaryotic gene promoters enhancers dna transcribed precursor mrna messenger rna translated protein the vast majority living organisms encode their genes long strands dna deoxyribonucleic dna consists chain made from four types nucleotide subunits each composed carbon sugar deoxyribose phosphate group and one the four bases adenine cytosine guanine and thymine the most common form dna cell double helix structure which two individual dna strands twist around each other handed this the base pairing rules specify that guanine pairs with cytosine and adenine pairs with the base pairing between guanine and cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds whereas the base pairing between adenine and thymine forms two hydrogen the two strands double helix must therefore complementary that their bases must align such that the adenines one strand are paired with the thymines the other and due the chemical composition the pentose residues the dna strands have one end dna polymer contains exposed hydroxyl group the deoxyribose this known the end the the other end contains exposed phosphate group this the end the directionality dna vitally important many cellular since double helices are necessarily directional strand running pairs with complementary strand running and processes such dna replication occur only one all nucleic acid synthesis cell occurs the direction because new monomers are added via dehydration reaction that uses the exposed hydroxyl nucleophile the expression genes encoded dna begins transcribing the gene into rna second type nucleic acid that very similar but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than deoxyribose rna also contains the base uracil place thymine rna molecules are less stable than dna and are typically genes that encode proteins are composed series nucleotide sequences called codons which serve the words the genetic language the genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids the genetic code nearly the same for all known all genes have regulatory regions addition regions that explicitly code for protein rna regulatory region shared almost all genes known the promoter which provides position that recognized the transcription machinery when gene about transcribed and gene can have more than one resulting rnas that differ how far they extend the end although promoter regions have consensus sequence that the most common sequence this some genes have strong promoters that bind the transcription machinery and others have weak promoters that bind these weak promoters usually permit lower rate transcription than the strong because the transcription machinery binds them and initiates transcription less other possible regulatory regions include enhancers which can compensate for weak most regulatory regions are upstream that before toward the end the transcription initiation eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult identify than prokaryotic promoters many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons groups genes whose products have related functions and which are transcribed eukaryotic genes are transcribed only one but may include long stretches dna called introns which are transcribed but never translated into protein they are spliced out before splicing can also occur prokaryotic but less common than chromosomes the total complement genes organism cell known its genome which may stored one more chromosomes the region the chromosome which particular gene located called its locus chromosome consists very long dna helix which thousands genes are prokaryotes bacteria and archaea typically store their genomes single circular sometimes supplemented additional small circles dna called plasmids which usually encode only few genes and are easily transferable between for the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded bacterial plasmids and can passed between individual even those different via horizontal gene transfer although some simple eukaryotes also possess plasmids with small numbers the majority eukaryotic genes are stored multiple linear which are packed within the nucleus complex with storage proteins called histones the manner which dna stored the well chemical modifications the histone are regulatory mechanisms governing whether particular region dna accessible for gene expression the ends eukaryotic chromosomes are capped long stretches repetitive sequences called telomeres which not code for any gene product but are present prevent degradation coding and regulatory regions during dna replication the length the telomeres tends decrease each time the genome replicated preparation for cell the loss telomeres has been proposed explanation for cellular senescence the loss the ability and extension for the aging process whereas the chromosomes prokaryotes are relatively those eukaryotes often contain called junk dna regions dna that serve obvious simple celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts such whereas the genomes complex multicellular organisms including contain absolute majority dna without identified however now appears although coding dna makes barely the human genome about the bases the genome may the term junk may gene expression gene expression all there are two major steps separating coding gene from its first the dna which the gene resides must transcribed from dna messenger rna and second must translated from mrna rna coding genes must still through the first but are not translated into the process producing biologically functional molecule either rna protein called gene expression and the resulting molecule itself called gene product genetic code genetic code the genetic code the set chemical symbols called nucleotides which gene translated into functional each gene consists specific sequence nucleotides encoded the nucleotide being made phosphate molecules and specific base one four adenosine thymine cytosine guanine sometimes rna thymine replaced with some viruses strand correspondence between the basic building blocks genetic and amino the basic building blocks must established for genes successfully translated into functional sets three known codons each correspond specific amino acid three codons are known stop and instead specifying new amino alert the translation machinery that the end the gene has been just specific set bases aug signifies the gene start transcribing known the start there are possible codons four possible nucleotides each three hence possible and only standard amino hence the code redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino the correspondence between codons and amino acids nearly universal among all known living transcription the process genetic transcription produces stranded rna molecule known messenger rna whose nucleotide sequence complementary the dna from which was the dna strand whose sequence matches that the rna known the coding strand and the strand from which the rna was synthesized the template strand transcription performed enzyme called rna polymerase which reads the template strand the direction and synthesizes the rna from initiate the polymerase first recognizes and binds promoter region the thus major mechanism gene regulation the blocking sequestering the promoter either tight binding repressor molecules that physically block the organizing the dna that the promoter region not prokaryotes transcription occurs the cytoplasm for very long translation may begin the end the rna while the end still being eukaryotes transcription necessarily occurs the where the dna the rna molecule produced the polymerase known the primary transcript and must undergo post transcriptional modifications before being exported the cytoplasm for the splicing introns present within the transcribed region modification unique alternative splicing mechanisms can result mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different this major form regulation eukaryotic translation translation the process which mature mrna molecule used template for synthesizing new protein translation carried out ribosomes large complexes rna and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions add new amino acids growing polypeptide chain the formation peptide bonds the genetic code read three nucleotides units called codons via interactions with specialized rna molecules called transfer rna each trna has three unpaired bases known the anticodon that are complementary the codon the trna also covalently attached the amino acid specified the complementary when the trna binds its complementary codon mrna the ribosome ligates its amino acid cargo the new polypeptide which synthesized from amino terminus carboxyl terminus during and after its the new protein must fold its active three dimensional structure before can carry out its cellular dna replication and inheritance the development and reproduction organisms relies cell division the process which single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells this requires first making duplicate copy every gene the genome process called dna replication the copies are made specialized enzymes known dna polymerases which read one strand the helical known the template and synthesize new complementary because the dna double helix held together base pairing the sequence one strand completely specifies the sequence its hence only one strand needs read the enzyme produce faithful the process dna replication semiconservative that the copy the genome inherited each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand after dna replication the cell must physically separate the two copies the genome and divide into two distinct bound prokaryotes bacteria and archaea this usually occurs via relatively simple process called binary fission which each circular genome attaches the cell membrane and separated into the daughter cells the membrane invaginates split the cytoplasm into two bound binary fission extremely fast compared the rates cell division eukaryotes eukaryotic cell division more complex process known the cell cycle dna replication occurs during phase this cycle known phase whereas the process segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during phase many celled eukaryotes such yeast reproduction budding which results asymmetrical portions cytoplasm the two daughter molecular inheritance the duplication and transmission genetic material from one generation cells the next the basis for molecular and the link between the classical and molecular pictures organisms inherit the characteristics their parents because the cells the offspring contain copies the genes their cells asexually reproducing organisms the offspring will genetic copy clone the parent sexually reproducing organisms specialized form cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes germ cells that are haploid contain only one copy each the gametes produced females are called eggs and those produced males are called sperm two gametes fuse form fertilized egg single cell that once again has diploid number each with one copy from the mother and one copy from the during the process meiotic cell event called genetic recombination crossing over can sometimes which length dna one chromatid swapped with length dna the corresponding sister this has effect the alleles the chromatids are the but results reassortment otherwise linked alleles they are the mendelian principle independent assortment asserts that each two genes for each trait will sort independently into which allele organism inherits for one trait unrelated which allele inherits for another this fact only true for genes that not reside the same are located very far from one another the same the closer two genes lie the same the more closely they will associated gametes and the more often they will appear genes that are very close are essentially never separated because extremely unlikely that crossover point will occur between this known genetic linkage history history genetics the notion gene evolving with the science genetics which began when gregor mendel noticed that biological variations are inherited from parent organisms discrete the biological entity responsible for defining traits was later termed gene but the biological basis for inheritance remained unknown until dna was identified the genetic material the prior the dominant theory heredity was one blending inheritance which proposes that the traits the parents blend mix continuous gradient the although work was largely unrecognized after its first publication was rediscovered three european hugo vries carl correns and erich von tschermak who had reached similar conclusions from their own however these scientists were not yet aware the identity the discrete which genetic material the existence genes was first suggested gregor mendel who the studied inheritance peaplants pisum sativum and hypothesized factor that conveys traits from parent spent over years his life one although did not use the term gene explained his results terms inherited mendel was also the first hypothesize independent assortment the distinction between dominant and recessive traits the distinction between heterozygote and homozygote and the difference between what would later described genotype the genetic material and phenotype the visible traits that charles darwin used the term gemmule describe microscopic unit and what would later become known chromosomes had been observed separating out during cell division wilhelm hofmeister early the idea that chromosomes are the carriers inheritance was expressed wilhelm roux darwin also coined the word pangenesis the word pangenesis made from the greek words pan prefix meaning whole encompassing and genesis birth genos origin mendel concept was given name hugo vries his book intracellular pangenesis although probably unaware work the coined the term pangen for the smallest particle one hereditary danish botanist wilhelm johannsen coined the word gene gen danish and describe the fundamental physical and functional units while the related word genetics was first used william bateson derived the word from pangen the early mendel work received renewed attention from thomas hunt morgan showed that genes reside specific chromosomes later showed that genes occupy specific locations the with this morgan and his students began the first chromosomal map the fruit fly drosophila frederick griffith showed that genes could what now known griffith experiment injections into mouse deadly strain bacteria that had been killed transferred genetic information safe strain the same killing the series subsequent discoveries led the realization decades later that chromosomes within cells are the carriers genetic and that they are made dna deoxyribonucleic polymeric molecule found all cells which the discrete mendelian inheritance are george wells beadle and edward lawrie tatum showed that mutations genes caused errors specific steps metabolic pathways this showed that specific genes code for specific leading the one one enzyme hypothesis oswald avery colin munro macleod and maclyn mccarty showed that dna holds the james watson and francis crick demonstrated the molecular structure dna together these discoveries established the central dogma molecular biology which states that proteins are translated from rna which transcribed from this dogma has since been shown have such reverse transcription retroviruses walter fiers and his team the laboratory molecular biology the university ghent ghent belgium were the first determine the sequence the gene for bacteriophage coat richard roberts and phillip sharp discovered that genes can split into this led the idea that one gene can make several recently biological results let the notion gene appear more genes not seem sit side side dna like discrete instead regions the dna producing distinct proteins may that the idea emerges that genes are one long continuum was first hypothesized walter gilbert that neither dna nor protein would required such primitive system that very early stage the earth rna could perform simply catalyst and genetic information storage the modern study genetics the level dna known molecular genetics and the synthesis molecular genetics with traditional darwinian evolution known the modern evolutionary synthesis mendelian inheritance and classical genetics heterozygous mendelian inheritance classical genetics according the theory mendelian inheritance variations phenotype the observable physical and behavioral characteristics are due part variations genotype the particular set each which specifies particular different forms which may give rise different are known alleles organisms such the pea plants mendel worked along with many plants and have two alleles for each one inherited from each alleles may dominant recessive dominant alleles give rise their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same whereas recessive alleles give rise their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy the same for the allele specifying tall stems pea plants dominant over the allele specifying short then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall mendel work demonstrated that alleles assort independently the production gametes germ cells ensuring variation the next mutation mutation dna replication for the most part extremely with error rate per site around eukaryotes although prokaryotes and the rate much rare spontaneous alterations the base sequence particular gene arise from number such errors dna replication and the aftermath dna damage these errors are called mutations the cell contains many dna repair mechanisms for preventing mutations and maintaining the integrity the however some such breaks both dna strands repairing the physical damage the molecule higher priority than producing exact due the degeneracy the genetic some mutations coding genes are silent produce change the amino acid sequence the protein for which they for the codons ucu and ucc both code for serine the mutation has effect the mutations that have phenotypic effects are most often neutral deleterious the variants may confer benefits the fitness commonly thought that mutations may produce beneficial the most common mutations include point mutations which single codon frame shift mutation where single nucleotide base inserted deleted from the dna strand that all bases are shifted silent mutations where single nucleotide base replaced but without causing change for the amino acid being coded and nonsense where change single nucleotide base causes codon turned into stop codon hence terminating transcription this mutations propagated the next generation lead variations within population variants single gene are known alleles and differences alleles may give rise differences although rare for the variants single gene have clearly distinguishable phenotypic certain defined traits are fact controlled single genetic most common allele called the wild type allele and rare alleles are called mutants however this does not imply that the type allele the ancestor from which the mutants are for the most these mutations are recessive and are phased out however occasion these mutations appear dominant other becoming predominant and increasing the rate they are seen genome chromosomal organization the total complement genes organism cell known its genome prokaryotes the vast majority genes are located single chromosome circular dna while eukaryotes usually possess multiple individual linear dna helices packed into dense protein complexes called chromosomes genes that appear together one chromosome one species may appear separate chromosomes another many species carry more than one copy their genome within each their somatic cells cells organisms with only one copy each chromosome are called haploid those with two copies are called diploid and those with more than two copies are called polyploid the copies genes the chromosomes are not necessarily sexually reproducing one copy normally inherited from each number genes human genome early estimates the number human genes that used expressed sequence tag data put following the sequencing the human genome and other has been found that rather few genes mouse and rice encode all the proteins these coding sequences make the human large part the genome transcribed introns retrotransposons and seemingly large array noncoding rnas total number proteins the proteome estimated million genetic and genomic nomenclature gene nomenclature has been established the hugo gene nomenclature committee hgnc for each known human gene the form approved gene name and symbol form abbreviation all approved symbols are stored the hgnc database each symbol unique and each gene only given one approved gene this also facilitates electronic data retrieval from preference each symbol maintains parallel construction different members gene family and can used other species especially the mouse essential genes essential genes essential genes are those genes organism that are thought critical for its surprisingly few genes have been shown absolutely essential for the survival only about the genes escherichia coli evolutionary concept gene george williams first explicitly advocated the gene centric view evolution his book adaptation and natural selection proposed evolutionary concept gene used when are talking about natural selection favoring some the definition that which segregates and recombines with appreciable according this even asexual genome could considered insofar that have appreciable permanency through many the difference the molecular gene transcribes and the evolutionary gene inherits richard dawkins books the selfish gene and the extended phenotype defended the idea that the gene the only replicator living this means that only genes transmit their structure largely intact and are potentially immortal the form genes should the unit selection river out eden dawkins further refined the idea centric selection describing life river compatible genes flowing through geological time scoop bucket genes from the river and have organism serving temporary bodies survival machines river genes may fork into two branches representing two interbreeding species result geographical gene targeting and implications gene targeting gene targeting commonly referred techniques for altering disrupting mouse genes and provides the mouse models for studying the roles individual genes embryonic development human aging and the mouse where one more its genes are deactivated made are called knockout mice since the first reports which homologous recombination among homologous chromosomes embryonic stem cells was used generate targeted gene targeting has proven powerful means precisely manipulating the mammalian producing least ten thousand mutant mouse strains and now possible introduce mutations that can activated specific time specific cells both during development and the adult gene targeting strategies have been expanded all kinds including point mutations isoform mutant allele large pieces chromosomal dna insertion and deletion tissue specific disruption combined with spatial and temporal regulation and predicted that the ability generate mouse models with predictable phenotypes will have major impact studies all phases immunology neurobiology oncology physiology metabolism and human gene targeting also theory applicable species from which totipotent embryonic stem cells can and therefore may offer potential the improvement domestic animals and changing concept the concept the gene has changed considerably see history section from the original definition unit the term evolved mean dna based unit that can exert its effects the organism through rna protein products was also previously believed that one gene makes one this concept was overthrown the discovery alternative splicing and trans splicing the definition gene still the first cases based inheritance have been discovered evidence also accumulating that the control regions gene not necessarily have close the coding sequence the linear molecule even the same spilianakis and colleagues discovered that the promoter region the interferon gamma gene chromosome and the regulatory regions the cytokine locus chromosome come into close proximity the nucleus possibly jointly even the coding sequence gene itself have all the same marande and burger showed the mitochondria the protist diplonema papillatum genes are systematically fragmented into small pieces that are encoded separate transcribed and then concatenated into contiguous messenger rna the concept that genes are clearly delimited also being there evidence for fused proteins stemming from two adjacent genes that can produce two separate protein while not clear whether these fusion proteins are the phenomenon more frequent than previously even more breaking than the discovery fused genes the observation that some proteins can composed exons from far away regions and even different this new data has led and probably definition gene union genomic sequences encoding coherent set potentially overlapping functional this new definition categorizes genes functional whether they proteins rather than specific dna all regulatory elements dna are therefore classified
