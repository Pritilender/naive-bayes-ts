genetic code predicting the genetic code expanded genetic code origin see also references further reading external links discovery serious efforts understand how proteins are encoded began after the structure dna was discovered james watson and francis crick who used the experimental evidence maurice wilkins and rosalind franklin among george gamow postulated that sets three bases must employed encode the standard amino acids used living cells build with four different code nucleotides would allow for only maximum amino code nucleotides could code for maximum amino the crick brenner experiment first demonstrated that codons consist three dna marshall nirenberg and heinrich matthaei were the first elucidate the nature codon the national institutes health they used cell free system translate uracil rna sequence uuuuu and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted only the amino acid phenylalanine they thereby deduced that the codon uuu specified the amino acid this was followed experiments severo ochoa laboratory that demonstrated that the adenine rna sequence coded for the polypeptide lysine and that the cytosine rna sequence coded for the polypeptide therefore the codon aaa specified the amino acid lysine and the codon ccc specified the amino acid proline using different copolymers most the remaining codons were then subsequent work har gobind khorana identified the rest the genetic shortly robert holley determined the structure transfer rna the adapter molecule that facilitates the process translating rna into this work was based upon earlier studies severo ochoa who received the nobel prize physiology medicine for his work the enzymology rna extending this nirenberg and philip leder revealed the triplet nature the genetic code and deciphered the codons the standard genetic these various combinations mrna were passed through filter that contained ribosomes the components cells that translate rna into unique triplets promoted the binding specific trnas the leder and nirenberg were able determine the sequences out codons their khorana holley and nirenberg received the nobel prize physiology medicine for their salient features sequence reading frame codon defined the initial nucleotide from which translation for the string read from the first contains the codons aaa and and read from the second contains the codons gga and read starting from the third gaa and every sequence thus read three reading frames each which will produce different amino acid sequence the given gly gly respectively with stranded there are six possible reading frames three the forward orientation one strand and three reverse the opposite the actual frame which protein sequence translated defined start codon usually the first aug codon the mrna start stop codons translation starts with chain initiation codon start unlike stop the codon alone not sufficient begin the nearby sequences such the shine dalgarno sequence coli and initiation factors are also required start the most common start codon which read methionine formylmethionine alternative start codons depending the organism include gug uug these codons normally represent valine and respectively but start codons they are translated methionine the three stop codons have been given uag amber uga opal sometimes also called umber and uaa ochre amber was named discoverers richard epstein and charles steinberg after their friend harris whose last name means amber the other two stop codons were named ochre and opal order keep the color theme stop codons are also called termination nonsense codons they signal release the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because there cognate trna that has anticodons complementary these stop and release factor binds the ribosome effect mutations mutations during the process dna replication errors occasionally occur the polymerization the second these called mutations can have impact the phenotype especially they occur within the protein coding sequence error rates are usually very error every million due the proofreading ability dna polymerases missense mutations and nonsense mutations are examples point mutations which can cause genetic diseases such sickle cell disease and thalassemia respectively clinically important missense mutations generally change the properties the coded amino acid residue between being acidic polar whereas nonsense mutations result stop codon mutations that disrupt the reading frame sequence indels insertions deletions multiple nucleotide bases are known frameshift mutations these mutations usually result completely different translation from the and are also very likely cause stop codon which truncates the creation the these mutations may impair the function the resulting and are thus rare vivo protein coding one reason inheritance frameshift mutations rare the protein being translated essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism absence functional protein may cause death before the organism frameshift mutations may result severe genetic diseases such tay sachs disease although most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful some mutations have beneficial effect these mutations may enable the mutant organism withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms reproduce more these cases mutation will tend become more common population through natural selection viruses that use rna their genetic material have rapid mutation which can since these viruses will evolve constantly and and thus evade the defensive responses the human immune system large populations asexually reproducing for coli multiple beneficial mutations may this phenomenon called clonal interference and causes competition among the degeneracy codon degeneracy degeneracy the redundancy the genetic the genetic code has redundancy but ambiguity see the codon tables below for the full for although codons gaa and gag both specify glutamic acid neither them specifies any other amino acid the codons encoding one amino acid may differ any their three for example the amino acid leucine specified uug cuu cuc cua codons difference the first third position indicated using iupac notation while the amino acid serine specified ucg ucc ucu agu codons difference the second third practical consequence redundancy that errors the third position the triplet codon cause only silent mutation error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity maintained equivalent substitution amino for codon nun where any tends code for hydrophobic amino ncn yields amino acid residues that are small size and moderate nan encodes average size hydrophilic the genetic code structured for hydropathy that mathematical analysis singular value decomposition variables nucleotides positions yields remarkable correlation for predicting the hydropathy the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide without note the below eight amino acids are not affected all mutations the third position the whereas the figure the mutation the second position likely cause radical change the physicochemical properties the encoded amino hydropathy genetic code transfer information via the genetic code the genome organism inscribed dna the case some rna the portion the genome that codes for protein rna called gene those genes that code for proteins are composed nucleotide units called codons each coding for single amino each nucleotide unit consists phosphate deoxyribose sugar and one the four nitrogenous nucleobases the purine bases adenine and guanine are larger and consist two aromatic the pyrimidine bases cytosine and thymine are smaller and consist only one aromatic the helix two strands dna are joined each other hydrogen bonds arrangement known base pairing these bonds almost always form between adenine base one strand and thymine base the other between cytosine base one strand and guanine base the this means that the number and bases will the same given double will the number and thymine replaced uracil and the deoxyribose substituted ribose each coding gene transcribed into molecule the related rna prokaryotes this rna functions messenger rna eukaryotes the transcript needs processed produce mature the mrna translated ribosome into chain amino acids otherwise known polypeptide the process translation requires transfer rnas which are covalently attached specific amino guanosine triphosphate energy and number translation trnas have anticodons complementary the codons mrna and can covalently charged with specific amino acids their terminal cca ends enzymes known aminoacyl trna synthetases which have high specificity for both their cognate amino acid and the high specificity these enzymes major reason why the fidelity protein translation there are different codon combinations possible with triplet codon three all codons are assigned either amino acid stop for rna sequence uuuaaaccc considered and the reading frame starts with the first there are three namely uuu aaa and each which specifies one amino therefore this base rna sequence will translated into amino acid sequence that three amino acids given amino acid may encoded between one and six different codon comparison may made using bioinformatics tools wherein the codon similar word which the standard data chunk and nucleotide similar bit that the smallest this allows for powerful comparisons across species well within the standard genetic code shown the following table shows which amino acid each the codons table shows which codons specify each the standard amino acids involved these are called forward and reverse codon respectively for the codon aau represents the amino acid asparagine and ugu and ugc represent cysteine standard letter asn and respectively rna codon table phenylalanine serine tyrosine cysteine leucine stop ochre opal amber tryptophan proline histidine arginine glutamine isoleucine threonine asparagine lysine methionine valine alanine aspartic acid glycine glutamic acid mrna iupac notation start stop dna codon table dna codon table the dna codon table essentially identical that for but with replaced variations the standard genetic code list genetic codes while slight variations the standard code had been predicted none were discovered until when researchers studying human mitochondrial genes discovered they used alternative many slight variants have been discovered since including various alternative mitochondrial and small variants such translation the codon uga tryptophan mycoplasma species and translation cug serine rather than leucine yeasts the ctg candida albicans member this because viruses must use the same genetic code their modifications the standard genetic code could interfere with the synthesis functioning viral however some viruses such totiviruses have adapted the genetic code modification the bacteria and archaea gug and uug are common start but rare certain proteins may use alternative start codons not normally used that certain non standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop depending associated signal sequences the messenger for uga can code for selenocysteine and uag can code for pyrrolysine selenocysteine now viewed the amino and pyrrolysine viewed the unlike pyrrolysine encoded uag translated with the participation dedicated trna both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may present the same although the genetic code normally fixed organism the achaeal prokaryote acetohalobium arabaticum can expand its genetic code from amino acids including under different conditions despite these all known occurring codes are very similar each and the coding mechanism the same for all three base trna ribosomes reading the code the same direction and translating the code three letters time into sequences amino predicting the genetic code the genetic

protein domains are most often aligned every the resulting amino acid probabilities for each codon are displayed genetic code that also shows the support for stop expanded genetic code expanded genetic code nucleic acid analogues since non natural amino acids have been added into protein creating unique codon and corresponding trna synthetase pair encode with diverse physicochemical and biological properties order used tool exploring protein structure and function create novel enhanced murakami and sisido have extended some codons have four and five steven benner constructed functional vivo codon origin amino acids were randomly assigned triplet then there would possible genetic codes choose from however the genetic code used all known forms life nearly universal with few minor one could has all life earth descended from single bacterium that mutated make the final optimization the universal genetic many hypotheses the evolutionary origins the universal genetic code have been four themes run through the many hypotheses about the evolution the genetic chemical principles govern specific rna interaction with amino experiments with aptamers showed that some amino acids have selective chemical affinity for the base triplets that code for recent experiments show that the amino acids show some rna amino acid biosynthetic expansion the standard modern genetic code grew from simpler earlier code through process biosynthetic here the idea that primordial life discovered new amino acids for products metabolism and later incorporated some these into the machinery genetic although much circumstantial evidence has been found suggest that fewer different amino acids were used the past than precise and detailed hypotheses about which amino acids entered the code what order have proved far more natural selection has led codon assignments the genetic code that minimize the effects mutations recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons such quadruplet longer than triplet decoding would have higher degree codon redundancy and would more error resistant than the triplet this feature could allow accurate decoding the absence highly complex translational machinery such the ribosome and before cells began making information information theoretic approaches model the process translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids prone information the inherent noise that the the channel poses the organism with fundamental how can genetic code constructed withstand the impact noise while accurately and efficiently translating these models suggest that the genetic code originated result the interplay the three conflicting evolutionary the needs for diverse for tolerance and for minimal cost the code emerges coding transition when the mapping codons acids becomes the emergence the code governed the topology defined the probable errors and related the map coloring problem transfer rna molecules appear have evolved before modern aminoacyl trna synthetases the latter cannot part the explanation its models encompassing aspects two more the above themes have also been for models based signaling games combine elements game natural selection and information such models have been used suggest that the first polypeptides were likely short and had some use other than enzymatic game theoretic models have also suggested that the organization rna strings into cells may have been necessary prevent deceptive use the genetic preventing the ancient equivalent viruses from overwhelming the rna the distribution codon assignments the genetic code for the genetic code clusters certain amino acid amino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend have the same first base their amino acids with similar physical properties tend have similar reducing the problems caused point mutations and robust hypothesis for the origin genetic code should also address
