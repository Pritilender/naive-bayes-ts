origin term the term was created hans winkler professor botany the university hamburg germany the oxford english dictionary suggests the name blend the words gene and chromosome few related ome words already such biome rhizome and more connectome forming vocabulary into which genome fits overview some organisms have multiple copies chromosomes diploid triploid tetraploid and classical sexually reproducing organism typically eukarya the gamete has half the number chromosomes the somatic cell and the genome full set chromosomes the halving the genetic material gametes accomplished the segregation homologous chromosomes during haploid organisms including cells bacteria archaea and organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts viruses that similarly contain the single set circular linear chains dna rna for some viruses likewise constitute the the term genome can applied specifically mean what stored complete set nuclear dna the nuclear genome but can also applied what stored within organelles that contain their own with the mitochondrial genome the chloroplast genome additionally the genome can comprise chromosomal genetic elements such viruses plasmids and transposable elements when people say that the genome sexually reproducing species has been sequenced typically they are referring determination the sequences one set autosomes and one each type sex chromosome which together represent both the possible even species that exist only one what described genome may composite read from the chromosomes various colloquially the phrase genetic sometimes used signify the genome particular individual citation needed the study the global properties genomes related organisms usually referred genomics which distinguishes from genetics which generally studies the properties single genes groups both the number base pairs and the number genes vary widely from one species and there only rough correlation between the two observation known the value paradox the highest known number genes around for the protozoan causing trichomoniasis see list sequenced eukaryotic genomes almost three times many the human genome analogy the human genome stored dna that instructions stored the book would contain chapters each chapter contains million letters without hence the book contains over billion letters the book fits into cell nucleus the size least one copy the book all contained most cells our the only exception humans found mature red blood cells which become enucleated during development and therefore lack sequencing and mapping genome project walter fiers the university ghent belgium was the first establish the complete nucleotide sequence viral genome bacteriophage the next phage with only base became the first genome project fred sanger the first complete genome sequences for representatives from all domains life were released within short period during the the first bacterial genome sequenced was that haemophilus influenzae completed team the institute for genomic research few months the first eukaryotic genome was with the chromosomes budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae being released the result led effort begun the shortly the first genome sequence for archaeon methanococcus jannaschii was again the institute for genomic the development new technologies has made dramatically easier and cheaper and the number complete genome sequences growing the national institutes health maintains one several comprehensive databases genomic among the thousands completed genome sequencing projects include those for mouse rice the plant arabidopsis thaliana the puffer fish and bacteria like coli december scientists for the first the entire genome neanderthal extinct species humans the genome was extracted from the toe bone old neanderthal found siberian new sequencing such massive parallel sequencing have also opened the prospect personal genome sequencing diagnostic pioneered manteia predictive medicine major step toward that goal was the completion the full genome james watson one the discoverers the structure whereas genome sequence lists the order every dna base genome map identifies the genome map less detailed than genome sequence and aids navigating around the the human genome project was organized map and sequence the human fundamental step the project was the release detailed genomic map jean weissenbach and his team the genoscope genome compositions genome composition used describe the make contents haploid which should include genome size proportions non repetitive dna and repetitive dna comparing the genome compositions between genomes scientists can better understand the evolutionary history given when talking about genome one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes the big differences contents structure they most the genome repetitive which means coding dna mainly forms while coding regions only take small the eukaryotes have the feature intron organization protein coding the variation repetitive dna content eukaryotes also extremely when refer mammalians and the major part genome composed repetitive most biological entities that are more complex than virus sometimes always carry additional genetic material besides that which resides their some such sequencing the genome pathogenic genome meant include information stored this auxiliary which carried plasmids such circumstances genome describes all the genes and information coding dna that have the potential eukaryotes such protozoa and however genome carries the typical connotation only information chromosomal although these organisms contain chloroplasts mitochondria that have their own the genetic information contained dna within these organelles not considered part the mitochondria are sometimes said have their own genome often referred the mitochondrial genome the dna found within the chloroplast may referred the plastome genome size log log genbank genome size the total number dna base pairs one copy haploid the genome size positively correlated with the morphological complexity among prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes however after mollusks and all the other higher eukaryotes this correlation longer this phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive dna act the since genomes are very one research strategy reduce the number genes genome the bare minimum and still have the organism question there experimental work being done minimal genomes for single cell organisms well minimal genomes for cellular organisms see developmental

human genome fish protopterus aethiopicus proportion repetitive dna the proportion repetitive dna calculated using length repetitive dna divided genome protein coding genes and coding genes are generally repetitive bigger genome does not mean more and the proportion repetitive dna decreases along with the increase genome size higher had been found that the proportion repetitive dna can vary lot between some coli prokaryotes only have repetitive lower eukaryotes such elegans and fruit fly still possess more repetitive dna than repetitive higher eukaryotes tend have more repetitive dna than repetitive some plants and the proportion repetitive dna more than becoming minority proportion repetitive dna the proportion repetitive dna calculated using length repetitive dna divide genome there are two categories repetitive dna tandem repeats and interspersed tandem repeats tandem repeats are usually caused slippage during unequal over and gene satellite dna and microsatellites are forms tandem repeats the although tandem repeats count for significant proportion the largest proportion mammalian the other interspersed interspersed repeats interspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements but they also include some protein coding gene families and transposable elements are able integrate into the genome another site within the believed that tes are important driving force genome evolution higher tes can classified into two class and class dna retrotransposons retrotransposons can transcribed into which are then duplicated another site into the retrotransposons can divided into long terminal repeats and long terminal repeats env gene dictyostelium discoideum alu element dna transposons dna transposons generally move cut and the but duplication has also been class tes not use rna intermediate and are popular metazoan has also been genome evolution genomes are more than the sum genes and have traits that may measured and studied without reference the details any particular genes and their researchers compare traits such chromosome number karyotype genome size gene order codon usage bias and content determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety genomes that exist today for recent see brown saccone and pesole benfey and protopapas gibson and muse reese gregory duplications play major role shaping the duplication may range from extension short tandem repeats duplication cluster and all the way duplication entire chromosomes even entire genomes such duplications are probably fundamental the creation genetic horizontal gene transfer invoked explain how there often extreme similarity between small portions the genomes two organisms that are otherwise very distantly horizontal gene transfer seems common among many microbes also eukaryotic cells seem have experienced transfer some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes their nuclear see also bacterial genome size
