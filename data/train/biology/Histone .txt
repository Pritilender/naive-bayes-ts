histone navigation search biology histones are highly alkaline proteins found eukaryotic cell nuclei that package and order the dna into structural units called nucleosomes they are the chief protein components chromatin acting spools around which dna and play role gene regulation without the unwound dna chromosomes would very long length width ratio more than million human for each human cell has about meters but wound the histones has about micrometers which when duplicated and condensed during mitosis result about micrometers chromosomes pdb pfam pfam interpro scop hio superfamily hio pfam

five major families histones and histones and are known the core while histones and are known the linker two each the core histones assemble form one octameric nucleosome core approximately angstroms diameter solenoid like base pairs dna wrap around this core particle times handed helical turn give particle around angstroms the linker histone binds the nucleosome the entry and exit sites the thus locking the dna into place and allowing the formation higher order the most basic such formation the fiber beads string this involves the wrapping dna around nucleosomes with approximately base pairs dna separating each pair nucleosomes also referred linker dna higher order structures include the fiber forming irregular and these being the structures found normal during mitosis and the condensed chromosomes are assembled through interactions between nucleosomes and other regulatory the following list human histone fnt foo afj afv afx afy afz hist bfm bfs bfwt hist hist structure the nucleosome core formed two dimers and tetramer forming two nearly symmetrical halves tertiary structure symmetry one macromolecule the mirror image the the dimers and tetramer also show pseudodyad the histones and are relatively similar structure and are highly conserved through evolution all featuring helix turn helix turn motif which allows the easy they also share the feature long one end the

substrate recognition domain proteins despite the differences their these three folds share homologous helix motif using electron paramagnetic resonance spin labeling british researchers measured the distances between the spools around which eukaryotic cells wind their they determined the spacings range from histones make five types interactions with helix dipoles from alpha helices and cause net

minor groove insertions the and terminal tails into two minor grooves each the dna molecule the highly basic nature aside from facilitating histone contributes their water histones are subject post translational modification enzymes primarily their terminal but also their globular domains citation needed such modifications include methylation citrullination acetylation phosphorylation sumoylation ubiquitination and adp ribosylation this affects their function gene regulation see function section genes that are active have less bound while inactive genes are highly associated with histones during interphase citation needed also appears that the structure histones has been evolutionarily conserved any deleterious mutations would severely all histones have highly positively charged terminus with many lysine and arginine residues history histones were discovered albrecht kossel the word histone dates from the late century and from the german histon uncertain perhaps from greek histanai from histos until the early histones were dismissed most inert packing material for eukaryotic nuclear based part the ball and models mark ptashne and others who believed that transcription was activated dna and protein interactions largely naked dna the case during the work michael grunstein demonstrated that eukaryotic histones repress gene and that the function transcriptional activators overcome this now known that histones play both positive and negative roles gene forming the basis the histone code the work vincent allfrey histone modification was pioneering regarded father the discovery the histone appears date back and classification has been grouped with conservation across species histones are found the nuclei eukaryotic cells and certain archaea namely thermoproteales and euryarchaea but not bacteria the unicellular algae known dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes that are known completely lack archaeal histones may well resemble the evolutionary precursors eukaryotic histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins emphasizing their important role the biology the contrast mature sperm cells largely use protamines package their genomic most likely because this allows them achieve even higher packaging core histones are highly conserved that there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences the histone proteins different linker histone usually has more than one form within species and also less conserved than the core citation needed there are some variant forms some the major they share amino acid sequence homology and core structural similarity specific class major histones but also have their own feature that distinct from the major these minor histones usually carry out specific functions the chromatin for histone like cenpa associated with only the centromere region the histone variant associated with the promoters actively transcribed genes and also involved the prevention the spread silent heterochromatin furthermore has roles chromatin for genome another variant binds the dna with double strand breaks and marks the region undergoing dna repair histone associated with the body actively transcribed function compacting dna strands histones act spools around which dna this enables the compaction necessary fit the large genomes eukaryotes inside cell the compacted molecule times shorter than unpacked chromatin regulation histones undergo posttranslational modifications that alter their interaction with dna and nuclear the and histones have long tails protruding from the nucleosome which can covalently modified several modifications the tail include methylation acetylation phosphorylation ubiquitination sumoylation citrullination and the core the histones and can also combinations modifications are thought constitute the called histone code histone modifications act diverse biological processes such gene regulation dna repair chromosome condensation

histone modifications transcription regulation methylation activation repression acetylation functions histone modifications huge catalogue histone modifications have been but functional understanding most still collectively thought that histone modifications may underlie histone code whereby combinations histone modifications have specific however most functional data concerns individual prominent histone modifications that are biochemically amenable detailed chemistry histone modifications lysine methylation the addition two three methyl groups lysine has little effect the chemistry the methylation leaves the charge the lysine intact and adds minimal number atoms steric interactions are mostly however proteins containing chromo phd amongst can recognise lysine methylation with exquisite sensitivity and differentiate and methyl the extent for some lysines mono and methylation appear have different because lysine methylation tends very informative mark and dominates the known histone modification arginine methylation what was said above the chemistry lysine methylation also applies arginine and some protein tudor can specific for methyl arginine instead methyl arginine known and methylation can symmetric potentially with different lysine acetylation addition acetyl group has major chemical effect lysine neutralises the positive this reduces electrostatic attraction between the histone and the negatively charged dna loosening the chromatin highly acetylated histones form more accessible chromatin and tend associated with active lysine acetylation appears less precise meaning than that histone acetyltransferases tend act more than one presumably this reflects the need alter multiple lysines have significant effect chromatin serine tyrosine phosphorylation addition negatively charge phosphate group can lead major changes protein leading the characterised role phosphorylation controlling protein not clear what structural implications histone

actively transcribed genes two histone modifications are particularly associated with active trimethylation lysine the promoter active genes trimethylation performed the compass despite the

broadly correlated with transcriptional activity the the formation this mark tied transcription rather convoluted early transcription rna polymerase undergoes switch from initiating marked change the phosphorylation states the rna polymerase terminal domain the same enzyme that phosphorylates the ctd also phosphorylates the complex which turn adds ubiquitin mark occurs throughout transcribed but this mark required for compass trimethylate trimethylation lysine the body active genes trimethylation deposited the methyltransferase this protein associates with elongating rna polymerase and indicative actively transcribed recognised the histone deacetylase which removes acetyl modifications from surrounding increasing chromatin compaction and repressing spurious increased chromatin compaction prevents transcription factors from accessing and reduces the likelihood new transcription events being initiated within the body the this process therefore helps ensure that transcription not repressed genes three histone modifications are particularly associated with repressed trimethylation lysine this histone modification depositied the polycomb complex clear marker gene and likely bound other proteins exert repressive another polycomb complex prc can bind and adds the histone modification which aids chromatin based this data appears that recruited through the action however recent studies show that recruited the same sites the absence and methylation lysine characterised marker for heterochromatin and therefore strongly associated with gene the formation heterochromatin has been best studied the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe where initiated recruitment the rna induced transcriptional silencing complex double stranded rnas produced from centromeric repeats rits recruits the histone methyltransferase which deposits this process called histone methylation serves binding site for the recruitment heterochromatin protein another classic heterochromatin which turn recruits further repressive activities including histone modifiers such histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases trimethylation lysine this modification tightly associated with although its functional importance remains this mark placed the which least part recruited heterochromatin protein bivalent promoters analysis histone modifications embryonic stem cells and other stem revealed many gene promoters carrying both and other words these promoters display both activating and repressing marks this peculiar combination modifications marks genes that are poised for they are not
