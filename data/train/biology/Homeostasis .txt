homeostasis navigation search hemostasis homeostasis also spelled homoeostasis hom ostasis from greek similar and sis standing the property system which variables are regulated that internal conditions remain stable and relatively examples homeostasis include the regulation temperature and the balance between acidity and alkalinity process that maintains the stability the human internal environment response changes external the concept was described claude bernard and the word was coined walter bradford cannon and although the term was originally used refer processes within living frequently applied automatic control systems such thermostats homeostasis requires sensor detect changes the condition effector mechanism that can vary that and negative feedback connection between

maintain fluid pressures temperature chemical etc controlling pumps and the centrifugal governor steam engine designed james watt reduces the throttle valve response increases the engine opens the valve the speed falls below the set biological human homeostasis all living organisms depend maintaining complex set interacting metabolic chemical from the simplest unicellular organisms the most complex plants and internal processes operate keep the conditions within tight limits allow these reactions homeostatic processes act the level the cell the tissue and the organ well for the organism principal homeostatic processes include the endothermic animals mammals and maintain constant body whereas ectothermic animals almost all other exhibit wide body temperature variation advantage temperature regulation that allows organism function effectively broad range environmental for ectotherms tend become sluggish low whereas located endotherm may fully that thermal stability comes since automatic regulation system requires additional the temperature the body loses heat sweating via the latent heat evaporation this counteracted increased metabolic and coated thickening the tarantula ectothermic endothermic regulation the the blood measure alkalinity and all animals also regulate their blood glucose concentration mammals regulate their blood glucose with insulin and glucagon the human body maintains glucose levels constant most the even after hour even during long periods glucose levels are reduced only very insulin secreted the beta cells the effectively transports glucose the cells instructing those cells keep more the glucose for their own use see dynamic equilibrium the glucose inside the cells the cells will convert the insoluble glycogen prevent the soluble glucose from interfering with cellular ultimately this lowers blood glucose and insulin helps prevent hyperglycemia when insulin deficient cells become resistant diabetes occurs glucagon secreted the alpha cells the encourages cells break down stored glycogen convert carbohydrate carbon sources glucose via gluconeogenesis thus preventing hypoglycemia the kidneys are used remove excess water and ions from the these are then expelled urine the kidneys perform vital role homeostatic regulation removing excess salt and urea from the the water content the blood and lymph fluid restored the first instance extracting water from the the throat and mouth become that the symptoms thirst motivate the animal the oxygen content the blood the dioxide concentration blood flow increased more vigorous heart action and the speed and depth breathing sleep timing depends upon balance between homeostatic sleep the need for sleep function the amount time elapsed since the last adequate sleep and circadian rhythms that determine the ideal timing correctly structured and restorative sleep control mechanisms all homeostatic control mechanisms have least three interdependent components for the variable being the receptor the sensing component that monitors and responds changes the when the receptor senses sends information control the component that sets the range which variable the control center determines appropriate response the the control center then sends signals which can organs other structures that receive signals from the control after receiving the change occurs correct the deviation depressing with negative feedback negative feedback negative feedback mechanisms consist reducing the output activity any organ system back its normal range good example this regulating blood pressure blood vessels can sense resistance blood flow against the walls when blood pressure the blood vessels act the receptors and they relay this message the brain the brain then sends message the heart and blood both which are the the heart rate would decrease the blood vessels increase diameter known vasodilation this change would cause the blood pressure fall back its normal the opposite would happen when blood pressure and would cause vasoconstriction another important example seen when the body deprived the body would then reset the metabolic set point lower than normal this would allow the body continue slower even though the body therefore people depriving themselves food while trying lose weight would find easy shed weight initially and much harder lose more this due the readjusting itself lower metabolic point allow the body survive with its low supply exercise can change this effect increasing the metabolic another good example negative feedback mechanism temperature the hypothalamus which monitors the body capable determining even the slightest variation normal body temperature degrees celsius response such variation could stimulation glands that produce sweat reduce the temperature signaling various muscles shiver increase body both feedbacks are equally important for the healthy functioning complications can arise any the two feedbacks are affected altered any homeostatic imbalance many diseases involve disturbance the organism the efficiency its control systems becomes the inefficiencies gradually result unstable internal environment that increases the risk and leads the physical changes associated with certain homeostatic such high core high concentration salt the low concentration can generate homeostatic emotions such thirst which motivate behavior aimed restoring homeostasis such removing drinking slowing ecological the concept homeostasis central the topic ecological stoichiometry there refers the relationship between the chemical composition organism and the chemical composition the nutrients stoichiometric homeostasis helps explain nutrient recycling and population throughout ecological succession was seen having stable stage called the climax see frederic clements sometimes referred the potential shaped primarily the local this idea has been largely abandoned modern ecologists favor nonequilibrium ideas how ecosystems most natural ecosystems experience disturbance rate that makes climax community only isolated habitats known ecological islands can the phenomenon one such case study the island krakatoa after its major eruption the established stable homeostasis the previous forest climax ecosystem was and all life was eliminated from the the years after the krakatoa went through sequence ecological changes which successive groups new plant animal species followed one leading increasing biodiversity and eventually culminating established climax this ecological succession krakatoa occurred number sere defined stage sequence events which succession the complete chain seres leading climax called prisere the case the island reached its climax with eight hundred different recorded one hundred years after the eruption that cleared all life off the evidence confirms that this number has been homeostatic for some with the introduction new species rapidly leading elimination old the evidence and other disturbed island has confirmed many principles island biogeography mimicking general principles ecological succession albeit virtually closed system comprised almost exclusively endemic species biosphere the gaia hypothesis james lovelock stated that the entire mass living matter earth any planet with functions vast homeostatic superorganism that actively modifies its planetary environment produce the environmental conditions necessary for its own this the entire planet maintains whether this sort system present earth still open however some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally for sometimes claimed that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels certain plants are able grow better and thus act remove more carbon dioxide from the dubious discuss however warming has exacerbated making water the actual limiting factor when sunlight plentiful and atmospheric temperature has been claimed that the phytoplankton the ocean surface waters may thrive and produce more dimethyl sulfide dms the dms molecules act cloud condensation nuclei which produce more and thus increase the atmospheric albedo and this feeds back lower the temperature the however rising sea temperature has stratified the separating sunlit waters from nutrient rich thus nutrients have become the limiting and plankton levels have actually fallen over the past years not scientists discover more about vast numbers positive and negative feedback loops are being that together maintain metastable sometimes within very broad range environmental environmental such competition change can lead extinction species over reactive example reactive homeostasis immediate homeostasic response challenge such however any homeostasis impossible without because homeostasis and must feedback phenomenon the phrase reactive simply short for reactive compensation reestablishing that reestablishing point should not confused with separate kind homeostasis distinct phenomenon from homeostasis simply the compensation phase other fields the term has come used other for risk risk homeostasis actuary may refer risk homeostasis where for people that have lock brakes have better safety record than those without lock because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via safe driving previous the innovation lock certain maneuvers involved minor evoking fear and now the lock system moves the boundary for such and behavior patterns expand into the longer punitive has also been suggested citation needed that ecological crises are instance risk homeostasis which particular behavior continues until proven dangerous dramatic consequences actually stress sociologists and psychologists may refer stress homeostasis the tendency population individual stay certain level often generating artificial stresses the natural level stress not citation needed ois lyotard postmodern has applied this term societal power that describes being governed principle for the scientific which will sometimes ignore radical new discovery for years because destabilises previously accepted see the postmodern report knowledge ois psychological author george leonard discusses his book mastery how homeostasis affects our behavior and who states that homeostasis will prevent our body from making drastic changes and maintain stability our lives even detrimental examples include when obese person starts homeostasis the body resists the activity maintain another example leonard uses unstable family where the father has been raging alcoholic and suddenly stops and the son starts drug habit maintain stability the homeostasis the main factor that stops people changing their habits because our bodies view change dangerous unless very leonard discusses this the media today encourages only fast change and quick the opening his book describes his despair with the current state the world and how war with the trouble that have maps guide the journey even show how find the the modern can viewed prodigious conspiracy against continually bombarded with the promises immediate instant and temporary all which lead exactly the wrong see also
