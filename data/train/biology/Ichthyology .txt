refinement the principles furthermore recognized five additional orders malacopterygii acanthopterygii branchiostegi chondropterygii and artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements anatomical features that are modernly another associate albertus seba was prosperous pharmacist from amsterdam seba assembled invited artedi utilize this assortment unfortunately artedi fell into amsterdam canal and drowned the age linnaeus posthumously published manuscripts ichthyologia sive opera omnia piscibus his refinement taxonomy culminated the development the binomial nomenclature which use contemporary furthermore revised the orders introduced placing significance pelvic fins fishes lacking this appendage were placed within the order fishes containing thoracic
