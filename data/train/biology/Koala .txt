outgroup the koala was given its generic name phascolarctos french zoologist henri marie ducrotay blainville who would not give specific name until further german zoologist georg august goldfuss gave the binomial lipurus cinereus because phascolarctos was published according the international code zoological nomenclature has priority the official name the french naturalist anselme tan desmarest proposed the name phascolartos fuscus suggesting that the coloured versions were different species than the grey other names suggested european authors included marodactylus cinereus goldfuss flindersii ren primev lesson and koala john edward gray the koala classified with wombats family and several extinct families including marsupial tapirs marsupial lions and giant wombats the suborder vombatiformes within the order diprotodontia vombatiformes sister group clade that includes macropods kangaroos and wallabies and possums the ancestors vombatiforms were likely arboreal and the lineage was possibly the first branch off around million years ago during the eocene the modern koala the only extant member phascolarctidae family that once included several genera and during the oligocene and miocene koalas lived rainforests and had less specialised some such the riversleigh rainforest koala nimiokoala greystanesi and some species perikoala were around the same size the modern while such species litokoala were half thirds its like the modern prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that distance vocalising developed during the the australian continent began drying leading the decline rainforests and the spread open eucalyptus woodlands the genus phascolarctos split from litokoala the late miocene and had several adaptations that allowed live specialised eucalyptus shifting the palate towards the front the larger molars and premolars smaller pterygoid fossa and larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth during the pliocene and pleistocene when australia experienced changes climate and koala species grew phascolarctos cinereus may have emerged dwarf form the giant koala stirtoni the reduction the size large mammals has been seen common phenomenon worldwide during the late pleistocene and traditionally believed that several australian such the agile wallaby resulted from this study questions this noting that cinereus and stirtoni were sympatric during the middle late and possibly early the the fossil record the modern koala extends back least the middle genetics and variations three different subspecies have been the queensland koala cinereus adustus thomas the new south wales koala cinereus goldfuss and the victorian koala victor troughton these forms are distinguished pelage colour and body size and skull the queensland koala the smallest the with silver fur and shorter the victorian koala the with brown fur and wider the boundaries these variations are based state borders and their status subspecies are genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between and that the three subspecies comprise single evolutionarily significant unit other studies have found that koala populations have high levels inbreeding and low genetic variation such low genetic diversity may have been characteristic koala populations since the late rivers and roads have been shown limit gene flow and contribute the genetic differentiation southeast queensland april scientists from the queensland university technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome description play media the koala stocky animal with large head and vestigial existent has body length and weight making among the largest arboreal koalas from victoria are twice heavy those from the species sexually dimorphic with males larger than males are further distinguished from females their more curved noses and the presence chest which are visible hairless

the pouch opening tightened sphincter that keeps the young from falling the pelage the koala thicker and longer the and shorter the the ears have thick fur both the inside and the back fur colour varies from light grey chocolate the belly fur the rump dappled and darker the the koala has the most effective insulating back fur any marsupial and highly resilient wind and while the belly fur can reflect solar the sharp claws are well adapted for climbing the large forepaws have two opposable digits the first and which are opposable the other that allow them grasp small the the second and third digits are fused typical condition for members and the attached claws which are still are used for humans and other primates koalas have friction ridges their the animal has sturdy skeleton and muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute its climbing and grasping additional climbing strength achieved with thigh muscles that attach the shinbone lower than other

relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials that the pupils have vertical koalas make use novel vocal organ produce pitched sounds see social spacing below unlike typical mammalian vocal cords which are folds the these organs are placed the velum soft palate and are called velar vocal molars premolars diastema canines incisors the koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt which low nutritive high toxicity and high dietary fibre the dentition consists the incisors and cheek teeth single premolar and four molars each which are separated large gap characteristic feature herbivorous the incisors are used for grasping which are then passed the premolars snipped the petiole before being passed the highly cusped molars where they are shredded into small koalas may also store food their cheek pouches before ready the partially worn molars aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small resulting more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption the small which digests the eucalyptus leaves provide most the koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth chewed second unlike kangaroos and eating koalas are hindgut fermenters and their digestive retention can last for hours the hours this made possible the extraordinary length their caecum long and the largest proportionally any koalas can select which food particles retain for longer fermentation and which pass large particles typically pass through more they would take more time while the hindgut proportionally larger the koala than other only the energy obtained from since the koala gains low amount energy from its its metabolic rate half that typical although this can vary between seasons and the koala conserves water passing relatively dry faecal pellets high undigested and storing water the ecology and behaviour the geographic range covers roughly square kilometres and ecoregions extends throughout eastern and southeastern encompassing central and southeastern eastern new south victoria and southeastern south australia the koala was introduced near adelaide and several including kangaroo island and french island the population magnetic island represents the northern limit its fossil evidence shows that the range stretched far west southwestern western australia during the late they were likely driven extinction these areas environmental changes and hunting indigenous australians koalas are unevenly distributed and uncommon except the where they are new south they are abundant only pilliga while victoria they are common nearly south koalas were extirpated and subsequently koalas can found habitats ranging from relatively open forests woodlands and climates ranging from tropical cool temperate semi arid climates they prefer riparian habitats where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times drought and extreme foraging and activities koalas are herbivorous and while most their diet consists eucalypt they can found trees other such acacia allocasuarina callitris leptospermum and melaleuca although the foliage over species eucalyptus the koala shows strong preference for around they tend choose species that have high protein content and low proportions fibre and lignin the most favoured species are eucalyptus microcorys tereticornis and camaldulensis which make more than percent their despite its reputation fussy the koala more generalist than some other marsupial like the greater glider since eucalypt leaves have high water the koala does not need drink its daily water turnover rate ranges from millilitres per kilogram body although females can meet their water requirements from eating larger males require additional water found the ground tree when koala holds onto branch with hindpaws and one forepaw while the other forepaw grasps small koalas can move close the end but larger ones stay near the thicker koalas consume grams leaves spread over four six feeding despite their adaptations energy they have meagre fat reserves and need feed because they get little energy from their koalas must limit their energy use and sleep hours only minutes day are spent active they are predominantly active night and spend most their waking hours they typically eat and sleep the same possibly for long very hot days koala may climb down the coolest part the tree which colder than the surrounding the koala will hug the tree lose heat without warm koala may rest with its back against branch lie its stomach back with its limbs during wet curls itself into tight ball conserve windy koala will find thicker branch rest while spends most the time the the animal will descend the ground move another walking all the koala usually grooms itself with its hind but sometimes uses its forepaws social spacing play media lone pine koala sanctuary koalas are asocial animals and spend just minutes day social home ranges are small and have extensive while central queensland they are larger and overlap koala society appears consist residents and transients the former being mostly adult females and the latter resident males appear territorial and dominate others with their larger body alpha males tend establish their territories close breeding while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full adult males occasionally venture outside their home when they dominant ones retain their when male enters new marks rubbing his chest gland against the trunk males have occasionally been observed dribble urine the this marking behaviour probably serves and individuals are known sniff the base tree before scent marking common during aggressive chest gland secretions are complex chemical about compounds were identified one that vary composition and concentration with the season and the age the adult males communicate with loud low pitched sounds that consist like inhalations and resonant exhalations that sound like has been hypothesized that these sounds are generated unique vocal organs found because their low frequency these bellows can travel far through air and koalas may bellow any time the particularly during the breeding season when serves attract females and possibly intimidate other they also bellow advertise their presence their neighbours when they enter new these sounds signal the actual body size well exaggerate females pay more attention bellows that originate from larger female koalas though more addition making wails and these calls are produced when distress and when making defensive young koalas squeak when they get the squeak develops into squawk that produced both when distress and show when another individual climbs over koala makes low grunt with its mouth koalas make numerous facial when wailing the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears during the lips retract and the ears are drawn females bring the lips forward and raise their ears when agonistic behaviour typically consists squabbles between individuals climbing over passing each this occasionally involves males who are strangers may chase and bite each extreme male may try displace smaller rival from this involves the larger aggressor climbing and attempting corner the who tries either rush past him and climb down move the end the aggressor attacks grasping the target the shoulders and repeatedly biting once the weaker individual driven the victor bellows and marks the pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and will attack individuals that come too however koalas tend avoid wasting aggressive reproduction and development koalas are seasonal and births take place from october females oestrus tend hold their head further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms however males not appear recognise these and have been observed mount oestrous because his much larger male can usually force himself mounting her from and extreme cases the male may pull the female out the female may scream and vigorously fight off her but will submit one who who more the bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males the obliging the incumbent delay mating and fight the intruders these fights may allow the

koalas may live from years the while female koalas usually live this males may die sooner because their more hazardous koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back but injuries and deaths from falls particularly inexperienced young and fighting around six years the chewing teeth begin wear down and their chewing efficiency eventually the cusps will disappear completely and the animal will die koalas have few dingos and large pythons may prey while birds prey such powerful owls and wedge tailed eagles are threats they are generally not subject external parasites other than ticks coastal koalas may also suffer mange from the mite sarcoptes scabiei and skin ulcers from the bacterium mycobacterium ulcerans but neither are internal parasites are few and largely these include the tapeworm bertiella obesa commonly found the and the nematodes marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and durikainema phascolarcti which are infrequently found the year study almost koalas admitted the australian zoo wildlife hospital the animals were infected with least one species the parasitic protozoal genus trypanosoma the most common which was irwini koalas can subject pathogens like chlamydiaceae bacteria which can cause keratoconjunctivitis urinary tract infection and reproductive tract infection such infections are widespread the mainland but absent some island the koala retrovirus may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome which similar aids prevalence korv koala populations suggests trend spreading from the north the south northern populations are completely while some southern populations including kangaroo are the animals are vulnerable bushfires due their slow movements and the flammability eucalypt the koala instinctively seeks refuge the higher where vulnerable intense heat and bushfires also fragment the which restricts their movement and leads population decline and loss genetic dehydration and overheating can also prove consequently the koala vulnerable the effects climate change models climate change australia predict warmer and drier suggesting that the range will shrink the east and south more mesic habitats droughts also affect the for severe drought caused many eucalyptus trees lose their subsequently the population southwestern queensland especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites dominant and recovery the population was later this population declined from estimated mean population reduction attributed largely hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts most years between and another predicted negative outcome climate change the effect elevations atmospheric levels the food increases cause eucalyptus trees reduce protein and increase tannin concentrations their reducing the quality the food human relations history arcana the first written reference the koala was recorded john servant john hunter the governor new south wales price encountered the cullawine january during expedition the blue mountains although his account was not published until nearly century later historical records australia french born explorer francis louis barrallier encountered the animal when his two aboriginal returning from brought back two koala feet they were intending barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes philip gidley king who forwarded them joseph banks similar barrallier notes did not get published until reports the koolah appeared the sydney gazette late and helped provide the impetus for king commission the artist john lewin paint watercolours the
