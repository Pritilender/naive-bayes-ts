sterols fat soluble vitamins such vitamins and monoglycerides diglycerides triglycerides phospholipids and the main biological functions lipids include storing signaling and acting structural components cell membranes lipids have applications the cosmetic and food industries well lipids may broadly defined hydrophobic amphiphilic small the amphiphilic nature some lipids allows them form structures such vesicles multilamellar unilamellar liposomes membranes aqueous biological lipids originate entirely part from two distinct types biochemical subunits ketoacyl and isoprene groups using this lipids may divided into eight fatty acids glycerolipids glycerophospholipids sphingolipids saccharolipids and polyketides derived from condensation ketoacyl and sterol lipids and prenol lipids derived from condensation isoprene although the term lipid sometimes used synonym for fats fats are subgroup lipids called triglycerides lipids also encompass molecules such fatty acids and their derivatives including tri monoglycerides and phospholipids well other sterol containing metabolites such cholesterol although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both break down

residues when they form part are diverse group molecules synthesized elongation acetyl coa primer with malonyl coa methylmalonyl coa groups process called fatty acid synthesis they are made hydrocarbon chain that terminates with carboxylic acid group this arrangement confers the molecule with polar hydrophilic end and hydrophobic end that insoluble the fatty acid structure one the most fundamental categories biological and commonly used block more structurally complex the carbon typically between four and carbons may saturated unsaturated and may attached functional groups containing oxygen halogens nitrogen and sulfur fatty acid contains double there the possibility either cis trans geometric isomerism which significantly affects the configuration cis double bonds cause the fatty acid chain effect that compounded with more double bonds the three double bonds carbon linolenic acid the most abundant acyl chains plant thylakoid membranes render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks high resolution nmr spectra this turn plays important role the structure and function cell most naturally occurring fatty acids are the cis configuration although the trans form does exist some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and examples biologically important fatty acids include the eicosanoids derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid that include prostaglandins leukotrienes and thromboxanes docosahexaenoic acid also important biological particularly with respect other major lipid classes the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such wax esters fatty acid thioester coenzyme derivatives fatty acid thioester acp derivatives and fatty acid the fatty amides include acyl ethanolamines such the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide glycerolipids glycerolipids are composed and substituted glycerols the most known being the fatty acid triesters called triglycerides the word triacylglycerol sometimes used synonymously with triglyceride these the three hydroxyl groups glycerol are each typically different fatty because they function energy these lipids comprise the bulk storage fat animal the hydrolysis the ester bonds triglycerides and the release glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue are the initial steps metabolising additional subclasses glycerolipids are represented which are characterized the presence one more sugar residues attached glycerol via glycosidic linkage examples structures this category are the digalactosyldiacylglycerols found plant membranes and seminolipid from mammalian sperm cells glycerophospholipids glycerophospholipids usually referred phospholipids are ubiquitous nature and are key components the lipid bilayer well being involved metabolism and cell signaling neural tissue including the contains relatively high amounts and alterations their composition has been implicated various neurological glycerophospholipids may subdivided into distinct based the nature the polar headgroup the position the glycerol backbone eukaryotes and the position the case archaebacteria examples glycerophospholipids found biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine also known gpcho lecithin phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine addition serving primary component cellular membranes and binding sites for and intercellular some glycerophospholipids eukaryotic such phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors themselves membrane derived second messengers typically one both these hydroxyl groups are acylated with chain fatty but there are also linked and linked plasmalogen glycerophospholipids well dialkylether variants sphingolipids sphingolipids are complicated family compounds that share common structural sphingoid base backbone that synthesized novo from the amino acid serine and chain fatty acyl then converted into ceramides phosphosphingolipids glycosphingolipids and other the major sphingoid base mammals commonly referred sphingosine ceramides sphingoid are major subclass sphingoid base derivatives with amide linked fatty the fatty acids are typically saturated unsaturated with chain lengths from carbon the major phosphosphingolipids mammals are sphingomyelins ceramide whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines and fungi have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose containing the glycosphingolipids are diverse family molecules composed one more sugar residues linked via glycosidic bond the sphingoid examples these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such cerebrosides and gangliosides sterol lipids sterol such cholesterol and its are important component membrane along with the glycerophospholipids and the steroids all derived from the same fused ring core have different biological roles hormones and signaling molecules the carbon steroids include the estrogen family whereas the steroids comprise the androgens such testosterone and androsterone the subclass includes the progestogens well the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids the secosteroids comprising various forms vitamin are characterized cleavage the ring the core other examples sterols are the bile acids and their which mammals are oxidized derivatives cholesterol and are synthesized the the plant equivalents are the phytosterols such sitosterol stigmasterol and brassicasterol the latter compound also used biomarker for algal growth the predominant sterol fungal cell membranes ergosterol prenol lipids prenol lipids are synthesized from the unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid pathway the simple isoprenoids linear diphosphates etc are formed the successive addition units and are classified according number these terpene units structures containing greater than carbons are known carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function antioxidants and precursors vitamin another biologically important class molecules exemplified the quinones and hydroquinones which contain isoprenoid tail attached quinonoid core isoprenoid vitamin and vitamin well the ubiquinones are examples this prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols called bactoprenols which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached oxygen remains whereas animal polyprenols dolichols the terminal isoprenoid saccharolipids glucosamine kdo acyl phosphate saccharolipids describe compounds which fatty acids are linked directly sugar forming structures that are compatible with membrane the monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present glycerolipids and the most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors the lipid component the lipopolysaccharides gram negative bacteria typical molecules are disaccharides which are derivatized with many seven acyl the minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth coli kdo lipid acylated disaccharide glucosamine that glycosylated with two octulosonic acid residues polyketides polyketides are synthesized polymerization acetyl and propionyl subunits classic enzymes well iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases they comprise large number secondary metabolites and natural products from plant bacterial fungal and marine and have great structural many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified glycosylation methylation hydroxylation oxidation and other many commonly used anti microbial anti parasitic and anti cancer agents are polyketides polyketide such erythromycins tetracyclines avermectins and antitumor epothilones biological functions membranes eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into bound organelles that carry out different biological the glycerophospholipids are the main structural component biological membranes such the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes organelles animal cells the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment the glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions that contain glycerol core linked two fatty derived tails ester linkages and one head group phosphate ester while glycerophospholipids are the major component biological other glyceride lipid components such sphingomyelin and sterols mainly cholesterol animal cell are also found biological plants and the and which lack phosphate are important components membranes chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids photosynthetic including those higher algae and certain plant thylakoid membranes have the largest lipid component bilayer forming monogalactosyl diglyceride and little despite this unique lipid chloroplast thylakoid membranes have been shown contain dynamic bilayer matrix revealed magnetic resonance and electron microscope bilayers have been found exhibit high levels birefringence which can used probe the degree order within the bilayer using techniques such dual polarization interferometry and circular dichroism phospholipids liposome micelle lipid bilayer biological membrane form lamellar phase lipid bilayer the formation lipid bilayers energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are aqueous this known the hydrophobic aqueous the polar heads lipids align towards the aqueous while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend cluster forming vesicle depending the concentration the this biophysical interaction may result the formation micelles liposomes lipid bilayers other aggregations are also observed and form part the polymorphism amphiphile behavior phase behavior area study within biophysics and the subject current academic micelles and bilayers form the polar medium process known the hydrophobic effect when dissolving lipophilic amphiphilic substance polar the polar molecules water aqueous become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds the lipophilic areas the amphiphile aqueous the water molecules form ordered clathrate cage around the dissolved lipophilic the formation lipids into protocell membranes key step models abiogenesis the origin energy storage triglycerides stored adipose are major form energy storage both animals and the fat designed for continuous synthesis and breakdown triglycerides with breakdown controlled mainly the activation sensitive enzyme lipase the complete oxidation fatty acids provides high caloric about kcal compared with for the breakdown carbohydrates and proteins migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy triglycerides fuel their signaling recent evidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling vital part the cell signaling lipid signaling may occur via activation coupled nuclear receptors and members several different lipid categories have been identified signaling molecules and cellular messengers these include sphingosine phosphate sphingolipid derived from ceramide that potent messenger molecule involved regulating calcium cell and diacylglycerol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates involved mediated activation protein kinase the prostaglandins which are one type acid derived eicosanoid involved inflammation and immunity the steroid hormones such estrogen testosterone and cortisol which modulate host functions such metabolism and blood and the oxysterols such cholesterol that are liver receptor agonists phosphatidylserine lipids are known involved signaling for the phagocytosis apoptotic cells pieces they accomplish this being exposed the extracellular face the cell membrane after the inactivation flippases which place them exclusively the cytosolic side and the activation which scramble the orientation the after this other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells cell fragments exposing citation needed other functions the vitamins and which are based are essential nutrients stored the liver and fatty with diverse range acyl carnitines are involved the transport and metabolism fatty acids and out where they undergo beta oxidation polyprenols and their phosphorylated derivatives also play important transport this case the transport oligosaccharides across polyprenol phosphate sugars and polyprenol diphosphate sugars function cytoplasmic glycosylation extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis for peptidoglycan polymerization and eukaryotic protein glycosylation cardiolipins are subclass glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups that are particularly abundant the inner mitochondrial they are believed activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation lipids also form the basis steroid metabolism the major dietary lipids for humans and other animals are animal and plant sterols and membrane the process lipid metabolism synthesizes and degrades the lipid stores and produces the structural and functional lipids characteristic individual biosynthesis when there oversupply dietary the excess carbohydrate converted this involves the synthesis fatty acids from coa and the esterification fatty acids the production process called lipogenesis fatty acids are made fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce coa the acyl chains the fatty acids are extended cycle reactions that add the acetyl reduce dehydrate alkene group and then reduce again alkane group the enzymes fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out single multifunctional while plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step the the fatty acids may subsequently converted triglycerides that are packaged lipoproteins and secreted from the the synthesis unsaturated fatty acids involves desaturation reaction whereby double bond introduced into the fatty acyl for the desaturation stearic acid stearoyl coa produces oleic acid the doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid well the triply unsaturated linolenic acid cannot synthesized mammalian and are therefore essential fatty acids and must obtained from the triglyceride synthesis takes place the endoplasmic reticulum metabolic pathways which acyl groups fatty coas are transferred the hydroxyl groups phosphate and terpenes and isoprenoids including the carotenoids are made the assembly and modification isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate these precursors can made different animals and archaea the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from while plants and bacteria the non mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde phosphate one important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors steroid biosynthesis here the isoprene units are joined together make squalene and then folded and formed into set rings make lanosterol lanosterol can then converted into other steroids such cholesterol and ergosterol degradation beta oxidation the metabolic process which fatty acids are broken down the mitochondria and peroxisomes generate acetyl coa for the most fatty acids are oxidized mechanism that similar but not identical reversal the process fatty acid that two carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end the acid after steps dehydrogenation hydration and oxidation form beta keto acid which split thiolysis the coa then ultimately converted into atp and using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain hence the krebs cycle can start coa when fat being broken down for energy there little glucose the energy yield the complete oxidation the fatty acid palmitate atp unsaturated and chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for nutrition and health most the fat found food the form cholesterol and some dietary fat necessary facilitate absorption soluble vitamins and and carotenoids humans and other mammals have dietary requirement for certain essential fatty such linoleic acid omega fatty acid and alpha linolenic acid fatty because they cannot synthesized from simple precursors the both these fatty acids are carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing the number and position the double most vegetable oils are rich linoleic acid safflower sunflower and corn oils alpha linolenic acid found the green leaves and selected nuts and legumes particular flax rapeseed walnut and soy fish oils are particularly rich the chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid large number studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption fatty acids infant cancer cardiovascular and various mental such attention deficit hyperactivity and now established that consumption trans fats such those present partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are risk factor for cardiovascular disease few studies have suggested that total dietary fat intake linked increased risk obesity and however number very large including the health initiative dietary modification year study women the health study and the health professionals revealed such none these studies suggested any connection between percentage calories from fat and risk heart weight the nutrition website maintained the department nutrition the harvard school public health summarizes the current evidence the impact dietary detailed much done shows that the total amount fat the diet really linked with
