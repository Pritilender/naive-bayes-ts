biology
marine biology navigation search marine biology the scientific study organisms the ocean other marine brackish bodies given that biology many phyla families and genera have some species that live the sea and others that live marine biology classifies species based the environment rather than taxonomy marine biology differs from marine ecology marine ecology focused how organisms interact with each other and the while biology the study the organisms large proportion all life earth exists the exactly how large the proportion since many ocean species are still the ocean complex dimensional world covering about the the habitats studied marine biology include everything from the tiny layers surface water which organisms and abiotic items may trapped surface tension between the ocean and the depths the oceanic trenches sometimes meters more beneath the surface the specific habitats include coral reefs kelp forests seagrass meadows the surrounds seamounts and thermal vents tidepools muddy sandy and rocky and the open ocean pelagic zone where solid objects are rare and the surface the water the only visible the organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton huge cetaceans meters feet marine life vast providing medicine and raw addition helping support recreation and tourism all over the fundamental marine life helps determine the very nature our marine organisms contribute significantly the oxygen cycle and are involved the regulation the climate shorelines are part shaped and protected marine and some marine organisms even help create new many species are economically important including food fish both finfish and also becoming understood that the being marine organisms and other organisms are linked very fundamental the human body knowledge regarding the relationship between life the sea and important cycles rapidly with new discoveries being made nearly every these cycles include those matter such the carbon cycle and air such earth respiration and movement energy through ecosystems including the large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively contents history subfields related fields animals birds fish invertebrates mammals reptiles fungi plants and algae microscopic life marine habitats intertidal and shore reefs open ocean deep sea and trenches distribution factors see also lists references external links history the hms challenger pioneer expedition history marine biology the earliest instances the study marine biology can traced back aristotle who made several contributions which laid the foundation for many future discoveries and were the first big steps the early exploration period the ocean and marine british edward forbes was also key player the history marine biology and considered many the founder the science oceanography and marine overall the pace oceanographic and marine biology studies quickly accelerated during the course the the observations made the first studies marine biology fueled the age discovery and exploration that during this vast amount knowledge was gained about the life that exists the oceans the many voyages contributed significantly this pool among some the most significant the beagle where charles darwin came with his theories evolution and the formation coral reefs another important expedition the challenger where findings unexpectedly high species diversity fauna stimulated much theorizing population ecologists how such varieties life could maintained what was thought such hostile this era was extremely important for the history marine biology but naturalists were still limited their studies simply because they lacked certain technology that would allow them accurately examine the species that lurked the deep parts the the creation marine labs was important because marine scientists had places conduct research and process their specimens from one the most important marine labs woods hole oceanographic institute where scientists stayed and conducted years significant research and made many important there were also many technological advances that further enhanced the study marine for sound navigation scuba diving submersibles and remotely operated name are some the more impactful technologies marine biology which allowed naturalists explore depths the oceans that people once thought never existed subfields coral reefs biodiversity the marine ecosystem and thus there are many fields marine most involve studying specializations particular animal such phycology invertebrate zoology and ichthyology other subfields study the physical effects continual immersion sea water and the ocean adaptation salty and the effects changing various oceanic properties marine subfield marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean and global warming and environmental issues such carbon dioxide displacement recent marine biotechnology has focused largely marine biomolecules especially proteins that may have uses medicine marine environments are the home many exotic biological materials that may inspire biomimetic materials related fields marine biology branch biology and closely linked oceanography also encompasses many ideas from ecology fisheries science and marine conservation can considered partial offshoots marine biology well environmental studies marine physical oceanography and atmospheric sciences are closely related this animals birds seabird birds adapted living the marine environment are often referred seabirds examples include albatross penguins gannets and auks although they spend most their lives the species such gulls can often found thousands miles fish fish diversity fish fish anatomy includes chambered operculum swim bladder scales fins lips eyes and secretory cells that produce mucous fish breathe extracting oxygen from water through their fins propel and stabilize the fish the many fish fall under two major categories elasmobranchii and teleostei reported species fish have been described december more than the combined total all other about fish species are saltwater crown thorns starfish invertebrates marine invertebrates invertebrates make huge portion all life the invertebrate sea life includes cnidaria such jellyfish and sea anemones ctenophora sea worms including the phyla platyhelminthes nemertea annelida sipuncula echiura chaetognatha and phoronida mollusca including shellfish squid octopus arthropoda including chelicerata and crustacea porifera bryozoa echinodermata including and urochordata including sea squirts tunicates sea otters mammals marine mammal there are five main types marine cetaceans include toothed whales suborder odontoceti such the sperm whale dolphins and porpoises such the dall porpoise cetaceans also include baleen whales suborder mysticeti such the gray whale humpback whale and blue whale sirenians include manatees the dugong and the extinct steller sea cow seals family phocidae sea lions family otariidae which also include the fur and the walrus family odobenidae are all considered pinnipeds the sea otter member the family mustelidae which includes weasels and badgers the polar bear family ursidae sometimes considered marine mammal because its dependence the green turtle reptiles marine reptile reptiles which inhabit frequent the sea include sea turtles sea snakes terrapins the marine iguana and the saltwater crocodile most extant marine except for some sea are oviparous and need return land lay their thus most excepting sea spend most their lives near land rather than the despite their marine most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby around especially waters that are somewhat well near some extinct marine such ichthyosaurs evolved viviparous and had requirement return fungi marine fungi over species fungi are known from marine these parasitize marine algae are saprobes corals protozoan sea wood and other and can also found sea foam spores many species have special appendages which facilitate attachment the very diverse range unusual secondary metabolites produced marine plants and algae plant life widespread and very diverse under the microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute larger proportion the photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests most the niche occupied sub plants land actually occupied macroscopic algae the such sargassum and kelp which are commonly known seaweeds that creates kelp forests the non algae plants that survive the sea are often found shallow such the seagrasses examples which are zostera and turtle thalassia these plants have adapted the high salinity the ocean the intertidal zone also good place find plant life the where mangroves cordgrass beach grass might microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for sometimes acting hiding and foraging places for larval forms larger fish and microscopic life copepod microscopic life undersea incredibly diverse and still poorly for the role viruses marine ecosystems barely being explored even the beginning the the role phytoplankton better understood due their critical position the most numerous primary producers phytoplankton are categorized into cyanobacteria also called green various types algae green brown and diatoms dinoflagellates euglenoids coccolithophorids cryptomonads chrysophytes chlorophytes prasinophytes and silicoflagellates zooplankton tend somewhat and not all are many protozoa are including zooflagellates foraminiferans and radiolarians some these such are also the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down very small other zooplankton include cnidarians ctenophores chaetognaths molluscs arthropods urochordates and annelids such polychaetes many larger animals begin their life zooplankton before they become large enough take their familiar two examples are fish larvae and sea stars also called starfish marine habitats marine habitats coral reefs littoral zone intertidal zone estuaries kelp forests coral reefs ocean banks continental shelf neritic zone straits pelagic zone oceanic zone seamounts hydrothermal vents cold seeps demersal zone benthic zone marine habitats marine habitats can divided into coastal and open ocean habitats coastal habitats are found the area that extends from the shoreline the edge the continental shelf most marine life found coastal even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent the total ocean open ocean habitats are found the deep ocean beyond the edge the continental shelf marine habitats can divided into pelagic and demersal habitats pelagic habitats are found near the surface the open water column away from the bottom the demersal habitats are near the bottom the organism living pelagic habitat said pelagic pelagic fish similarly organism living demersal habitat said demersal demersal fish pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and depending what ocean currents are marine habitats can modified their some marine like kelp and are ecosystem engineers which reshape the marine environment the point where they create further habitat for other intertidal and shore sea anemone california intertidal zones those areas close are constantly being exposed and covered the tides huge array life lives within this shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones the area where land vegetation takes can underwater anywhere from daily very many species here are living off sea life that washed the many land animals also make much use the shore and intertidal subgroup organisms this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process bioerosion reefs coral reef reefs comprise some the densest and most diverse habitats the the known types reefs are tropical coral reefs which exist most tropical however reefs can also exist cold reefs are built corals and other calcium depositing usually top rocky outcrop the ocean reefs can also grow other which has made possible create artificial reefs coral reefs also support huge community including the corals their symbiotic zooxanthellae tropical fish and many other much attention marine biology focused coral reefs and the weather coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events when vast expanses reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above some reefs are but scientists say that between and the coral reefs are now endangered and predict that global warming could exacerbate this open ocean pelagic zone the open ocean relatively unproductive because lack yet because total produces the most primary much the aphotic zone energy supplied the open ocean the form detritus deep sea and trenches the deepest recorded oceanic trench measured date the mariana trench near the philippines the pacific ocean such water pressure extreme and there but some life still white flatfish shrimp and jellyfish were seen the american crew the bathyscaphe trieste when dove the bottom other notable oceanic trenches include monterey canyon the eastern the tonga trench the southwest the philippine trench the puerto rico trench the romanche trench fram basin the arctic ocean the java trench and the south sandwich trench the deep sea considered start the aphotic zone the point where sunlight loses its power transference through the citation needed many life forms that live these depths have the ability create their own light known bio luminescence marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the where fish and other sea life congregate spawn and hydrothermal vents along the mid ocean ridge spreading centers act oases their cold seeps such places support unique biomes and many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered these locations citation needed distribution factors active research topic marine biology discover and map the life cycles various species and where they spend their marine biologists study how the ocean currents tides and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life including their distribution and this has only recently become technically feasible with advances gps and newer underwater visual citation needed most ocean life breeds specific nests not spends time juveniles still and maturity yet scientists know little about where many species spend different parts their life for still largely unknown where sea turtles and some sharks travel tracking devices not work for some life and the ocean not friendly technology this important scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that restricting commercial fishing one small area they can have large impact maintaining healthy fish population much larger area far see also environment
