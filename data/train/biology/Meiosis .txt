meiosis navigation search miosis mitosis myositis figure speech meiosis figure chromosomal crossover meiosis special type cell division necessary for sexual reproduction eukaryotes such plants and the number sets chromosomes the cell undergoing meiosis reduced half the original typically from two sets diploid one set haploid the cells produced meiosis are either gametes the usual case animals otherwise usually spores from which gametes are ultimately produced the case land plants many including all animals and land plants but not some other groups such fungi gametes are called sperm males and egg cells ova since meiosis has halved the number sets when two gametes fuse during fertilisation the number sets chromosomes the resulting zygote restored the original meiotic division occurs two meiosis and meiosis dividing the cells once each before meiosis during phase the cell cycle the dna each chromosome that each chromosome has two sister chromatids diploid organism now has tetraploid dna amount the the first stage meiosis begins with cell that has from diploid two copies each type one from each the mother and called homologous chromosomes each which has two sister the homologous chromosomes pair and may exchange genetic material with each other process called crossing over each pair then separates two cells are each with one chromosome two from every homologous the second each chromosome splits into each each sister separated into two new which are this occurs both the cells formed meiosis therefore from each original four genetically distinct haploid cells are these

while the process meiosis bears number similarities with the cell division process mitosis differs two important shuffles half the same number meiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies each chromosome one from the mother and one from its the cell divides potentially producing four haploid cells containing one copy each potentially because some such the formation oocytes only one the possible four haploid cells animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis male female gamete each the resulting chromosomes the gamete cells unique mixture maternal and paternal resulting offspring that are genetically distinct from either this gives rise genetic diversity sexually reproducing this genetic diversity can provide the variation physical and behavioural attributes phenotypes upon which natural selection can also noteworthy that during specific genes are more highly and these are called the meiome the term used functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome meiosis key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes which homologous chromosome pairing synapse and recombination addition strong meiotic specific expression mrna the however there are also pervasive translational controls selective usage preformed regulating the ultimate meiotic specific protein expression genes during thus both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring meiotic cells needed carry out prior the meiosis process the chromosomes are duplicated round dna replication creating from the maternal and paternal versions each chromosome homologs two exact sister chromatids attached the centromere region the beginning the maternal and paternal homologs pair with each then they typically exchange parts homologous recombination leading crossovers dna between the maternal and paternal versions the spindle fibers bind the centromeres each pair homologs and arrange the pairs the spindle then the fibers pull the recombined homologs opposite poles the the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter each containing haploid number chromosomes composed two after the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter second round cell division there meiosis ends the two sister chromatids making each homolog are separated and move into one the four resulting gamete upon fertilization for example when sperm enters egg two gamete cells produced meiosis the gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half the set chromosomes that make the new genome meiosis uses many the same mechanisms mitosis the type cell division used eukaryotes like plants and animals split one cell into two identical daughter all plants and many protists meiosis results the formation spores haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing some like bdelloid rotifers not have the ability carry out meiosis and have acquired the ability reproduce parthenogenesis meiosis does not occur archaea bacteria which generally reproduce via asexual processes such binary fission however similar sexual process known bacterial involves transfer dna from one bacterium another and recombination these dna molecules different parental history meiosis was discovered and described for the first time sea urchin eggs the german biologist oscar hertwig was described again the level chromosomes the belgian zoologist edouard van beneden ascaris worms eggs the significance meiosis for reproduction and however was described only german biologist august weismann who noted that two cell divisions were necessary transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells the number chromosomes had the american geneticist thomas hunt morgan observed crossover drosophila melanogaster meiosis and provided the first genetic evidence that genes are transmitted the term meiosis was introduced biology farmer and moore propose apply the terms maiosis maiotic phase cover the whole series nuclear changes included the two divisions that were designated heterotype and homotype derived from the greek word occurrence eukaryotic life cycles biological life cycle meiosis occurs eukaryotic life cycles involving sexual reproduction consisting the constant cyclical process meiosis and this takes place alongside normal mitotic cell multicellular there intermediary step between the diploid and haploid transition where the organism the organism will then produce the germ cells that continue the life the rest the called somatic cells function within the organism and will die with cycling meiosis and fertilization events produces series transitions back and forth between alternating haploid and diploid the organism phase the life cycle can occur either during the diploid state gametic diploid life during the haploid state zygotic haploid life both sporic haplodiploid life which there are two distinct organism one during the haploid state and the other during the diploid this sense there are three types life cycles that utilize sexual differentiated the location the organisms citation needed the gametic life cycle diplontic life which humans are the organism grown from diploid cell called the zygote the diploid line stem cells undergo meiosis create haploid gametes the spermatozoa for males and ova for which fertilize form the the diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division mitosis grow into the mitosis related process meiosis that creates two cells that are genetically identical the parent the zygotic life cycle the organism haploid spawned the proliferation and differentiation single haploid cell called the gamete two organisms opposing gender contribute their haploid gametes form diploid the zygote undergoes meiosis creating four haploid these cells undergo mitosis create the many fungi and many protozoa are members the zygotic life citation needed the sporic life cycle the living organism alternates between haploid and diploid consequently this cycle also known the alternation generations the diploid line cells undergo meiosis produce the spores proliferate growing into haploid organism the haploid gamete then combines with another haploid creating the the zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and differentiation become diploid organism the sporic life cycle can considered fusion the gametic and zygotic life citation needed process because meiosis process cannot said engage cell cycle mitosis however the preparatory steps that lead meiosis are identical pattern and name the interphase the mitotic cell citation needed interphase divided into three citation needed growth phase this very active where the cell synthesizes its vast array including the enzymes and structural proteins will need for stage each the chromosomes consists single very molecule this point cells are chromosomes identical somatic citation needed synthesis phase the genetic material each its chromosomes that each the chromosomes becomes complex two identical sister the cell still considered diploid because still contains the same number centromeres the identical sister chromatids have not yet condensed into the densely packaged chromosomes visible with the light this will take place during prophase citation needed growth phase phase seen before mitosis not present actually the first four stages prophase many respects correspond the phase mitotic cell interphase followed meiosis and then meiosis meiosis consists separating the pairs homologous chromosome each made two sister into two one entire haploid content chromosomes contained each the resulting daughter the first meiotic division therefore reduces the ploidy the original cell factor citation needed meiosis consists decoupling each sister strands chromatids and segregating the individual chromatids into haploid daughter the two cells resulting from meiosis divide during meiosis creating haploid daughter meiosis and are each divided into prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase stages similar purpose their analogous subphases the mitotic cell therefore meiosis includes the stages meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase telophase and meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase telophase citation needed meiosis generates genetic diversity two independent alignment and subsequent separation homologous chromosome pairs during the first meiotic division allows random and independent selection each chromosome segregates into each and physical exchange homologous chromosomal regions homologous recombination during prophase results new combinations dna within citation needed phases meiosis divided into meiosis and meiosis which are further divided into karyokinesis and cytokinesis karyokinesis and cytokinesis meiosis meiosis separates homologous producing two haploid cells and thus meiosis referred reductional division regular diploid human cell contains chromosomes and considered because contains pairs homologous however after meiosis although the cell contains chromatids only considered being with chromosomes this because anaphase the sister chromatids will remain together the spindle fibers pull the pair toward the pole the new meiosis equational division similar mitosis will occur whereby the sister chromatids are finally creating total haploid cells chromosomes two from each daughter cell from the first prophase the longest phase during prophase dna exchanged between homologous chromosomes process called homologous recombination this often results chromosomal crossover the new combinations dna created during crossover are significant source genetic variation and may result beneficial new combinations alleles the paired and replicated chromosomes are called bivalents which have two chromosomes and four chromatids with one chromosome coming from each the process pairing the homologous chromosomes called synapsis this non sister chromatids may over points called chiasmata singular chiasma leptotene the first stage prophase the leptotene stage also known leptonema from greek words meaning thin this stage prophase individual each consisting two sister change from the diffuse state they exist during the period growth and gene and condense into visible strands within the however the two sister chromatids are still tightly bound that they are indistinguishable from one during lateral elements the synaptonemal complex assemble leptotene very short duration and progressive condensation and coiling chromosome fibers takes zygotene the zygotene stage also known zygonema from greek words meaning paired occurs the chromosomes approximately line with each other into homologous chromosome this called the bouquet stage because the way the telomeres cluster one end the this the synapsis coming homologous chromosomes takes facilitated assembly central element the synaptonemal complex pairing brought about like fashion and may start the centromere the chromosome ends any other portion individuals pair are equal length and position the thus pairing highly specific and the paired chromosomes are called bivalent tetrad citation needed pachytene the pachytene pronounced pak teen stage also known pachynema from greek words meaning thick the stage when chromosomal crossover crossing occurs nonsister chromatids homologous chromosomes may exchange segments over regions sex chromosomes however are not wholly and only exchange information over small region the sites where exchange chiasmata form the exchange information between the sister chromatids results recombination each chromosome has the complete set information had and there are gaps formed result the because the chromosomes cannot distinguished the synaptonemal the actual act crossing over not perceivable through the and chiasmata are not visible until the next citation needed diplotene during the diplotene stage also known diplonema from greek words meaning two the synaptonemal complex degrades and homologous chromosomes separate from one another the chromosomes themselves uncoil allowing some transcription however the homologous chromosomes each bivalent remain tightly bound the regions where over the chiasmata remain the chromosomes until they are severed anaphase citation needed human fetal oogenesis all developing oocytes develop this stage and stop before this suspended state referred the dictyotene stage and remains until puberty diakinesis chromosomes condense further during the diakinesis stage from greek words meaning moving this the first point meiosis where the four parts the tetrads are actually sites crossing over entangle effectively making chiasmata clearly other than this the rest the stage closely resembles prometaphase the nucleoli disappear the nuclear membrane disintegrates into and the meiotic spindle begins citation needed synchronous processes during these two centrosomes containing pair centrioles animal migrate the two poles the these which were duplicated during function microtubule organizing centers nucleating which are essentially cellular ropes and the microtubules invade the nuclear region after the nuclear envelope attaching the chromosomes the kinetochore the kinetochore functions pulling the chromosome along the attached microtubule toward the originating like train there are four kinetochores each but the pair kinetochores each sister chromatid fuses and functions unit during meiosis microtubules that attach the kinetochores are known kinetochore microtubules other microtubules will interact with microtubules from the opposite these are called nonkinetochore microtubules polar microtubules third type the aster radiates from the centrosome into the cytoplasm contacts components the membrane citation needed metaphase homologous pairs move together along the metaphase kinetochore microtubules from both centrioles attach their respective the homologous chromosomes align along equatorial plane that bisects the due continuous counterbalancing forces exerted the bivalents the microtubules emanating from the two kinetochores homologous the physical basis the independent assortment chromosomes the random orientation each bivalent along the metaphase with respect the orientation the other bivalents along the same equatorial anaphase kinetochore bipolar microtubules severing the recombination nodules and pulling homologous chromosomes since each chromosome has only one functional unit pair whole chromosomes are pulled toward opposing forming two haploid each chromosome still contains pair sister during this time disjunction which one the processes leading genetic diversity each chromosome can end either the daughter nonkinetochore microtubules pushing the centrioles farther the cell elongates preparation for division down the telophase the first meiotic division effectively ends when the chromosomes arrive the each daughter cell now has half the number chromosomes but each chromosome consists pair the microtubules that make the spindle network and new nuclear membrane surrounds each haploid the chromosomes uncoil back into cytokinesis the pinching the cell membrane animal cells the formation the cell wall plant occurs completing the creation two daughter sister chromatids remain attached during telophase citation needed cells may enter period rest known interkinesis interphase dna replication occurs during this citation needed meiosis meiosis the second part the meiotic also known equational mechanically the process similar though its genetic results are fundamentally the end result production four haploid cells chromosomes from the two haploid cells chromosomes each the chromosomes consisting two sister produced meiosis the four main steps meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase citation needed prophase see the disappearance the nucleoli and the nuclear envelope again well the shortening and thickening the centrioles move the polar regions and arrange spindle fibers for the second meiotic citation needed metaphase the centromeres contain two kinetochores that attach spindle fibers from the centrosomes each the new equatorial metaphase plate rotated degrees when compared meiosis perpendicular the previous citation needed this followed anaphase where the centromeres are allowing microtubules attached the kinetochores pull the sister chromatids the sister chromatids convention are now called sister chromosomes they move toward opposing citation needed the process ends with telophase which similar telophase and marked uncoiling and lengthening the chromosomes and the disappearance the nuclear envelopes reform and cleavage cell wall formation eventually produces total four daughter each with haploid set meiosis now complete and ends with four new daughter origin and function meiosis ubiquitous among occurs celled organisms such well multicellular such eukaryotes arose from prokaryotes more than billion years and the earliest eukaryotes were likely celled understand meiosis necessary understand how meiosis arose single celled and the function origin there are two conflicting theories how meiosis one that meiosis evolved from bacterial sex called during the evolution the other that meiosis arose from theory that meiosis evolved from bacterial sex prokaryotic dna from one bacterium released into the surrounding then taken another bacterium and its information integrated into the dna the recipient this process called one theory how meiosis arose that evolved from this the evolutionary transition from prokaryotic sex eukaryotic sex was transformation like complex process requiring the function numerous gene the ability undergo natural transformation among bacterial species least prokaryote species seven different are known competent for key similarity between bacterial sex and eukaryotic sex that dna originating from two different individuals join that homologous sequences are aligned with each and this followed exchange genetic information process called genetic after the new recombinant chromosome formed passed when genetic recombination occurs between dna molecules originating from different the recombination process catalyzed prokaryotes and eukaryotes enzymes that have similar functions and that are evolutionarily one the most important enzymes catalyzing this process bacteria referred and this enzyme has two functionally similar counterparts that act eukaryotic rad and support for the theory that meiosis arose from bacterial transformation comes from the increasing evidence that early diverging lineages eukaryotes have the core genes for this implies that the precursor meiosis was already present the bacterial ancestor for instance the common intestinal parasite giardia intestinalis simple eukaryotic protozoan until thought descended from early diverging eukaryotic lineage that lacked however has since been shown that intestinalis contains within its genome core set genes that function including five genes that function only intestinalis was recently found undergo sex like process involving meiosis gene this and other similar suggest that primitive form was present the common ancestor all ancestor that arose from antecedent theory that meiosis evolved from mitosis mitosis the process eukaryotes for duplicating chromosomes and segregating each the two copies into each the two daughter cells upon somatic cell division that during all cell divisions except those involving meiosis that give rise haploid chromosome number ordinarily not the alternate theory the origin meiosis that meiosis evolved from this early eukaryotes evolved mitosis but lacked meiosis and thus had not yet evolved the eukaryotic sexual only after mitosis became established did meiosis and the eukaryotic sexual cycle the fundamental features this were derived from support for the idea that meiosis arose from mitosis the observation that some features such the meiotic spindles that draw chromosome sets into separate daughter cells upon cell and processes regulating cell division employ the molecular machinery employed however there compelling evidence for period the early evolution eukaryotes during which meiosis and accompanying sexual capability was presumably such suspension would have occurred while the evolution mitosis proceeded from the more primitive chromosome segregation processes ancestral bacteria until mitosis was noted wilkins and there are four novel steps needed meiosis that are not present these pairing homologous extensive recombination between suppression sister chromatid separation the first meiotic and avoiding chromosome replication during the second meiotic they note that the simultaneous appearance these steps appears and the selective advantage for separate mutations cause these steps because the entire sequence required for reliable production set haploid sharing components during the evolution meiosis and mitosis the view that meiosis arose from bacterial during the early evolution mitosis and meiosis could have evolved with both processes using common molecular this mitosis evolved from the molecular machinery used bacteria for dna replication and and meiosis evolved from the bacterial sexual process but meiosis also made use the evolving molecular machinery for dna replication and function single celled eukaryotes generally can reproduce asexually vegetative depending asexual reproduction involves and sexual reproduction involves when sex not obligate part referred facultative present day generally are facultative sexual are many the earliest form sexual reproduction eukaryotes was probably like that day understand the function meiosis facultative sexual next consider under what circumstances these organisms switch from asexual sexual and what function this transition may stress induces the eukaryotic sexual cycle protists abundant evidence indicates that facultative sexual protists tend undergo sexual reproduction under stressful for the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae reproduces mitotically diploid cells when nutrients are but switches meiosis sexual under starvation the unicellular green chlamydomonas reinhardtii grows vegetative cells nutrient rich growth but depletion source nitrogen the medium leads gamete zygote formation and the fissioning yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe treated with cause oxidative substantially increases the proportion cells which undergo the simple multicellular eukaryote volvox carteri undergoes sex response oxidative stress stress from heat these and indicate protists and simple multicellular meiosis adaptation deal with stress induces sex bacteria bacterial sex also appears adaptation for transformation occurs near the end logarithmic when amino acids become limiting bacillus subtilis haemophilus influenzae when cells are grown the end logarithmic streptococcus mutans and other transformation associated with high cell density and biofilm streptococcus pneumoniae transformation induced the dna damaging agent mitomycin these and examples indicate that bacterial like eukaryote meiosis adaptation stressful this observation suggests that the natural selection pressures maintaining meiosis protists are similar the selective pressures maintaining bacterial this similarity further indicates rather than the evolution sex from bacteria theory that dna repair the adaptive advantage meiosis stress however general what specifically about stress that needs overcome and what the specific benefit provided meiosis that enhances survival under stressful again there are two contrasting one meiosis primarily adaptation for repairing dna environmental stresses often lead oxidative stress within the which well known cause dna damage through the production reactive forms known reactive oxygen species dna not can kill cell blocking dna transcription essential when only one strand the dna the lost information nucleotide can ordinarily recovered repair processes that remove the damaged sequence and fill the resulting gap copying from the opposite intact strand the double however ros also cause type damage that difficult referred strand one common example strand damage the strand this genetic information nucleotide lost from both strands the damaged and proper information can only obtained from another intact chromosome homologous the damage the process that the cell uses accurately accomplish this type repair called recombinational meiosis distinct from mitosis that central feature meiosis the alignment homologous chromosomes followed recombination between the two chromosomes which pair are referred sister since they did not arise simply from the replication parental recombination between sister chromosomes meiosis known recombinational repair process that can repair strand breaks and other types strand recombination between sister chromosomes cannot repair strand damages arising prior the replication which produced thus this the adaptive advantage meiosis that facilitates recombinational repair dna damage that otherwise difficult and that occurs result particularly oxidative left this damage would likely lethal gametes and inhibit production viable even multicellular such oxidative stress problem for cell this oxidative stress byproduct oxidative cellular respiration occurring during metabolism all about dna strand breaks occur per cell each cell meiosis which facilitates recombinational repair between sister can efficiently repair these prevalent damages the dna passed germ and consequently prevent loss fertility thus the theory that meiosis arose from bacterial recombinational repair the selective advantage meiosis both single celled eukaryotes and muticellular such theory that genetic diversity the adaptive advantage sex the other stress signal the cell that experiencing change the environment more adverse under this new may beneficial produce progeny that differ from the parent their genetic make among these varied some may more adapted the changed condition than their meiosis generates genetic variation the diploid part the exchange genetic information between the pairs chromosomes after they align thus this the advantage meiosis that facilitates the generation genomic diversity among allowing adaptation adverse changes the however also pointed out otto and the presence fairly stable individuals surviving reproductive age have genomes that function well their current they raise the question why such individuals should risk shuffling their genes with those another occurs during meiotic considerations such this have led many investigators question whether genetic diversity the adaptive advantage summary the two contrasting views the origin meiosis are that evolved from the bacterial sexual process transformation and that evolved from the two contrasting views the fundamental adaptive function meiosis that primarily adaptation for repairing damage the dna transmitted progeny and that primarily adaptation for generating genetic variation among these differing views the origin and benefit meiosis are not resolved among citation needed meiosis facilitates stable sexual reproduction without the halving ploidy chromosome fertilization would result zygotes that have twice the number chromosomes the zygotes from the previous successive generations would have exponential increase chromosome organisms that are normally polyploidy the state having three more sets results extreme developmental abnormalities polyploidy poorly tolerated most animal plants however regularly produce viable polyploidy has been implicated important mechanism plant nondisjunction nondisjunction the normal separation chromosomes meiosis sister chromatids meiosis termed disjunction when the separation not called nondisjunction this results the production gametes which have either too many too few particular and common mechanism for trisomy monosomy nondisjunction can occur the meiosis meiosis phases cellular during mitosis this cause several medical

initiates meiosis divides unequally each the first division results small first polar and much larger daughter the daughter cell then divides again form small second polar and larger since the first polar body normally disintegrates rather than dividing meiosis female mammals results three the oocyte and two polar however before these divisions these cells stop the diplotene stage meiosis and lie dormant within protective shell somatic cells called the follicle follicles begin growth steady pace process known folliculogenesis and small number enter the menstrual cycle menstruated oocytes continue meiosis and arrest meiosis until the process meiosis females occurs during oogenesis and differs from the typical meiosis that features long period meiotic arrest known the dictyate stage and lacks the assistance centrosomes meiosis occurs during spermatogenesis the seminiferous tubules the testicles meiosis during spermatogenesis specific type cell called spermatocytes that will later mature become spermatozoa female mammals meiosis begins immediately after primordial germ cells migrate the ovary the but the meiosis begins the time retinoic derived from the primitive kidney that
