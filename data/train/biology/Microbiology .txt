biology	microbiology navigation search agar plate microorganisms microbiology from greek kros small bios life and logia the study microscopic organisms either unicellular single multicellular cell acellular lacking microbiology encompasses numerous disciplines including virology mycology parasitology and bacteriology eukaryotic microorganisms possess bound cell organelles and include fungi and protists whereas prokaryotic organisms which all are are conventionally classified lacking bound organelles and include eubacteria and archaebacteria microbiologists traditionally relied staining and however less than the microorganisms present common environments can cultured isolation using current microbiologists often rely extraction detection nucleic acid either dna rna viruses have been variably classified they have been considered either very simple microorganisms very complex prions never considered have been investigated however the clinical effects traced them were originally presumed due chronic viral and virologists took discovering infectious application medical microbiology often introduced with medical principles immunology microbiology and immunology otherwise microbiology virology and immunology basic sciences have greatly exceeded the medical applied sciences contents branches pure microbiology taxonomic arrangement integrative arrangement other applied microbiology benefits history ancient the medieval islamic world modern see also references external links branches the branches microbiology can classified into pure and applied microbiology can also classified based the cases mycology protozoology and there considerable overlap between the specific branches microbiology with each other and with other and certain aspects these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope pure microbiology taxonomic arrangement bacteriology the study mycology the study protozoology the study phycology the study parasitology the study immunology the study the immune virology the study nematology the study the nematodes the study integrative arrangement microbial cytology the study microscopic and submicroscopic details microbial physiology the study how the microbial cell functions includes the study microbial microbial metabolism and microbial cell structure microbial ecology the relationship between microorganisms and their microbial genetics the study how genes are organized and regulated microbes relation their cellular closely related the field molecular biology cellular microbiology discipline bridging microbiology and cell biology evolutionary microbiology the study the evolution this field can subdivided microbial taxonomy the naming and classification microbial systematics the study the diversity and genetic relationship generation microbiology the study those microorganisms that have the same characters their systems microbiology discipline bridging systems biology and molecular microbiology the study the molecular principles the physiological processes other nano microbiology the study those organisms nano exo microbiology astro microbiology the study microorganisms outer space list microorganisms tested outer space biological agent the study those microorganisms which are being used weapon applied microbiology medical microbiology the study the pathogenic microbes and the role microbes human includes the study microbial pathogenesis and epidemiology and related the study disease pathology and immunology pharmaceutical microbiology the study microorganisms that are related the production enzymes vitamins and other pharmaceutical products and that cause pharmaceutical contamination and industrial microbiology the exploitation microbes for use industrial examples include industrial fermentation and wastewater treatment closely linked the biotechnology industry this field also includes brewing important application microbial biotechnology the manipulation microorganisms the genetic and molecular level generate useful food microbiology the study microorganisms causing food spoilage and foodborne using microorganisms produce for example agricultural microbiology the study agriculturally relevant this field can further classified into the plant microbiology and plant pathology the study the interactions between microorganisms and plants and plant soil microbiology the study those microorganisms that are found veterinary microbiology the study the role microbes veterinary medicine animal taxonomy environmental microbiology the study the function and diversity microbes their natural this involves the characterization key bacterial habitats such the rhizosphere and phyllosphere soil and groundwater ecosystems open oceans extreme environments extremophiles this field includes other branches microbiology such microbial ecology microbially mediated nutrient cycling geomicrobiology microbial diversity bioremediation water microbiology aquatic the study those microorganisms that are found aeromicrobiology air the study airborne benefits yeast brew beer while some fear microbes due the association some microbes with various human many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such industrial fermentation the production alcohol vinegar and dairy products antibiotic production and vehicles for cloning more complex organisms such scientists have also exploited their knowledge microbes produce biotechnologically important enzymes such taq polymerase reporter genes for use other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such the yeast hybrid system bacteria can used for the industrial production amino acids corynebacterium glutamicum one the most important bacterial species with annual production more than two million tons amino mainly glutamate and variety biopolymers such polysaccharides polyesters and polyamides are produced microorganisms are used for the biotechnological production biopolymers with tailored properties suitable for value medical application such tissue engineering and drug microorganisms are used for the biosynthesis xanthan alginate cellulose cyanophycin poly glutamic levan hyaluronic acid organic oligosaccharides and polysaccharide and microorganisms are beneficial for microbial biodegradation bioremediation agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface pollution sediments and marine the ability each microorganism degrade toxic waste depends the nature each contaminant since sites typically have multiple pollutant the most effective approach microbial biodegradation use mixture bacterial and fungal species and each specific the biodegradation one more types symbiotic microbial communities are known confer various benefits their human and animal health including aiding production beneficial vitamins and amino and suppression pathogenic some benefit may conferred consuming fermented probiotics bacteria potentially beneficial the digestive and prebiotics substances consumed promote the growth probiotic the ways the microbiome influences human and animal well methods influence the microbiome are active areas research has suggested that microorganisms could useful the treatment cancer various strains pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid clostridial vectors can safely administered and their potential deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated variety preclinical history ancient the existence microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before their actual the existence unseen microbiological life was postulated jainism which based mahavira teachings early century paul dundas notes that mahavira asserted existence unseen microbiological creatures living water air and jain scriptures also describe nigodas which are microscopic creatures living large clusters and having very short life and are said pervade each and every part the even tissues plants and flesh the roman marcus terentius varro made references microbes when warned against locating homestead the vicinity swamps because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot seen the which float the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious citation needed the medieval islamic world ibn sina the golden age islamic some scientists had knowledge about such ibn sina his book the canon medicine ibn zuhr also known who discovered scabies germs clarification needed and razi who spoke parasites clarification needed his book the virtuous life girolamo fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection direct indirect vehicle however early claims about the existence microorganisms were and not based microscopic actual observation and discovery microbes had await the invention the microscope the modern anton van leeuwenhoek anton van leeuwenhoek who lived for most his life holland observed bacteria and other microorganisms using lens microscope his own while van leeuwenhoek often cited the first observe robert hooke made the first recorded microscopic the fruiting bodies molds however been suggested that jesuit priest called athanasius kircher was the first observe was among the first design magic lanterns for projection must have been well acquainted with the properties one his books contains chapter which reads translation concerning the wonderful structure things investigated here wrote who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with innumerable multitude also noted that putrid material full innumerable creeping these observations antedate robert micrographia nearly years and were published some years before van leeuwenhoek saw protozoa and years before described having seen laboratory glassware louis pasteur the field bacteriology later subdiscipline was founded the century ferdinand cohn botanist whose studies algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him describe several bacteria including bacillus and beggiatoa cohn was also the first formulate scheme for the taxonomic classification bacteria and discover louis pasteur and robert koch were contemporaries and are often considered the father microbiology and medical microbiology respectively pasteur most famous for his series experiments designed disprove the then widely held theory spontaneous generation thereby solidifying identity biological pasteur also designed methods for food preservation pasteurization and vaccines against several diseases such anthrax fowl cholera and rabies koch best known for his contributions the germ theory disease proving that specific diseases were caused specific pathogenic developed series criteria that have become known the koch postulates koch was one the first scientists focus the isolation bacteria pure culture resulting his description several novel bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent tuberculosis while pasteur and koch are often considered the founders their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity the microbial world because their exclusive focus organisms having direct medical was not until the late century and the work martinus beijerinck and sergei winogradsky the founders general microbiology older term encompassing aspects microbial diversity and that the true breadth microbiology was beijerinck made two major contributions the discovery viruses and the development enrichment culture techniques while his work the tobacco mosaic virus established the basic principles was his development enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact microbiology allowing for the cultivation wide range microbes with wildly different winogradsky was the first develop the concept chemolithotrophy and thereby reveal the essential role played organisms geochemical was responsible for the first isolation and description both nitrifying and nitrogen fixing bacteria french canadian microbiologist felix
