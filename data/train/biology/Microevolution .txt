origin misuse see also references external links contrast with macroevolution microevolution can contrasted with macroevolution which the occurrence scale changes gene frequencies population over geological time period consisting extended the difference largely one microevolution reductionist but macroevolution holistic each approach offers different insights into the evolution macroevolution can seen the sum long periods and thus the two are qualitatively identical while being quantitatively the four processes mutation mutation chromosome mutations are changes the dna sequence genome and are caused radiation viruses transposons and mutagenic chemicals well errors that occur during meiosis dna replication errors are introduced particularly often the process dna replication the polymerization the second these errors can also induced the organism cellular processes such hypermutation during the process dna replication errors occasionally occur the polymerization the second these called mutations can have impact the phenotype especially they occur within the protein coding sequence error rates are usually very error every million due the proofreading ability dna polymerases without proofreading error rates are thousandfold because many viruses rely dna and rna polymerases that lack proofreading they experience higher mutation processes that increase the rate changes dna are called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors dna often interfering with the structure while radiation induces mutations causing damage the dna chemical damage dna occurs naturally and cells use dna repair mechanisms repair mismatches and breaks the repair sometimes fails return the dna its original organisms that use chromosomal crossover exchange dna and recombine errors alignment during meiosis can also cause errors crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes adopt mistaken this makes some regions genomes more prone mutating this these errors create large structural changes dna duplications inversions deletions entire the accidental exchanging whole parts between different chromosomes called translocation mutation can result several different types change dna these can either have alter the product gene prevent the gene from studies the fly drosophila melanogaster suggest that mutation changes protein produced this will probably with about percent these mutations having damaging and the remainder being either neutral weakly due the damaging effects that mutations can have organisms have evolved mechanisms such dna repair remove therefore the optimal mutation rate for species off between costs high mutation such deleterious and the metabolic costs maintaining systems reduce the mutation such dna repair viruses that use rna their genetic material have rapid mutation which can advantage since these viruses will evolve constantly and and thus evade the defensive responses the human immune system mutations can involve large sections dna becoming duplicated usually through genetic recombination these duplications are major source raw material for evolving new with tens hundreds genes duplicated animal genomes every million most genes belong larger families genes shared ancestry novel genes are produced several commonly through the duplication and mutation ancestral recombining parts different genes form new combinations with new here domains act each with particular and independent that can mixed together produce genes encoding new proteins with novel for the human eye uses four genes make structures that sense three for color vision and one for night vision all four arose from single ancestral another advantage duplicating gene even entire genome that this increases redundancy this allows one gene the pair acquire new function while the other copy performs the original other types mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding selection natural selection artificial selection selection the process which heritable traits that make more likely for organism survive and successfully reproduce become more common population over successive sometimes valuable distinguish between naturally occurring natural selection and selection that manifestation choices made artificial selection this distinction rather natural selection nevertheless the dominant part natural selection the natural genetic variation within population organisms means that some individuals will survive more successfully than others their current environment factors which affect reproductive success are also issue which charles darwin developed his ideas sexual selection natural selection acts the phenotype the observable characteristics but the genetic basis any phenotype which gives reproductive advantage will become more common population see allele frequency over this process can result adaptations that specialize organisms for particular ecological niches and may eventually result the emergence new species natural selection one the cornerstones modern biology the term was introduced darwin his groundbreaking book the origin species which natural selection was described analogy artificial selection process which animals and plants with traits considered desirable human breeders are systematically favored for the concept natural selection was originally developed the absence valid theory heredity the time nothing was known modern the union traditional darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries classical and molecular genetics termed the modern evolutionary synthesis natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution genetic drift genetic drift genetic drift the change the relative frequency which gene variant allele occurs population due random sampling that the alleles the offspring the population are random sample those the and chance has role determining whether given individual survives and allele frequency the fraction percentage its gene copies compared the total number gene alleles that share particular genetic drift evolutionary process which leads changes allele frequencies over may cause gene variants disappear and thereby reduce genetic contrast natural selection which makes gene variants more common less common depending their reproductive the changes due genetic drift are not driven environmental adaptive and may neutral detrimental reproductive the effect genetic drift larger small and smaller large vigorous debates wage among scientists over the relative importance genetic drift compared with natural ronald fisher held the view that genetic drift plays the most minor role and this remained the dominant view for several motoo kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory molecular evolution which claims that most the changes the genetic material are caused genetic the predictions neutral based genetic not fit recent data whole genomes these data suggest that the frequencies neutral alleles change primarily due selection linked sites rather than due genetic drift means sampling gene flow gene flow gene flow the exchange genes between which are usually the same examples gene flow within species include the migration and then breeding the exchange pollen gene transfer between species includes the formation hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer migration into out population can change allele well introducing genetic variation into immigration may add new genetic material the established gene pool conversely emigration may remove genetic barriers reproduction between two diverging populations are required for the populations become new species gene flow may slow this process spreading genetic differences between the gene flow hindered mountain oceans and deserts even made structures such the great wall china which has hindered the flow plant depending how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor may still possible for them produce with horses and donkeys mating produce mules such hybrids are generally infertile due the two different sets chromosomes being unable pair during meiosis this closely related species may regularly but hybrids will selected against and the species will remain however viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent possess totally new the importance hybridization creating new species animals although cases have been seen many types with the gray tree frog being particularly studied hybridization however important means speciation since polyploidy having more than two copies each tolerated plants more readily than polyploidy important hybrids allows with the two different sets chromosomes each being able pair with identical partner during polyploids also have more genetic which allows them avoid inbreeding depression small horizontal gene transfer the transfer genetic material from one organism another organism that not its this most common among bacteria this contributes the spread antibiotic resistance when one bacteria acquires resistance genes can rapidly transfer them other horizontal transfer genes from bacteria eukaryotes such the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean beetle callosobruchus chinensis may also have example scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers which appear have received range genes from fungi and viruses can also carry dna between allowing transfer genes even across biological domains large scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors eukaryotic cells and during the acquisition chloroplasts and mitochondria gene flow the transfer alleles from one population migration into out population may responsible for marked change allele immigration may also result the addition new genetic variants the established gene pool particular species there are number factors that affect the rate gene flow between different one the most significant factors greater mobility individual tends give greater migratory animals tend more mobile than although pollen and seeds may carried great distances animals maintained gene flow between two populations can also lead combination the two gene reducing the genetic variation between the two for this reason that gene flow strongly acts against speciation recombining the gene pools the and repairing the developing differences genetic variation that would have led full speciation and creation daughter for species grass grows both sides pollen likely transported from one side the other and vice this pollen able fertilise the plant where ends and produce viable then the alleles the pollen have effectively been able move from the population one side the highway the origin and misuse the term origin the term microevolution was first used botanist robert greenleaf leavitt the journal botanical gazette addressing what called the mystery how formlessness gives rise the production form from formlessness the derived the multiplication parts and the orderly creation diversity among actual which anyone may ascertain the but which one has dissipated the mystery any significant this microevolution forms integral part the grand evolution problem and lies the base that shall have understand the minor process before can thoroughly comprehend the more general however leavitt was using the term describe what would now call developmental biology was not until russian entomologist yuri filipchenko used the terms macroevolution and microevolution his german language und that attained its modern the term was later brought into the speaking world theodosius dobzhansky his book genetics and the origin species misuse speciation young earth creationism and baraminology central tenet that evolution can explain diversity limited number created kinds which can interbreed which they call microevolution while the formation new kinds which they call macroevolution this acceptance microevolution only within kind also typical old earth creationism scientific organizations such the american association for the advancement science describe microevolution small scale change within and macroevolution the formation new but otherwise not being different from accumulation microevolutionary changes leads the main difference between the two processes that one occurs within few whilst the other takes place over thousands years quantitative essentially they describe the same although evolution beyond the species level results beginning and ending generations which could not the intermediate generations even changes the number chromosomes can accounted for intermediate stages which single chromosome divides generational multiple chromosomes well documented example the chromosome difference between humans and the other great describing the fundamental similarity between macro and microevolution his authoritative textbook evolutionary biologist douglas futuyma writes differences between species have the same genetic properties variation within species the degree reproductive isolation between varies from little none complete reproductive like the divergence any other evolves most cases the gradual substitution alleles populations contrary the claims some antievolution evolution life forms beyond the species level speciation has indeed been observed and documented scientists numerous creation science creationists accepted speciation occurring within created baramin but objected what they called third new genus higher rank taxonomy there was ambiguity their ideas where draw line species created and what events and lineages fall within the rubric microevolution see also
