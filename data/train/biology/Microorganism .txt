biology	microorganism single celled navigation search microbe escherichia coli bacteria microorganism from the greek mikros small and organism organism microscopic organism which may single cell multicellular organism the study microorganisms called microbiology subject that began with antonie van leeuwenhoek discovery microorganisms using microscope his own microorganisms are very diverse and include all the bacteria and archaea and almost all the protozoa they also include some members the fungi algae and animals such rotifers many macro animals and plants have juvenile stages which are also some microbiologists also classify viruses but others consider these most microorganisms are microscopic but there are some bacteria such thiomargarita namibiensis and some protozoa such stentor which are macroscopic and visible the naked microorganisms live every part the biosphere including soil hot springs the ocean floor high the atmosphere and deep inside rocks within the crust see also endolith microorganisms are crucial nutrient recycling ecosystems they act decomposers some microorganisms can fix nitrogen they are vital part the nitrogen cycle and recent studies indicate that airborne microorganisms may play role precipitation and march researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive the mariana trench the deepest spot the other researchers reported related studies that organisms thrive inside rocks feet metres below the sea floor under feet metres ocean off the coast the northwestern united according one the you can find microbes everywhere they extremely adaptable and survive wherever they micro organisms are also exploited biotechnology both traditional food and beverage preparation and modern technologies based genetic

was and for about billion years the precambrian eon all organisms were for most the history life earth the only forms life were bacteria algae and fungi have been identified amber that million years which shows that the morphology microorganisms has changed little since the triassic period microorganisms tend have relatively fast rate most microorganisms can reproduce and bacteria are also able freely exchange genes through conjugation transformation and transduction even between widely divergent this horizontal gene transfer coupled with high mutation rate and many other means genetic variation allows microorganisms swiftly evolve via natural selection survive new environments and respond environmental this rapid evolution important has led the recent development super bugs pathogenic bacteria that are resistant modern antibiotics pre microbiology the possibility that microorganisms exist was discussed for many centuries before their discovery the the existence unseen microbiological life was postulated jainism which based mahavira teachings early century paul dundas notes that mahavira asserted the existence unseen microbiological creatures living water air and the jain scriptures also describe nigodas which are microscopic creatures living large clusters and having very short which are said pervade every part the even the tissues plants and the earliest known idea indicate the possibility diseases spreading yet unseen organisms was that the roman scholar marcus terentius varro century book titled agriculture which warns against locating homestead near and because there are bred certain minute creatures that cannot seen the which float the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and they cause serious the canon medicine ibn hypothesized that tuberculosis and other diseases might contagious girolamo fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection direct indirect even without contact over long all these early claims about the existence microorganisms were speculative and were not based any data microorganisms were neither observed nor correctly and accurately described until the the reason for this was that all these early studies lacked the microscope history discovery history biology antonie van leeuwenhoek microbiologist microscope lazzaro spallanzani louis pasteur robert koch disease antonie van leeuwenhoek was one the first people observe using microscopes his own robert hooke contemporary also used microscopes observe microbial his book micrographia describes these observations and coined the term cell before discovery microorganisms had been mystery why grapes could turned into wine milk into cheese why food would leeuwenhoek did not make the connection between these processes and but using did establish that there were forms life that were not visible the naked leeuwenhoek along with subsequent observations spallanzani and ended the held belief that life spontaneously appeared from living substances during the process lazzaro spallanzani found that boiling broth would sterilise killing any microorganisms also found that new microorganisms could only settle broth the broth was exposed louis pasteur expanded upon findings exposing boiled broths the vessels that contained filter prevent all particles from passing through the growth and also vessels with filter with air being admitted via curved tube that would not allow dust particles come contact with the boiling the broth pasteur ensured that microorganisms survived within the broths the beginning his nothing grew the broths the course this meant that the living organisms that grew such broths came from spores rather than spontaneously generated within the thus pasteur dealt the death blow the theory spontaneous generation and supported germ theory robert koch established that organisms can cause found that the blood cattle who were infected with anthrax always had large numbers bacillus anthracis koch found that could transmit anthrax from one animal another taking small sample blood from the infected animal and injecting into healthy and this caused the healthy animal become also found that could grow the bacteria nutrient then inject into healthy and cause based these devised criteria for establishing causal link between organisms and disease and these are now known koch postulates although these postulates cannot applied all they retain historical importance the development scientific thought and are still being used november scientists reported the discovery what may the earliest signs life the oldest complete fossils microbial mat associated with sandstone western australia estimated billion years classification and structure evolutionary tree domains bacteria eukaryotes archaea phyla microorganisms can found almost anywhere the taxonomic organization life the bacteria and archaea are almost always while number eukaryotes are also including most protists some fungi well some animals and viruses are generally regarded not living and therefore not considered although the field microbiology also encompasses the study prokaryotes prokaryote prokaryotes are organisms that lack cell nucleus and the other membrane bound they are almost always although some species such myxobacteria can aggregate into complex structures part their life cycle consisting two domains bacteria and archaea the prokaryotes are the most diverse and abundant group organisms earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature below they are found water soil air animals gastrointestinal tracts hot springs and even deep beneath the crust rocks practically all surfaces that have not been specially sterilized are covered the number prokaryotes earth estimated around five million trillion accounting for least half the biomass bacteria bacteria staphylococcus aureus almost all bacteria are invisible the naked with few extremely rare such thiomargarita namibiensis they lack nucleus and other bound and can function and reproduce individual but often aggregate multicellular their genome usually single loop dna although they can also harbor small pieces dna called plasmids these plasmids can transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation bacteria are surrounded cell wall which provides strength and rigidity their they reproduce binary fission sometimes budding but not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction however many bacterial species can transfer dna between individual cells process referred natural also see transformation the development competence for transformation usually associated with stressful environmental and seems adaptation for facilitating repair dna damage recipient also see natural competence some species form extraordinarily resilient spores but for bacteria this mechanism for not under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double quickly every minutes archaea archaea archaea are also celled organisms that lack nuclei the the differences between bacteria and archaea were not recognised and archaea were classified with bacteria part the kingdom monera however the microbiologist carl woese proposed the three domain system that divided living things into archaea and archaea differ from bacteria both their genetics and for while bacterial cell membranes are made from phosphoglycerides with ester bonds archaean membranes are made ether lipids archaea were originally described extreme such hot springs but have since been found all types only now are scientists beginning realize how common archaea are the with crenarchaeota being the most common form life the dominating ecosystems below these organisms are also common soil and play vital role ammonia oxidation eukaryotes eukaryote most living things that are visible the naked eye their adult form are eukaryotes including humans however large number eukaryotes are also unlike bacteria and archaea eukaryotes contain organelles such the cell nucleus the golgi apparatus and mitochondria their cells the nucleus organelle that houses the dna that makes genome dna itself arranged complex chromosomes mitochondria are organelles vital metabolism they are the site the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation they evolved from symbiotic bacteria and retain remnant like plant cells have cell walls and contain organelles such chloroplasts addition the organelles other chloroplasts produce energy from light photosynthesis and were also originally symbiotic bacteria unicellular eukaryotes consist single cell throughout their life this qualification significant since most multicellular eukaryotes consist single cell called zygote only the beginning their life microbial eukaryotes can either haploid diploid and some organisms have multiple cell nuclei see coenocyte unicellular eukaryotes usually reproduce asexually mitosis under favorable however under stressful conditions such nutrient limitations and other conditions associated with dna they tend reproduce sexually meiosis and syngamy also see meiosis protists protista eukaryotic groups the protists are most commonly unicellular and this highly diverse group organisms that are not easy several algae species are multicellular protists and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between colonial and multicellular the number species protists unknown since may have identified only small studies from have shown that large number protist diversity exitsts deep river sediment and acidic river which suggests that large number eukaryotic microbial communities have yet lorryia formosa animals micro animals some micro animals are multicellular but least one animal myxozoa unicellular its adult microscopic arthropods include dust mites and spider mites microscopic crustaceans include copepods some cladocera and water bears many nematodes are also too small seen with the naked common group microscopic animals are the rotifers which are filter feeders that are usually found fresh some animals reproduce both sexually and asexually and may reach new habitats producing eggs can survive harsh environments that would kill the adult however some simple such tardigrades and can dry out completely and remain dormant for long periods fungi fungus the fungi have several unicellular such yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe some such the pathogenic yeast candida albicans can undergo phenotypic switching and grow single cells some and filamentous hyphae fungi reproduce both budding binary well producing which are called conidia when produced basidiospores when produced plants plant the green algae are large group photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic although some green algae are classified protists others such charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants which are the most familiar group land algae can grow single long chains the green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates usually but not always with two flagella per well various coccoid and filamentous the charales which are the algae most closely related higher cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the there are about species green habitats and ecology microorganisms are found almost every habitat present even hostile environments such the poles deserts geysers rocks and the deep sea some types microorganisms have adapted the extreme conditions and sustained these organisms are known extremophiles extremophiles have been isolated from rocks much kilometres below the and has been suggested that the amount living organisms below the surface may comparable with the amount life above the extremophiles have been known survive for prolonged time vacuum and can highly resistant radiation which may even allow them survive many types microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger some which are mutually beneficial mutualism while others can damaging the host organism parasitism microorganisms can cause disease host they are known pathogens and then they are sometimes referred microbes extremophiles extremophile extremophiles are microorganisms that have adapted that they can survive and even thrive conditions that are normally fatal most for some species have been found the following extreme temperature high low acidity alkalinity less than salinity saturation pressure atm down atm vacuum space radiation extremophiles are significant different they extend terrestrial life into much the hydrosphere crust and their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms their extreme environment can exploited bio technology and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life soil microorganisms the nitrogen cycle soils depends the fixation atmospheric nitrogen one way this can occur the nodules the roots legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria the genera rhizobium mesorhizobium sinorhizobium bradyrhizobium and azorhizobium symbiotic microorganisms symbiotic micro organisms such fungi and algae form association lichen certain fungi form mycorrhizal symbioses with trees that increase the supply nutrients the importance microorganisms are vital humans and the they participate the element cycles such the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle well fulfilling other vital roles virtually all ecosystems such recycling other dead remains and waste products through decomposition microorganisms also have important place most order multicellular organisms symbionts many blame the failure biosphere improper balance use digestion this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed december some forms bacteria that live stomachs help their for cows have variety different organisms their stomachs that are essential their digestion grass and the gastrointestinal tract contains immensely complex ecology typical person harbors more than distinct species representing dozens different lifestyles and the composition and distribution this menagerie varies with state health and the number and type bacteria the gastrointestinal tract vary dramatically healthy individuals the stomach and proximal small intestine contain few largely result the bacteriocidal activity gastric those that are present are aerobes and facultative one interesting testimony the ability gastric acid suppress bacterial populations seen patients with genetic condition which prevents secretion gastric such which are otherwise may have many microorganisms per stomach sharp contrast the stomach and small the contents the colon literally teem with predominantly strict anaerobes bacteria that survive only environments virtually devoid between these two extremes transitional usually the where moderate numbers both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are the gastrointestinal tract sterile but colonization typically begins within few hours starting the small intestine and progressing caudally over period several most mature microbial flora established weeks also clear that microbial populations exert profound effect structure and function the digestive for the morphology the intestine free animals differs considerably from normal animals villi the small intestine are remarkably the rate epithelial cell renew reduced one would the number and size patches the cecum free rats roughly times the size that conventional bacteria the intestinal lumen metabolize variety sterols and for bacteria convert the bile salt cholic acid deoxycholic small intestinal bacteria also have important role sex steroid finally bacterial populations the large intestine digest proteins and lipids that escape digestion and absorption small this particularly critical importance herbivores like cattle and horses which make living consuming however seems that even species like humans and rodents derive significant benefit from the nutrients liberated intestinal use food fermentation microorganisms are used brewing wine making baking pickling and other food making they are also used control the fermentation process the production cultured dairy products such yogurt and cheese the cultures also provide flavour and and inhibit undesirable use water treatment sewage treatment the majority all oxidative sewage treatment processes rely large range microorganisms oxidise organic constituents which are not amenable sedimentation anaerobic microorganisms are also used reduce sludge solids producing methane gas amongst other and sterile mineralised potable water treatment one the slow sand filter employs complex gelatinous layer composed wide range microorganisms remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw use energy algae fuel cellulosic ethanol ethanol fermentation organisms are used fermentation produce and biogas reactors produce methane scientists are researching the use algae produce liquid fuels and bacteria convert various forms agricultural and urban waste into usable fuels use production enzymes micro organisms are used for many commercial and industrial production enzymes and other bioactive examples organic acid produced include acetic acid produced the bacterium acetobacter aceti and other acetic acid bacteria butyric acid butanoic produced the bacterium clostridium butyricum lactic acid lactobacillus and others commonly called lactic acid bacteria citric acid produced the fungus aspergillus niger organisms are used for preparation bioactive molecules and streptokinase produced the bacterium streptococcus and modified genetic engineering used clot buster for removing clots from the blood vessels patients who have undergone myocardial infarctions leading heart cyclosporin bioactive molecule used immunosuppressive agent organ transplantation statins produced the yeast monascus purpureus are commercialised blood cholesterol lowering agents which act competitively inhibiting the enzyme responsible for synthesis use science micro organisms are essential tools biotechnology biochemistry genetics and molecular biology the yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe are important model organisms since they are simple eukaryotes that can grown rapidly large numbers and are easily they are particularly valuable genetics genomics and proteomics micro organisms can harnessed for uses such creating steroids and treating skin scientists are also considering using organisms for living fuel cells and solution for use warfare biological warfare the middle ages diseased corpses were thrown into castles during sieges using catapults other siege engines individuals near the corpses were exposed the pathogen and were likely spread that pathogen importance human health human digestion human flora human bacterial flora and human health organisms can form endosymbiotic relationship with larger for the bacteria that live within the human digestive system contribute gut synthesise vitamins such folic acid and biotin and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates diseases caused microbes pathogenic microbes organisms are the cause many infectious the organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria causing diseases such plague tuberculosis and anthrax protozoa causing diseases such malaria sleeping sickness dysentery and toxoplasmosis and also fungi causing diseases such ringworm candidiasis histoplasmosis however other diseases such influenza yellow fever aids are caused pathogenic viruses which are not usually classified living organisms and are therefore micro organisms the strict clear examples archaean pathogens are although relationship has been proposed between the presence some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease importance ecology decomposition organisms are critical the processes decomposition required cycle nitrogen and other elements the natural hygiene hygiene hygiene the avoidance infection food spoiling eliminating microorganisms from the particular bacteria are found virtually the levels harmful microorganisms can reduced acceptable however some required that object substance completely devoid all living entities and viruses good example this hypodermic needle food preparation microorganisms are reduced preservation methods such the addition vinegar clean utensils used short storage cool complete sterility the two most common methods are irradiation and the use autoclave which resembles pressure cooker there are several methods for investigating the level hygiene sample drinking equipment etc water samples can filtrated through extremely fine this filter then placed nutrient medium microorganisms the filter then grow form visible harmful microorganisms can detected food placing sample nutrient broth designed enrich the organisms various such selective media polymerase chain reaction can then used for the hygiene hard such cooking can tested touching them with solid piece nutrient medium and then allowing the microorganisms grow there are conditions where all microorganisms would and therefore often several methods are for food sample might analyzed three different nutrient mediums designed indicate the presence total bacteria conditions where but not bacteria molds conditions where the growth bacteria prevented antibiotics and coliform bacteria these
