model organism navigation search escherichia coli negative prokaryotic drosophila melanogaster model organism non human species that extensively studied understand particular biological phenomena with the expectation that discoveries made the organism model will provide insight into the workings other model organisms are vivo models and are widely used research human disease when human experimentation would unfeasible unethical this strategy made possible the common descent all living and the conservation metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course evolution studying model organisms can but care must taken when extrapolating from one organism contents selecting model organism use model organisms important model organisms viruses prokaryotes eukaryotes protists fungi plants animals invertebrates vertebrates model organisms used for specific research objectives sexual selection and sexual conflict hybrid zones ecological genomics table model genetic organisms see also references external links selecting model organism models are those organisms with wealth biological data that make them attractive study examples for other species and natural phenomena that are more difficult study continual research these organisms focus wide variety experimental techniques and goals from many different levels from ecology behavior and biomechanics down the tiny functional scale individual tissues organelles and proteins inquiries about the dna organisms are classed genetic models with short generation such the fruitfly and nematode worm experimental models and genomic parsimony investigating pivotal position the evolutionary historically model organisms include handful species with extensive genomic research such the nih model often model organisms are chosen the basis that they are amenable experimental this usually will include characteristics such short life cycle techniques for genetic manipulation inbred strains stem cell lines and methods transformation and specialist living sometimes the genome arrangement facilitates the sequencing the model for being very compact having low proportion junk dna yeast arabidopsis pufferfish when researchers look for organism use their they look for several among these are generation accessibility manipulation genetics conservation and potential economic comparative molecular biology has become more some researchers have sought model organisms from wider assortment lineages the tree life use model organisms there are many model one the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium escherichia coli common constituent the human digestive several the bacterial viruses bacteriophage that infect coli also have been very useful for the study gene structure and gene regulation phages lambda and however bacteriophages are not organisms because they lack metabolism and depend functions the host cells for eukaryotes several particularly saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast have been widely used genetics and cell biology largely because they are quick and easy the cell cycle simple yeast very similar the cell cycle humans and regulated homologous proteins the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster again because easy grow for has various visible congenital traits and has polytene chromosome its salivary glands that can examined
