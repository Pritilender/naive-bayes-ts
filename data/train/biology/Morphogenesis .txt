biology	morphogenesis navigation search morphogenesis morphogenesis from the greek morph shape and genesis creation literally beginning the the biological process that causes organism develop its one three fundamental aspects developmental biology along with the control cell growth and cellular differentiation the process controls the organized spatial distribution cells during the embryonic development organism morphogenesis can take place also mature cell culture inside tumor cell masses morphogenesis also describes the development unicellular life forms that not have embryonic stage their life describes the evolution body structure within taxonomic group morphogenetic responses may induced organisms hormones environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced other organisms toxic chemicals radionuclides released and other mechanical stresses induced spatial patterning the contents history molecular basis cellular basis cell cell adhesion extracellular matrix cell contractility see also notes references external links history some the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions how physical processes and constraints affect biological and hence natural patterns such the spirals phyllotaxis were written arcy wentworth thompson and alan turing where thompson explained animal body shapes being created varying rates growth different for instance create the spiral shell snail turing correctly predicted the diffusion two different chemical one activating and one deactivating set patterns the fuller understanding the mechanisms involved actual organisms required the discovery dna and the development molecular biology and biochemistry the term histomorphogenesis was coined ricql for the same process bone histology molecular basis several types molecules are particularly important during morphogens are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation decisions dependent morphogens typically act through binding specific protein receptors important class molecules involved morphogenesis are transcription factor proteins that determine the fate cells interacting with dna these can coded for master regulatory genes and either activate deactivate the transcription other these secondary gene products can regulate the expression still other genes regulatory the end this another class molecules involved morphogenesis are molecules that control cellular behaviors for example cell migration more their such cell adhesion cell for during gastrulation clumps stem cells switch off their cell become and take new positions within embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and number developmental signaling pathways have been implicated including hedgehog and several examples that illustrate the roles transcription factors and cell adhesion molecules morphogenesis are discussed cellular basis morphogenetic field embryonal carcinoma cells dii genetically altered cadherin micrometres scanning confocal microscopy morphogenesis arises because changes the cellular structure how cells interact these changes can result tissue thinning folding separation one tissue into distinct the latter case often referred cell sorting cell sorting consists cells moving sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells the same the ability cells this has been proposed arise from differential cell adhesion malcolm steinberg through his differential adhesion hypothesis tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic cellular differentiation events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal see epithelial mesenchymal transition mesechymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue consequence changes cell adhesive and contractile following mesenchymal cells can migrate away from epithelium and then associate with other similar cells new cell cell adhesion during embryonic cells are restricted different layers due differential one the ways this can occur when cells share the same cell adhesion molecules for homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups cells that have different adhesion furthermore cells can sort based upon differences adhesion between the even two populations cells with different levels the same adhesion molecule can sort cell culture cells that have the strongest adhesion move the center mixed aggregates moreover cell cell adhesion often modulated cell which can exert forces the cell contacts that two cell populations with equal levels the same adhesion molecule can sort the molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules several types cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class these molecules are cadherins there are dozens different cadherins that are expressed different cell cadherins bind other cadherins like cadherin found many epithelial binds preferentially other cadherin mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such extracellular matrix the extracellular matrix involved keeping tissues providing structural support providing structure for cells migrate collagen laminin and fibronectin are major ecm molecules that are secreted and assembled into fibers and multisubunit transmembrane receptors called integrins are used bind the integrins bind extracellularly laminin other ecm and intracellularly microfilament binding proteins actinin and talin link the cytoskeleton with the integrins also serve receptors trigger signal transduction cascades when binding the studied example morphogenesis that involves ecm mammary gland ductal cell contractility tissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell just like muscle myosin can contract different parts the tissue change its shape typical examples driven contractility tissue morphogenesis occur during the separation caenorhabditis elegans drosophila and zebrafish germ layers often during embryonic cell contractility occurs via periodic pulses see also embryogenesis pattern formation french flag model diffusion neurulation gastrulation axon guidance eye development polycystic kidney disease drosophila
