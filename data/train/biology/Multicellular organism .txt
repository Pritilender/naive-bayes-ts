history multicellularity has evolved independently least times including some like cyanobacteria myxobacteria actinomycetes magnetoglobus multicellularis methanosarcina however complex multicellular organisms evolved only six eukaryotic animals fungi brown red green and evolved repeatedly for plants chloroplastida once twice for animals once for brown algae three times the fungi chytrids ascomycetes and basidiomycetes and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae the first evidence multicellularity from cyanobacteria like organisms that lived between and billion years order true multicellular organisms must solve the problem regenerating whole organism from germ cells sperm and egg cells issue that studied developmental biology therefore the development sexual reproduction unicellular organisms during the climax mesoproterozoic thought have precipitated the development and rise multicellular citation needed dubious discuss multicellular especially living also face the challenge cancer which occurs when cells fail regulate their growth within the normal program changes tissue morphology can observed during this loss multicellularity occurred some like some the myxozoa although some have multicellular and some red algae porphyridium but possible that they are primitivelly fungi are predominately though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular microsporidia and there have been numerous reversions unicellularity across fungi saccharomycotina cryptococcus and other yeasts hypotheses for origin there are various mechanisms which multicellularity could have one hypothesis that group specific cells aggregated into like mass called grex which moved multicellular this essentially what slime molds another hypothesis that primitive cell underwent nucleus thereby becoming syncytium membrane would then form around each nucleus and the cellular space and organelles occupied the thereby resulting group connected cells one organism this mechanism observable drosophila third hypothesis unicellular organism the daughter cells failed resulting conglomeration identical cells one which could later develop specialized this what plant and animal embryos well colonial choanoflagellates because the first multicellular organisms were soft organisms lacking shell other hard body they are not well preserved the fossil one exception may the demosponge which may have left chemical signature ancient the earliest fossils multicellular organisms include the contested grypania spiralis and the fossils the black shales the palaeoproterozoic francevillian group fossil formation gabon gabonionta until recently phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical particularly embryological similarities this living multicellular organisms such animals and plants are more than million years removed from their cell such passage time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups modern and extinct ancestral modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such alloenzymes satellite dna and other molecular markers describe traits that are shared between distantly related the evolution multicellularity could have occurred three and which the the colonial most credited the scientific the symbiotic theory this theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis different species cell each with different over time these organisms would become dependent each other they would not able survive eventually leading the incorporation their genomes into one multicellular each respective organism would become separate lineage differentiated cells within the newly created this kind severely dependent symbiosis can seen such the relationship between clown fish and riterri sea anemones these extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long the other became however the problem with this theory that still not known how each dna could incorporated into one single genome constitute them single although such symbiosis theorized have occurred mitochondria and chloroplasts animal and plant endosymbiosis has happened only extremely rarely even the genomes the endosymbionts have retained element separately replicating their dna during mitosis the host for the two three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen while dependent each other for have separately reproduce and then form create one individual organism once the cellularization theory this theory states that single unicellular with multiple nuclei could have developed internal membrane partitions around each its nuclei many protists such the ciliates slime molds can have several lending support this hypothesis however the simple presence multiple nuclei not enough support the multiple nuclei ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated the macronucleus serves the while the micronucleus used for like reproduction with exchange genetic slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid like syncitial tissues some multicellular not the other way deemed this theory needs demonstrable example and mechanism generation multicellular organism from existing the colonial theory the third explanation multicellularisation the colonial theory proposed haeckel this theory claims that the symbiosis many organisms the same species unlike the symbiotic theory which suggests the symbiosis different led multicellular least presumed multicellularity occurs cells separating and then rejoining cellular slime molds whereas for the majority multicellular types those that evolved within aquatic multicellularity occurs consequence cells failing separate following the mechanism this latter colony formation can simple incomplete cytokinesis though multicellularity also typically considered involve cellular differentiation the advantage the colonial theory hypothesis that has been seen occur independently different protoctistan for during food shortages the amoeba dictyostelium groups together colony that moves one new some these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other examples colonial organisation protista are volvocaceae such eudorina and volvox the latter which consists cells depending the only fraction which for one species cells asexually and around sexually however can often hard separate colonial protists from true multicellular the two concepts are not colonial protists have been dubbed pluricellular rather than multicellular this problem plagues most hypotheses how multicellularisation could have experimental evidence the evolution multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been replicated the evolution experiments using predation the selective pressure similar experiments can demonstrate the facultative induction advantages multicellularity allows organism exceed the size limits normally imposed diffusion single cells with increased size have decreased volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the this confers multicellular organisms with the competitive advantages increase also permits increasing complexity allowing the differentiation numerous cellular lineages within citation needed see also organogenesis embryogenesis bacterial colony
