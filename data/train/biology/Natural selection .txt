selection the gradual process which biological traits become either more less common population function the effect inherited traits the differential reproductive success organisms interacting with their key mechanism evolution the term natural was popularized charles darwin who intended compared with artificial selection now more commonly referred selective breeding variation exists within all populations this occurs partly because random mutations occur the genome individual and these mutations can passed throughout the lives their genomes interact with their environments cause variations the environment genome includes the molecular biology the other other populations species well the abiotic individuals with certain variants the trait may survive and reproduce more than individuals with less variants therefore the population factors that affect reproductive success are also issue that charles darwin developed his ideas sexual selection for natural selection acts the phenotype the observable characteristics but the genetic basis any phenotype that gives reproductive advantage may become more common population see allele frequency over this process can result populations that specialize for particular ecological niches and may eventually result the emergence new species other natural selection important process though not the only which evolution takes place within population natural selection can contrasted with artificial selection which humans intentionally choose specific traits although they may not always get what they natural selection there intentional other artificial selection teleological and natural selection not natural selection one the cornerstones modern biology the term was introduced darwin his influential book the origin species which natural selection was described analogous artificial selection process which animals and plants with traits considered desirable human breeders are systematically favored for the concept natural

camouflaging great tits natural variation occurs among the individuals any population many these differences not affect but some differences may improve the chances survival particular rabbit that runs faster than others may more likely escape from and algae that are more efficient extracting energy from sunlight will grow something that increases chances survival will often also include its reproductive however sometimes there off between survival and current ultimately what matters total lifetime reproduction the the peppered moth exists both light and dark colors the united kingdom but during the industrial revolution many the trees which the moths rested became blackened soot giving the colored moths advantage hiding from predators this gave colored moths better chance surviving produce colored and just fifty years from the first dark moth being nearly all the moths industrial manchester were the balance was reversed the effect the clean air act and the dark moths became rare demonstrating the influence natural selection peppered moth evolution the traits that give these individuals reproductive advantage are also that passed from parent then there will slightly higher proportion fast rabbits efficient algae the next this known differential reproduction even the reproductive advantage very over many generations any heritable advantage will become dominant the this way the natural environment organism selects for traits that confer reproductive causing gradual changes evolution this effect was first described and named charles the concept natural selection predates the understanding the mechanism heredity for all known life modern selection acts observable but the genetic genotype that the phenotype the result the genotype and the environment which the organism lives see genotype phenotype distinction this the link between natural selection and described the modern evolutionary synthesis although complete theory evolution also requires account how genetic variation arises the first place such mutation and sexual reproduction and includes other evolutionary mechanisms such genetic drift and gene flow natural selection appears the most important mechanism for creating complex adaptations nomenclature and usage the term natural selection has slightly different definitions different most often defined operate heritable because these are the traits that directly participate however natural selection blind the sense that changes phenotype physical and behavioral can give reproductive advantage regardless whether not the trait heritable non heritable traits can the result environmental factors the life experience the following primary usage the term often used refer both the evolutionary consequence blind selection and its sometimes helpful explicitly distinguish between mechanisms and its when this distinction scientists define natural specifically those mechanisms that contribute the selection individuals that without regard whether the basis the selection this sometimes referred phenotypic natural traits that cause greater reproductive success organism are said selected whereas those that reduce success are selected selection for trait may also result the selection other correlated traits that not themselves directly influence reproductive this may occur result pleiotropy gene linkage fitness darwin finches pagos islands species fitness the concept fitness central natural broad individuals that are more fit have better potential for the known phrase survival the fittest however with natural selection the precise meaning the term much more modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not how long organism but how successful organism lives half long others its but has twice many offspring surviving its genes will become more common the adult population the next though natural selection acts the effects chance mean that fitness can only really defined for the individuals within the fitness particular genotype corresponds the average effect all individuals with that very fitness genotypes cause their bearers have few offspring examples include many human genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis since fitness averaged also possible that favorable mutation arises individual that does not survive adulthood for unrelated fitness also depends crucially upon the conditions like sickle cell anemia may have low fitness the general human but because the sickle cell trait confers immunity from has high fitness value populations that have high malaria infection types selection natural selection can act any heritable phenotypic and selective pressure can produced any aspect the including sexual selection and competition with members the same other however this does not imply that natural selection always directional and results adaptive natural selection often results the maintenance the status quo eliminating less fit the unit selection can the individual can another level within the hierarchy biological such cells and kin groups there still debate about whether natural selection acts the level groups species produce adaptations that benefit non kin likewise there debate whether selection the molecular level prior gene mutations and fertilization the zygote should ascribed conventional natural selection because traditionally natural selection environmental and exterior force that acts upon phenotype typically after some science journalists distinguish gene selection from natural selection informally referencing selection mutations selection different level such the gene can result increase fitness for that while the same time reducing the fitness the individuals carrying that process called intragenomic conflict overall the combined effect all selection pressures various levels determines the overall fitness and hence the outcome natural natural selection occurs every life stage individual organism must survive until adulthood before can and selection those that reach this stage called viability selection many adults must compete with each other for mates via sexual and success this competition determines who will parent the next when individuals can reproduce more than longer survival the reproductive phase increases the number called survival selection the fecundity both females and males for giant sperm certain species drosophila can limited via fecundity the viability produced gametes can while intragenomic conflicts such meiotic drive between the haploid gametes can result gametic genic finally the union some combinations eggs and sperm might more compatible than this termed compatibility selection sexual selection sexual selection useful distinguish between ecological selection and sexual ecological selection covers any mechanism selection result the environment including kin selection competition and infanticide while sexual refers specifically competition for sexual selection can intrasexual cases competition among individuals the same sex intersexual cases where one sex controls reproductive access choosing among population available most intrasexual selection involves male competition and intersexual selection involves female choice suitable due the generally greater investment resources for female than male single however some species exhibit role reversed behavior which males that are most selective mate the known examples this pattern occur some fishes the family syngnathidae though likely examples have also been found amphibian and bird some features that are confined one sex only particular species can explained selection exercised the other sex the choice for the extravagant plumage some male similarly aggression between members the same sex sometimes associated with very distinctive such the antlers stags which are used combat with other more intrasexual selection often associated with sexual dimorphism including differences body size between males and females examples natural selection known example natural selection action the development antibiotic resistance microorganisms since the discovery penicillin antibiotics have been used fight bacterial diseases natural populations bacteria among their vast numbers individual considerable variation their genetic primarily the result when exposed most bacteria die but some may have mutations that make them slightly less the exposure antibiotics these individuals will survive the this selective elimination maladapted individuals from population natural these surviving bacteria will then reproduce producing the next due the elimination the maladapted individuals the past this population contains more bacteria that have some resistance against the the same new mutations contributing new genetic variation the existing genetic spontaneous mutations are very and advantageous mutations are even however populations bacteria are large enough that few individuals will have beneficial new mutation reduces their susceptibility these individuals are more likely survive when next confronted with that given enough time and repeated exposure the population resistant bacteria will this new changed population resistant bacteria optimally adapted the context evolved the same not necessarily optimally adapted any more the old antibiotic free the end result natural selection two populations that are both optimally adapted their specific while both perform substandard the other the widespread use and misuse antibiotics has resulted increased microbial resistance antibiotics clinical the point that the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus has been described superbug because the threat poses health and its relative invulnerability existing response strategies typically include the use stronger however new strains mrsa have recently emerged that are resistant even these this example what known evolutionary arms race which bacteria continue develop strains that are less susceptible while medical researchers continue develop new antibiotics that can kill similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance plants and arms races are not necessarily induced documented example involves the spread gene the butterfly hypolimnas bolina suppressing killing activity wolbachia bacteria parasites the island where the spread the gene known have occurred over period just five years evolution means natural selection evolution darwinism prerequisite for natural selection result adaptive evolution novel traits and the presence heritable genetic variation that results fitness genetic variation the result recombinations and alterations the karyotype the shape size and internal arrangement the chromosomes any these changes might have effect that highly advantageous highly but large effects are very the most changes the genetic material were considered neutral close neutral because they occurred noncoding dna resulted synonymous substitution however recent research suggests that many mutations coding dna have slight deleterious although both mutation rates and average fitness effects mutations are dependent the estimates from data humans have found that majority mutations are slightly peacock leucistic albinism unsuccessful competition for mates the definition individuals with greater fitness are more likely contribute offspring the next while individuals with lesser fitness are more likely die early fail alleles that average result greater fitness become more abundant the next while alleles that general reduce fitness become the selection forces remain the same for many beneficial alleles become more and more until they dominate the while alleles with lesser fitness every new mutations and combinations arise producing new spectrum therefore each new generation will enriched the increasing abundance alleles that contribute those traits that were favored enhancing these traits over successive some mutations occur called regulatory genes changes these can have large effects the phenotype the individual because they regulate the function many other most but not mutations regulatory genes result viable zygotes examples nonlethal regulatory mutations occur hox genes which can result cervical rib polydactyly increase the number fingers when such mutations result higher natural selection will favor these phenotypes and the novel trait will spread the polydactyly established traits are not traits that have high fitness one environmental context may much less fit environmental conditions the absence natural selection preserve such will become more variable and deteriorate over possibly resulting vestigial manifestation the also called evolutionary baggage many the apparently vestigial structure may retain limited may opted for other advantageous traits phenomenon known preadaptation famous example vestigial the eye the blind mole rat believed retain function photoperiod perception speciation speciation speciation requires selective which result reduced gene flow selective mating can the result geographic behavioral temporal for change the physical environment geographic isolation extrinsic would follow number change camouflage for number shift mating times one species deer shifts location and therefore changes its rut for number citation needed over these subgroups might diverge radically become different either because differences selection pressures the different because different mutations arise spontaneously the different because founder effects some potentially beneficial alleles present only one other two subgroups when they first become known mechanism speciation occurs via hybridization well documented plants and occasionally observed rich groups animals such cichlid fishes such mechanisms rapid speciation can reflect mechanism evolutionary change known punctuated equilibrium which suggests that evolutionary change and particular speciation typically happens quickly after interrupting long periods genetic changes within groups result increasing incompatibility between the genomes the two thus reducing gene flow between the gene flow will effectively cease when the distinctive mutations characterizing each subgroup become few two mutations can result each mutation has neutral positive effect fitness when they occur but negative effect when they occur then fixation these genes the respective subgroups will lead two reproductively isolated according the biological species these will two different historical development history evolutionary thought inception theory development theory charles darwin darwinian theories several ancient philosophers expressed the idea that nature produces huge variety randomly and that only those creatures that manage provide for themselves and reproduce successfully well known examples include empedocles and his intellectual the roman poet lucretius empedocles idea that organisms arose entirely the incidental workings causes such heat and cold was criticized aristotle book physics posited natural teleology its believed that form was achieved for citing the regularity heredity species nevertheless acceded that new types monstrosities can occur very rare instances generation animals book quoted origin aristotle considered whether different might have appeared but only the useful forms what hinders the different parts the from having this merely accidental relation the for grow the front ones adapted for and the grinders and serviceable for masticating the since they were not made for the sake but was the result and like manner other parts which there appears exist adaptation wheresoever therefore all things together that all the parts one happened like they were made for the sake these were having been appropriately constituted internal and whatsoever things were not thus perished and still physicae auscultationes but rejected this possibility the next yet impossible that this should the true for teeth and all other natural things either invariably normally come about given but not one the results chance spontaneity this not ascribe chance mere coincidence the frequency rain but frequent rain summer nor heat the but only have agreed that things are either the result coincidence for and these cannot the result coincidence follows that they must for and that such things are all due nature even the champions the theory which before would therefore action for end present things which come and are physicae auscultationes the struggle for existence was later described islamic writer jahiz the who argued that environmental factors influence animals develop new characteristics ensure verification needed the classical arguments were reintroduced the century pierre louis maupertuis and including charles grandfather erasmus darwin while these forerunners had influence they later had little influence the trajectory evolutionary thought after charles until the early the prevailing view western societies was that differences between individuals species were uninteresting departures from their platonic idealism created kinds however the theory uniformitarianism geology promoted the idea that weak forces could act continuously over long periods time produce radical changes the the success this theory raised awareness the vast scale geological time and made plausible the idea that virtually imperceptible changes successive generations could produce consequences the scale differences between early century evolutionists such jean baptiste lamarck suggested the inheritance acquired characteristics mechanism for evolutionary adaptive traits acquired organism during its lifetime could inherited that eventually causing transmutation species this theory has come known lamarckism and was influence the genetic ideas the stalinist soviet biologist trofim lysenko between and zoologist edward blyth also contributed specifically the area artificial selection and how similar process occurs nature see edward natural selection charles darwin showed his high regards for ideas the first chapter variation the origin species that blyth whose from his large and varied stores should value more than that almost any darwin theory charles darwin set out his theory evolution natural selection explanation for adaptation and defined natural selection the principle which each slight variation the concept was simple but individuals best adapted their environments are more likely survive and long there some variation between there will inevitable selection individuals with the most advantageous the variations are then differential reproductive success will lead progressive evolution particular populations and populations that evolve sufficiently different eventually become different darwin ideas were inspired the observations that had made the beagle voyage and the work political the reverend thomas malthus who essay the principle population noted that population increases whereas the food supply grows only arithmetically thus inevitable limitations resources would have demographic leading struggle for when darwin read malthus was already primed his work naturalist appreciate the struggle for nature and struck him that population outgrew favourable variations would tend and unfavourable ones the result this would the formation new here own summary the which can found the fourth chapter the origin once had his theory which darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining evidence his prime before making his idea was the process writing his big present his researches when the naturalist alfred russel wallace independently conceived the principle and described essay sent darwin forward charles lyell lyell and joseph dalton hooker decided without present his essay together with unpublished writings that darwin had sent fellow and the tendency species form and the perpetuation varieties and species natural means selection was read the linnean society announcing discovery the principle july darwin published detailed account his evidence and conclusions the origin species the edition darwin acknowledged that others notable one being william charles wells and patrick matthew had proposed similar but had neither developed them nor presented them notable scientific darwin thought natural selection analogy how farmers select crops livestock for which called artificial his early manuscripts referred nature which would the the other mechanisms evolution such evolution genetic drift were not yet explicitly and darwin believed that selection was likely only part the convinced that has been the but not exclusive means letter charles lyell september darwin regretted the use the term natural preferring the term natural for darwin and his natural selection was essence synonymous with evolution natural after the publication the origin species educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred some however natural selection remained controversial partly because was perceived too weak explain the range observed characteristics living and partly because even supporters evolution balked its unguided and progressive response that has been characterized the single most significant impediment the however some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural after reading herbert spencer introduced the term survival the fittest which became popular summary the the fifth edition the origin species published included phrase alternative natural with credit but the expression often used herbert the survival the more and sometimes equally although the phrase still often used modern biologists avoid because tautological fittest read mean functionally and applied individuals rather than considered averaged quantity over modern evolutionary synthesis modern evolutionary synthesis natural selection relies crucially the idea but developed before the basic concepts although the austrian monk gregor mendel the father modern was contemporary his work would lie obscurity until the early only after the century integration theory evolution with complex statistical appreciation gregor laws inheritance did scientists generally come accept natural the work ronald fisher who developed the required mathematical language and wrote the genetical theory natural selection haldane who introduced the concept the cost natural sewall wright who elucidated the nature selection and theodosius dobzhansky who established the idea that creating genetic supplied the raw material for natural see genetics and the origin species william hamilton who conceived kin ernst mayr who recognised the key importance reproductive isolation for see systematics and the origin species and many others together formed the modern evolutionary this synthesis cemented natural selection the foundation evolutionary where remains impact the idea darwin along with those adam smith and karl marx had profound influence century perhaps the most radical claim the theory evolution through natural selection that elaborately constructed different from each and dependent each other complex evolved from the simplest forms life few simple this claim inspired some most ardent and provoked the most profound the radicalism natural according stephen jay gould lay its power dethrone some the deepest and most traditional comforts western challenged standing beliefs such concepts special and exalted place for humans the natural world and benevolent creator whose intentions were reflected order and the words the philosopher daniel dennett dangerous evolution natural selection universal which cannot kept restricted any vessel soon leaks working its way into wider thus the last the concept natural selection has spread from evolutionary biology into virtually all including evolutionary computation quantum darwinism evolutionary economics evolutionary epistemology evolutionary psychology and cosmological natural selection this unlimited applicability has been called universal darwinism emergence natural selection how life originated remains unresolved problem prominent idea that life first appeared the form short replicating rna polymers see rna world hypothesis this may have come into existence when rna chains first experienced the basic conceived darwin for natural selection these conditions heritability variation type and competition for limited fitness early rna replicator its per capita rate would likely have been function adaptive capacities that were intrinsic determined the nucleotide sequence and the availability the three primary adaptive capacities could logically have the capacity replicate with moderate fidelity giving rise both heritability and variation the capacity avoid and the capacity acquire and process these capacities would have been determined initially the folded configurations including those configurations with ribozyme activity the rna replicators that would have been encoded their individual nucleotide competitive success among different rna replicators would have depended the relative values their adaptive cell and molecular biology the wilhelm roux founder modern wrote book entitled der kampf der teile the struggle parts the which suggested that the development organism results from darwinian competition between the parts the occurring all from molecules recent modern version this theory has been proposed jean jacques kupiec according this cellular darwinism stochasticity the molecular level generates diversity cell types whereas cell interactions impose characteristic order the developing social and psychological theory the social implications the theory evolution natural selection also became the source continuing friedrich engels german political philosopher and originator the ideology communism wrote that darwin did not know what bitter satire wrote mankind when showed that free the struggle for which the economists celebrate the highest historical the normal state the animal interpretation natural selection necessarily leading increasing intelligence and was used justification for colonialism and policies eugenics well broader sociopolitical positions now described social darwinism konrad lorenz won the nobel prize physiology medicine for his analysis animal behavior terms the role natural selection particularly group however germany writings that subsequently used the theory justification for policies the nazi state wrote selection for heroism and social must accomplished some human default selective not ruined induced the racial idea the basis our state has already accomplished much this others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve mechanisms that are analogous those that apply evolution more work among anthropologists and psychologists has led the development sociobiology and later evolutionary psychology field that attempts explain features human psychology terms adaptation the ancestral the most prominent such notably advanced the early work noam chomsky and later steven pinker the hypothesis that the human brain adapted acquire the grammatical rules natural language other aspects human behavior and social from specific cultural norms such incest avoidance broader patterns such gender roles have been hypothesized have similar origins adaptations the early environment which modern humans analogy the action natural selection the concept memes units cultural equivalents genes undergoing selection and recombination has first described this form richard dawkins and subsequently expanded upon philosophers such daniel dennett explanations for complex cultural including human consciousness information and systems theory alfred lotka proposed that natural selection might understood physical principle that could described terms the use energy concept that was later developed howard odum the maximum power principle whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate useful energy such concepts are sometimes relevant the study applied thermodynamics the principles natural selection have inspired variety computational such soft artificial life that simulate selective processes and can highly efficient entities environment defined specified fitness function for class heuristic optimization algorithms known genetic algorithms pioneered john holland the and expanded upon david goldberg identify optimal solutions simulated reproduction and mutation population solutions defined initial probability distribution such algorithms are particularly useful when applied problems whose solution landscape very rough has many local genetic basis natural selection the idea natural selection predates the understanding now have much better idea the biology underlying which the basis natural genotype and phenotype genotype phenotype distinction natural selection acts physical phenotype determined genetic and the environment which the organism often natural selection acts specific traits and the terms phenotype and genotype are used narrowly indicate these specific when different organisms population possess different versions gene for certain each these versions known this genetic variation that underlies phenotypic typical example that certain combinations genes for eye color humans for give rise the phenotype blue the other when all the organisms population share the same allele for particular and this state stable over the allele said fixed that some traits are governed only single but most traits are influenced the interactions many variation one the many genes that contributes trait may have only small effect the together these genes can produce continuum possible phenotypic directionality selection directional selection when some component trait selection will alter the frequencies the different variants the gene that produces the variants the selection can divided into three the basis its effect allele directional selection occurs when certain allele has greater fitness than resulting increase its this process can continue until the allele fixed and the entire population shares the fitter directional selection that illustrated the antibiotic resistance example above far more common stabilizing selection which commonly confused with purifying selection which lowers the frequency alleles that have deleterious effect the phenotype that produce organisms lower this process can continue until the allele eliminated from the purifying selection results functional genetic such protein coding genes regulatory sequences being conserved over time due selective pressure against deleterious finally number forms balancing selection exist which not result but maintain allele intermediate frequencies this can occur diploid species that those that have homologous pairs chromosomes when heterozygote individuals who have different alleles each chromosome single genetic locus have higher fitness than homozygote individuals that have two the same this called heterozygote advantage which the known example the malarial resistance observed heterozygous humans who carry only one copy the gene for sickle cell anemia maintenance allelic variation can also occur through disruptive diversifying selection which favors genotypes that depart from the average either direction that the opposite and can result bimodal distribution trait finally balancing selection can occur through frequency dependent selection where the fitness one particular phenotype depends the distribution other phenotypes the the principles game theory have been applied understand the fitness distributions these particularly the study kin selection and the evolution reciprocal altruism selection and genetic variation portion all genetic variation functionally neutral that produces phenotypic effect significant difference the hypothesis that this variation accounts for large fraction observed genetic diversity known the neutral theory molecular evolution and was originated motoo kimura when genetic variation does not result differences selection cannot directly affect the frequency such the genetic variation those sites will higher than sites where variation does influence however after period with new the genetic variation these sites will eliminated due genetic drift mutation selection balance natural selection results the reduction genetic variation through the elimination maladapted individuals and consequently the mutations that caused the the same new mutations resulting mutation selection balance the exact outcome the two processes depends both the rate which new mutations occur and the strength the natural which function how unfavorable the mutation proves consequently changes the mutation rate the selection pressure will result different selection genetic linkage genetic linkage occurs when the loci two alleles are linked close proximity each other the during the formation gametes recombination the genetic material results reshuffling the however the chance that such reshuffle occurs between two alleles depends the distance between those the closer the alleles are each the less likely that such reshuffle will consequently when selection targets one this automatically results selection the other allele through this selection can have strong influence patterns variation the selective sweeps occur when allele becomes more common population result positive the prevalence one allele linked alleles can also become more whether they are neutral even slightly this called genetic hitchhiking strong selective sweep results region the genome where the positively selected haplotype the allele and its are essence the only ones that exist the whether selective sweep has occurred not can investigated measuring linkage disequilibrium whether given haplotype overrepresented the normally genetic recombination results reshuffling the different alleles within and none the haplotypes will dominate the however during selective selection for specific allele will also result selection neighboring therefore the presence block strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate that there has been selective sweep near the center the and this can used identify sites recently under background selection the opposite selective specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying linked variation will tend weeded out along with producing region the genome low overall because background selection result deleterious new which can occur randomly any does not produce clear blocks linkage although with low recombination can still lead slightly
