biology	nervous system navigation search nervous system latin systema nervosum neuroscience portal the nervous system the part animal body that coordinates its voluntary and involuntary actions and transmits signals between different parts its nervous tissue first arose wormlike organisms about million years most animal species consists two main the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system the cns contains the brain and spinal cord the pns consists mainly nerves which are enclosed bundles the long fibers axons that connect the cns every other part the the pns includes motor neurons mediating voluntary the autonomic nervous system comprising the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system which regulate involuntary and the enteric nervous system which functions control the gastrointestinal system the cellular the nervous system defined the presence special type called the neuron also known nerve neurons have special structures that allow them send signals rapidly and precisely other they send these signals the form electrochemical waves traveling along thin fibers called axons which cause chemicals called neurotransmitters released junctions called synapses cell that receives synaptic signal from neuron may inhibited otherwise the connections between neurons can form neural circuits and also neural networks that generate perception the world and determine its along with the nervous system contains other specialized cells called glial cells simply which provide structural and metabolic nervous systems are found most multicellular but vary greatly the only multicellular animals that have nervous system all are sponges placozoans and mesozoans which have very simple body the nervous systems the radially symmetric organisms the ctenophores comb and cnidarians which include anemones hydras corals and jellyfish consist diffuse nerve net all other animal with the exception few types have nervous system containing central cord two cords running parallel and nerves radiating from the brain and central the size the nervous system ranges from few hundred cells the simplest around billion cells the central nervous system functions send signals from one cell from one part the body others and receive malfunction the nervous system can occur result genetic physical damage due trauma infection simply the medical specialty neurology studies disorders the nervous system and looks for interventions that can prevent treat the peripheral nervous the most common problem the failure nerve which can due different causes including diabetic neuropathy and demyelinating disorders such multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis neuroscience the field science that focuses the study the nervous contents structure cells neurons glial cells anatomy vertebrates comparative anatomy and evolution neural precursors sponges radiata bilateria worms arthropods identified neurons function neurons and synapses neural circuits and systems reflexes and other response circuits intrinsic pattern generation development pathology references external links structure the nervous system derives its name from which are cylindrical bundles fibers the axons neurons that emanate from the brain and spinal cord and branch repeatedly innervate every part the nerves are large enough have been recognized the ancient greeks and but their internal structure was not understood until became possible examine them using microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily along with different membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles the neurons that give rise nerves not lie entirely within the nerves their cell bodies reside within the spinal peripheral all animals more advanced than sponges have nervous however even unicellular and animals such slime molds have cell signalling mechanisms that are precursors those radially symmetric animals such the jellyfish and the nervous system consists nerve net diffuse network isolated bilaterian animals which make the great majority existing the nervous system has common structure that originated early the ediacaran period over million years cells the nervous system contains two main categories types neurons and glial cells neurons dendrite soma axon nucleus node ranvier axon terminal schwann cell myelin sheath the nervous system defined the presence special type the neuron sometimes called neurone nerve neurons can distinguished from other cells number but their most fundamental property that they communicate with other cells via synapses which are membrane junctions containing molecular machinery that allows rapid transmission either electrical many types neuron possess axon protoplasmic protrusion that can extend distant parts the body and make thousands synaptic axons frequently travel through the body bundles called even the nervous system single species such hundreds different types neurons with wide variety morphologies and these include sensory neurons that transmute physical stimuli such light and sound into neural and motor neurons that transmute neural signals into activation muscles however many species the great majority neurons receive all their input from other neurons and send their output other glial cells glial cells named from the greek for glue are neuronal cells that provide support and maintain homeostasis form myelin and participate signal transmission the nervous the human brain estimated that the total number glia roughly equals the number although the proportions vary different brain among the most important functions glial cells are support neurons and hold them supply nutrients insulate neurons destroy pathogens and remove dead and provide guidance cues directing the axons neurons their very important type glial cell oligodendrocytes the central nervous and schwann cells the peripheral nervous generates layers fatty substance called myelin that wraps around axons and provides electrical insulation which allows them transmit action potentials much more rapidly and anatomy vertebrates list nerves the human body the nervous system vertebrates including divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system the the major and consists the brain and the spinal cord the spinal canal contains the spinal while the head contains the the cns enclosed and protected the meninges layered system including leathery outer layer called the dura mater the brain also protected the and the spinal cord the vertebrae the peripheral nervous system collective term for the nervous system structures that not lie within the the large majority the axon bundles called nerves are considered belong the even when the cell bodies the neurons which they belong reside within the brain spinal the pns divided into somatic and visceral parts the somatic part consists the nerves that innervate the joints and the cell bodies somatic sensory neurons lie dorsal root ganglia the spinal the visceral also known the autonomic nervous contains neurons that innervate the internal blood and the autonomic nervous system itself consists two the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system some authors also include sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie the periphery for senses such part the others however omit the vertebrate nervous system can also divided into areas called grey matter gray american and white matter grey matter which only grey preserved and better described pink light brown living contains high proportion cell bodies white matter composed mainly myelinated axons and takes its color from the white matter includes all the and much the interior the brain and spinal grey matter found clusters neurons the brain and spinal and cortical layers that line their there anatomical convention that cluster neurons the brain spinal cord called nucleus whereas cluster neurons the periphery called ganglion there however few exceptions this notably including the part the forebrain called the basal ganglia comparative anatomy and evolution evolution nervous systems neural precursors sponges sponges have cells connected each other synaptic junctions that and therefore nervous they however have homologs many genes that play key roles synaptic recent studies have shown that sponge cells express group proteins that cluster together form structure resembling postsynaptic density the receiving part however the function this structure currently although sponge cells not show synaptic they communicate with each other via calcium waves and other which mediate some simple actions such body radiata jellyfish comb jellies and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather than central nervous most jellyfish the nerve net spread more less evenly across the comb jellies concentrated near the the nerve nets consist sensory which pick tactile and visual motor which can activate contractions the body and intermediate which detect patterns activity the sensory neurons send signals groups motor some cases groups intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia the development the nervous system radiata relatively unlike bilaterians radiata only have two primordial cell endoderm and ectoderm neurons are generated from special set ectodermal precursor which also serve precursors for every other ectodermal cell bilateria the vast majority existing animals are bilaterians meaning animals with left and right sides that are approximate mirror images each all bilateria are thought have descended from common wormlike ancestor that appeared the ediacaran million years the fundamental bilaterian body form tube with hollow gut cavity running from mouth and nerve cord with enlargement ganglion for each body with especially large ganglion the called the brain even including show the segmented bilaterian body plan the level the nervous the spinal cord contains series segmental each giving rise motor and sensory nerves that innervate portion the body surface and underlying the the layout the innervation pattern but the trunk gives rise series narrow the top three segments belong the giving rise the midbrain and bilaterians can based events that occur very early embryonic into two groups superphyla called protostomes and deuterostomes deuterostomes include vertebrates well echinoderms hemichordates mainly acorn and xenoturbellidans protostomes the more diverse include arthropods molluscs and numerous types there basic difference between the two groups the placement the nervous system within the protostomes possess nerve cord the ventral usually side the whereas deuterostomes the nerve cord the dorsal usually side numerous aspects the body are inverted between the two including the expression patterns several genes that show ventral most anatomists now consider that the bodies protostomes and deuterostomes are flipped with respect each hypothesis that was first proposed geoffroy hilaire for insects comparison thus for have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline the while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal worms this factual accuracy disputed may top bottom worms are the simplest bilaterian and reveal the basic structure the bilaterian nervous system the most straightforward earthworms have dual nerve cords running along the length the body and merging the tail and the these nerve cords are connected transverse nerves like the rungs these transverse nerves help coordinate the two sides the two ganglia the head end function similar simple photoreceptors the eyespots provide sensory information light and the nervous system one very small the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has been completely mapped out connectome including its every neuron and its cellular lineage has been recorded and not the neural connections are this the nervous system sexually dimorphic the nervous systems the two males and female hermaphrodites have different numbers neurons and groups neurons that perform specific elegans males have exactly neurons while hermaphrodites have exactly neurons arthropods arthropods such insects and crustaceans have nervous system made series ganglia connected ventral nerve cord made two parallel connectives running along the length the belly typically each body segment has one ganglion each though some ganglia are fused form the brain and other large the head segment contains the also known the supraesophageal ganglion the insect nervous system the brain anatomically divided into the protocerebrum deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum immediately behind the brain the subesophageal ganglion which composed three pairs fused controls the mouthparts the salivary glands and certain muscles many arthropods have developed sensory organs including compound eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction and pheromone sensation the sensory information from these organs processed the many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned the edge the brain and are electrically the cell bodies serve only provide metabolic support and not participate protoplasmic fiber runs from the cell body and branches with some parts transmitting signals and other parts receiving thus most parts the insect brain have passive cell bodies arranged around the while the neural signal processing takes place tangle protoplasmic fibers called neuropil the identified neurons neuron called identified has properties that distinguish from every other neuron the same properties such neurotransmitter gene expression and and every individual organism belonging the same species has one and only one neuron with the same set vertebrate nervous systems very few neurons are identified this there are believed but simpler nervous some all neurons may thus the roundworm elegans whose nervous system the most thoroughly described any every neuron the body uniquely with the same location and the same connections every individual one notable consequence this fact that the form the elegans nervous system completely specified the with dependent the brains many molluscs and insects also contain substantial numbers identified the best known identified neurons are the gigantic mauthner cells every fish has two mauthner located the bottom part the one the left side and one the each mauthner cell has axon that crosses innervating neurons the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal making numerous connections the synapses generated mauthner cell are powerful that single action potential gives rise major behavioral within milliseconds the fish curves its body into shape then thereby propelling itself rapidly functionally this fast escape triggered most easily strong sound wave pressure wave impinging the lateral line organ the mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons there are about more including pairs mauthner cell each spinal segmental although mauthner cell capable bringing about escape response the context ordinary behavior other types cells usually contribute shaping the amplitude and direction the mauthner cells have been described command neurons command neuron special type identified defined neuron that capable driving specific behavior such neurons appear most commonly the fast escape systems various the squid giant axon and squid giant synapse used for pioneering experiments neurophysiology because their enormous both participate the fast escape circuit the the concept command neuron however become because studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared fit the description were really only capable evoking response limited set function the most basic the function the nervous system send signals from one cell from one part the body there are multiple ways that cell can send signals other one releasing chemicals called hormones into the internal that they can diffuse distant contrast this broadcast mode the nervous system provides signals neurons project their axons specific target areas and make synaptic connections with specific target thus neural signaling capable much higher level specificity than hormonal also much the fastest nerve signals travel speeds that exceed meters per more integrative the primary function the nervous system control the does this extracting information from the environment using sensory sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous processing the information determine appropriate and sending output signals muscles glands activate the the evolution complex nervous system has made possible for various animal species have advanced perception abilities such complex social rapid coordination organ and integrated processing concurrent the sophistication the nervous system makes possible have abstract representation transmission and many other features human society that would not exist without the human neurons and synapses action potential axon neuron synapse neurotransmitter most neurons send signals via their axons although some types are capable dendrite the types neurons called amacrine cells have and communicate only via their neural signals propagate along axon the form electrochemical waves called action potentials which produce cell signals points where axon terminals make synaptic contact with other synapses may electrical electrical synapses make direct electrical connections between but chemical synapses are much more and much more diverse chemical the cell that sends signals called and the cell that receives signals called both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full molecular machinery that carries out the signalling the presynaptic area contains large numbers tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles packed with neurotransmitter chemicals when the presynaptic terminal electrically array molecules embedded the membrane are and cause the contents the vesicles released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic called the synaptic cleft the neurotransmitter then binds receptors embedded the postsynaptic causing them enter activated depending the type the resulting effect the postsynaptic cell may inhibitory modulatory more complex for release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine synaptic contact between motor neuron and muscle cell induces rapid contraction the muscle the entire synaptic transmission process takes only fraction although the effects the postsynaptic cell may last much longer even cases where the synaptic signal leads the formation memory trace chemical synapse postsynaptic density gated channel synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter transporter receptor neurotransmitter axon terminal synaptic cleft dendrite there are literally hundreds different types there are over hundred known and many them have multiple types many synapses use more than one common arrangement for synapse use one acting molecule neurotransmitter such glutamate gaba along with one more peptide neurotransmitters that play acting modulatory molecular neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems when chemically gated ion channel forms passage that allow specific types ion flow across the depending the type the effect the target cell may excitatory when second messenger system starts cascade molecular interactions inside the target which may ultimately produce wide variety complex such increasing decreasing the sensitivity the cell even altering gene transcription according rule called dale principle which has only few known neuron releases the same neurotransmitters all its this does not though that neuron exerts the same effect all its because the effect synapse depends not the but the receptors that because different targets can and frequently use different types possible for neuron have excitatory effects one set target inhibitory effects and complex modulatory effects others nevertheless happens that the two most widely used glutamate and gaba each have largely consistent glutamate has several widely occurring types but all them are excitatory similarly gaba has several widely occurring receptor but all them are because this glutamatergic cells are frequently referred excitatory and gabaergic cells inhibitory strictly speaking this abuse the receptors that are excitatory and not the but commonly seen even scholarly one very important subset synapses are capable forming memory traces means lasting dependent changes synaptic the known form neural memory process called long term potentiation abbreviated which operates synapses that use the neurotransmitter glutamate acting special type receptor known the nmda receptor the nmda receptor has associative property the two cells involved the synapse are both activated approximately the same channel opens that permits calcium flow into the target the calcium entry initiates second messenger cascade that ultimately leads increase the number glutamate receptors the target thereby increasing the effective strength the this change strength can last for weeks since the discovery ltp many other types synaptic memory traces have been involving increases decreases synaptic strength that are induced varying and last for variable periods the reward system that reinforces desired behaviour for depends variant form ltp that conditioned extra input coming from signalling pathway that uses dopamine all these forms synaptic taken give rise neural plasticity that capability for the nervous system adapt itself variations the neural circuits and systems the basic neuronal function sending signals other cells includes capability for neurons exchange signals with each networks formed interconnected groups neurons are capable wide variety including feature pattern generation and and there are seen countless types information processing warren mcculloch and walter pitts showed that even artificial neural networks formed from greatly simplified mathematical abstraction neuron are capable universal computation ren descartes treatise man for many years the predominant view the function the nervous system was response this neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory producing signals that propagate through chains connections the spinal cord and giving rise eventually activation motor neurons and thereby muscle overt descartes believed that all the behaviors and most the behaviors could explained terms response although also believed that higher cognitive functions such language were not capable being explained charles sherrington his influential book the integrative action the nervous system developed the concept response mechanisms much more and behaviorism the school thought that dominated psychology through the middle the attempted explain every aspect human behavior response however experimental studies electrophysiology beginning the early century and reaching high productivity the showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns activity without requiring external neurons were found capable producing regular sequences action sequences even complete when intrinsically active neurons are connected each other complex the possibilities for generating intricate temporal patterns become far more modern conception views the function the nervous system partly terms response and partly terms intrinsically generated activity both types activity interact with each other generate the full repertoire reflexes and other response circuits the simplest type neural circuit reflex which begins with sensory input and ends with motor passing through sequence neurons connected series this can shown the withdrawal causing hand jerk back after hot stove the circuit begins with sensory receptors the skin that are activated harmful levels special type molecular structure embedded the membrane causes heat change the electrical field across the the change electrical potential large enough pass the given evokes action which transmitted along the axon the receptor into the spinal there the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other some which project send axonal the same region the spinal others projecting into the one target set spinal interneurons that project motor neurons controlling the arm the interneurons excite the motor and the excitation strong some the motor neurons generate action which travel down their axons the point where they make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle the excitatory signals induce contraction the muscle which causes the joint angles the arm pulling the arm this straightforward schema subject numerous although for the simplest reflexes there are short neural paths from sensory neuron motor there are also other nearby neurons that participate the circuit and modulate the furthermore there are projections from the brain the spinal cord that are capable enhancing inhibiting the although the simplest reflexes may mediated circuits lying entirely within the spinal more complex responses rely signal processing the for when object the periphery the visual field and person looks toward many stages signal processing are the initial sensory the retina the and the final motor the oculomotor nuclei the brain are not all that different from those simple but the intermediate stages are completely instead one two step chain the visual signals pass through perhaps dozen stages involving the cerebral basal superior cerebellum and several brainstem these areas perform processing functions that include feature detection perceptual analysis memory recall decision making and motor feature detection the ability extract biologically relevant information from combinations sensory the visual system for sensory receptors the retina the eye are only individually capable detecting points the outside second level visual neurons receive input from groups primary higher level neurons receive input from groups level and forming hierarchy processing each important information extracted from the signal ensemble and unimportant information the end the input signals representing points have been transformed into neural representation objects the surrounding world and their the most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside the but complex feature extraction also takes place the spinal cord and peripheral sensory organs such the intrinsic pattern generation although response mechanisms are the easiest the nervous system also capable controlling the body ways that not require external means internally generated rhythms because the variety sensitive ion channels that can embedded the membrane many types neurons are even generating rhythmic sequences action rhythmic alternations between rate bursting and when neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected each other excitatory inhibitory the resulting networks are capable wide variety dynamical including attractor dynamics periodicity and even chaos network neurons that uses its internal structure generate temporally structured without requiring corresponding temporally structured called central pattern generator internal pattern generation operates wide range time from milliseconds hours one the most important types temporal pattern circadian rhythmicity that rhythmicity with period approximately hours all animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations neural which control circadian alternations behavior such the wake experimental studies dating from the have shown that circadian rhythms are generated genetic consisting special set genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course the animals diverse insects and vertebrates share similar genetic clock the circadian clock influenced light but continues operate even when light levels are held constant and other external day cues are the clock genes are expressed many parts the nervous system well many peripheral but mammals all these tissue are kept synchrony signals that emanate from master timekeeper tiny part the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus development landmarks embryonic neural development include the birth and differentiation neurons from stem cell precursors the migration immature neurons from their birthplaces the embryo their final outgrowth axons from neurons and guidance the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic the generation synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic and finally the lifelong changes synapses which are thought underlie learning and all bilaterian animals early stage development form gastrula which with one end called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole the gastrula has the shape disk with three layers inner layer called the endoderm which gives rise the lining most internal middle layer called the mesoderm which gives rise the bones and and outer layer called the ectoderm which gives rise the skin and nervous the first sign the nervous system the appearance thin strip cells along the center the called the neural plate the inner portion the neural plate along the destined become the central nervous system the outer portion the peripheral nervous system development fold called the neural groove appears along the this fold and then closes the this point the future cns appears cylindrical structure called the neural tube whereas the future pns appears two strips tissue called the neural crest running lengthwise above the neural the sequence stages from neural plate neural tube and neural crest known neurulation the early set famous experiments hans spemann and hilde mangold showed that the formation nervous tissue induced signals from group mesodermal cells called the organizer region for though the nature the induction process defeated every attempt figure until finally was resolved genetic approaches the induction neural tissue requires inhibition the gene for called bone morphogenetic protein specifically the protein bmp appears two proteins called noggin and chordin both secreted the are capable inhibiting and thereby inducing ectoderm turn into neural appears that similar molecular mechanism involved for widely disparate types including arthropods well some however another type molecule called fibroblast growth factor fgf may also play important role induction neural tissues causes formation neural precursor called neuroblasts neuroblasts divide that one product ganglion mother and the other gmc divides give rise either pair neurons pair glial neuroblast capable generating indefinite number neurons shown study one factor common all bilateral organisms including family secreted signaling molecules called neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival neurons zhu identified the first neurotrophin found flies dnt shares structural similarity with all known neurotrophins and key factor the fate neurons drosophila because neurotrophins have now been identified both vertebrate and this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were present ancestor common bilateral organisms and may represent common mechanism for nervous system pathology neurology psychiatry the central nervous system protected major physical and chemical physically the brain and spinal cord are surrounded tough meningeal membranes and enclosed the bones the skull and spinal vertebrae which combine form strong physical chemically the brain and spinal cord are isolated the called blood brain barrier which prevents most types chemicals from moving from the bloodstream into the interior the these protections make the cns less susceptible many ways than the the flip however that damage the cns tends have more serious although nerves tend lie deep under the skin except few places such the ulnar nerve near the elbow they are still relatively exposed physical which can cause loss loss muscle damage nerves can also caused swelling bruises places where nerve passes through tight bony happens carpal tunnel syndrome nerve completely will often regenerate but for long nerves this process may take months addition physical peripheral neuropathy may caused many other medical including genetic metabolic conditions such diabetes inflammatory conditions such guillain syndrome vitamin infectious diseases such leprosy shingles poisoning toxins such heavy many cases have cause that can and are referred idiopathic also possible for nerves lose function resulting numbness common causes include mechanical drop chemical interactions with local anesthetic drugs such lidocaine physical damage the spinal cord may result loss sensation movement injury the spine produces nothing worse than the symptoms may but nerve fibers the spine are actually the loss function usually experimental studies have shown that spinal nerve fibers attempt regrow the same way nerve but the spinal tissue destruction usually produces scar tissue that cannot penetrated the regrowing
