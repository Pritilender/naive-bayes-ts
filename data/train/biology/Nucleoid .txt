nucleoid navigation search the nucleoid meaning nucleus like shaped region within the cell prokaryote that contains all most the genetic material contrast the nucleus eukaryotic cell not surrounded nuclear membrane the genome prokaryotic organisms generally double stranded piece dna which multiple copies may exist any the length genome widely but generally least few million base all cellular length the dna molecules bacterial and archaeal chromosomes very large compared the dimensions the and the genomic dna molecules must compacted contents visualization composition dna damage and repair see also references visualization the nucleoid can clearly visualized electron micrograph high magnification where although its appearance may clearly visible against the cytosol sometimes even strands what thought dna are staining with the feulgen stain which specifically stains the nucleoid can also seen under light the intercalating stains dapi and ethidium bromide are widely used for fluorescence microscopy composition experimental evidence suggests that the nucleoid largely composed about with small amount rna and protein the latter two constituents are likely mainly messenger rna and the transcription factor proteins found regulating the bacterial proteins that carry out the dynamic spatial organization the nucleic acid are known nucleoid proteins associated proteins and are distinct from histones eukaryotic contrast the binding proteins the nucleoid not form which dna wrapped around protein instead these proteins often use other mechanisms promote compaction such dna the most studied naps are fis cbpa dps that organize the genome driving events such dna bridging and these proteins can form clusters like order locally compact specific genomic scattered throughout the chromosome fis and they seem involved also coordinating transcription spatially sequestering specific genes and participating their dna damage and repair changes the structure the nucleoid bacteria and archaea are observed after exposure dna damaging the nucleoids the bacteria bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli both become significantly more compact after formation the compact structure coli requires reca activation through specific dna the reca protein plays key role homologous recombinational repair dna similar subtilis and coli above exposure the archaeon haloferax volcanii stresses that damage dna cause compaction and reorganization the compaction depends the protein complex that catalyzes early step homologous recombinational repair strand breaks delmas proposed that nucleoid compaction part dna damage response that accelerates cell recovery helping dna repair proteins locate and facilitating the search for intact dna sequences during homologous see also cell nucleus plasmid homologous recombination dna repair
