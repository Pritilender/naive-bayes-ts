life cloning and synthetic see also references external links etymology the term organism from greek organismos from organon implement tool organ sense first appeared the english language and took its current definition oxford english dictionary directly related the term organization there long tradition defining organisms organizing there has been great deal recent controversy about the best way define the organism and indeed about whether not such definition several contributions are responses the suggestion that the category organism may well not adequate semantics the word organism may broadly defined assembly molecules functioning more less stable whole that exhibits the properties life however many sources propose definitions that exclude viruses and theoretically possible made non organic life forms viruses are dependent the biochemical machinery host cell for chambers online reference provides broad any living such animal fungus capable growth and multicellular organism usually describes the whole hierarchical assemblage systems for example circulatory digestive reproductive themselves collections organs these collections which are themselves made cells some plants and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans individual cells are totipotent superorganism organism consisting many individuals working together single functional social unit non cellular life non cellular life viruses are not typically considered organisms because they are incapable autonomous reproduction growth metabolism this controversy problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable independent survival but not independent metabolism and and live obligatory intracellular although viruses have few enzymes and molecules characteristic living they have metabolism their own and cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds that form naturally this rules out autonomous reproduction and they can only passively replicated the machinery the host cell this sense they are similar inanimate while viruses sustain independent and thus are usually not accounted they have their own genes and they evolve similar mechanisms which organisms the most common argument support viruses living organisms their ability undergo evolution and replicate through some scientists argue that viruses neither nor reproduce viruses are evolved their host meaning that there was evolution viruses and host host cells did not viral evolution would this not true for viruses did not the direction evolution could however the ability evolve would not for the viruses totally rely machinery replicate the discovery viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong the tree life the presence these genes suggested that viruses could metabolize the was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have cellular most they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral organizational terminology biological classification taxonomic ranks all organisms are classified the science alpha taxonomy into either taxa clades taxa are ranked groups which run from the general domain the specific species broad scheme ranks hierarchical order domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species give homo sapiens the latin binomial equating modern all members the species sapiens are least genetically able several species may belong but the members different species within genus are usually unable interbreed produce fertile the red wolf canis lupus rufus however may result interbreeding between the grey wolf canis lupus and the coyote canis latrans homo only has one surviving species sapiens homo erectus homo neanderthalensis etc having become extinct thousands years some scientists argue for interbreeding between sapiens and neanderthalensis with fertile several genera belong the same family and the eventually the relevant kingdom animalia the case placed into one the three domains depending upon certain genetic and structural all living organisms known science are given classification this system such that the species within particular family are more closely related and genetically similar than the species within particular since viruses are not living their classification challenging viruses were classified according their plant animal bacteriophages later they were classified the disease that they for respiratory enterics now viruses are classified based the nucleic acid capsid symmetry and the presence absence the chemistry organisms are complex chemical organized ways that promote reproduction and some measure sustainability the same laws that govern living chemistry govern the chemical processes life generally the phenomena entire organisms that determine their fitness environment and therefore the survivability their dna based organisms clearly owe their metabolism and many other internal functions chemical especially the chemistry large organic organisms are complex systems chemical compounds that through interaction and play wide variety organisms are closed chemical although they are individual units life the definition they are not closed the environment around operate they constantly take and release autotrophs produce usable energy the form organic using light from the sun inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take organic compounds from the the primary chemical element these compounds carbon the chemical properties this element such its great affinity for bonding with other small including other carbon and its small size making capable forming multiple make ideal the basis organic able form small atom compounds such carbon dioxide well large chains many thousands atoms that can store data nucleic acids hold cells and transmit information macromolecules compounds that make organisms may divided into macromolecules and other smaller the four groups macromolecule are nucleic acids proteins carbohydrates and lipids nucleic acids specifically deoxyribonucleic store genetic data sequence nucleotides the particular sequence the four different types nucleotides adenine cytosine guanine and thymine dictate many characteristics that constitute the the sequence divided into codons each which particular sequence three nucleotides and corresponds particular amino acid thus sequence dna codes for particular protein due the chemical properties the amino acids made folds particular manner and performs particular these protein functions have been enzymes which catalyze all the reactions metabolism structural such tubulin collagen regulatory such transcription factors cyclins that regulate the cell cycle signaling molecules their receptors such some hormones and their receptors defensive which can include everything from antibodies the immune system toxins dendrotoxins proteins that include unusual amino acids like canavanine bilayer phospholipids makes the membrane cells that constitutes containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing and out the due the selective permeability the phospholipid membraine only specific compounds can pass through some multicellular organisms they serve storage energy and mediate communication between carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy compare lipids and carbohydrates are the number one source energy for all living structure all organisms consist monomeric units called cells some contain single cell and others contain many units multicellular organisms are able specialize cells perform specific group such cells tissue and animals these occur four basic namely epithelium nervous tissue muscle tissue and connective tissue several types tissue work together the form organ produce particular function such the pumping the blood the heart barrier the environment the skin this pattern continues higher level with several organs functioning organ system allow for reproduction digestion etc many multicellular organisms consist several organ which coordinate allow for cell the cell theory first developed schleiden and schwann states that all organisms are composed one more all cells come from preexisting all vital functions organism occur within and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information the next generation there are two types eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are usually while eukaryotic cells are usually found multicellular prokaryotic cells lack nuclear membrane dna unbound within the eukaryotic cells have nuclear all whether prokaryotic have membrane which envelops the separates its interior from its regulates what moves and and maintains the electric potential the cell inside the salty cytoplasm takes most the cell all cells possess the hereditary material genes and rna containing the information necessary build various proteins such enzymes the primary there are also other kinds biomolecules all cells share several similar characteristics reproduction cell division binary fission mitosis meiosis use enzymes and other proteins coded dna genes and made via messenger rna intermediates and ribosomes metabolism including taking raw building cell converting molecules and releasing products the functioning cell depends upon its ability extract and use chemical energy stored organic this energy derived from metabolic pathways response external and internal stimuli such changes nutrient cell contents are contained within cell surface membrane that contains proteins and lipid bilayer life span one the basic parameters organism its life span some organisms live short one while some plants and fungi can live thousands evolution common descent origin life last universal ancestor last universal ancestor the last universal ancestor the most recent organism from which all organisms now living earth descend thus the most recent common ancestor all current life the lua estimated have lived some billion years ago sometime the paleoarchean era the earliest evidences for life earth are graphite found biogenic billion old metasedimentary rocks discovered western greenland and microbial mat fossils found billion old sandstone discovered western australia information about the early development life includes input from many different including geology and planetary science these sciences provide information about the history the earth and the changes produced however great deal information about the early earth has been destroyed geological processes over the course all organisms earth are descended from common ancestor ancestral gene evidence for common descent may found traits shared between all living the evidence shared traits was based solely visible observation morphologic such the fact that all birds have even those that not today there strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have common for every living cell makes use nucleic acids its genetic and uses the same twenty amino acids the building blocks for proteins all organisms use the same genetic code with some extremely rare and minor translate nucleic acid sequences into the universality these traits strongly suggests common because the selection many these traits seems ford doolittle discussed variability the genetic code genetic code variation and suggested that horizontal gene transfer might make difficult study the last universal formal mathematical test calculated from the genetic record and particular the universal use the same genetic same and same amino that the factor favor common existence reproduction sexual reproduction sex widespread among current and evidence suggests that primordial and fundamental characteristic dacks and rogers proposed the basis phylogenetic that sex was present the common ancestor all the finding core set genes necessary for meiosis the descendants lineages that diverged early form the eukaryotic evolutionary tree also led ramesh and malik suggest that sex was present common ancestor all furthermore this view supported evidence that eukaryotes previously regarded ancient such were likely sexual the and that most present day asexual amoeboid lineages likely arose recently and natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer dna from one bacterium another and integration the donor dna into the recipient chromosome natural bacterial transformation considered primitive sexual process and occurs both bacteria and although has been studied mainly transformation clearly bacterial adaptation and not accidental because depends numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other enter state natural competence perform this complex transformation common mode dna and over prokaryotic species are known naturally competent for transformation prokaryotes has basic similarities sex and has been proposed that eukaryotic sex evolved from prokaryotic history life timeline evolution the chemical evolution from self catalytic chemical reactions life see origin life not part biological but unclear which point such increasingly complex sets reactions became what would today living precambrian stromatolites glacier national park nature cyanobacteria little known about the earliest developments however all existing organisms share certain including cellular structure and genetic code most scientists interpret this mean all existing organisms share common which had already developed the most fundamental cellular but there scientific consensus the relationship the three domains life bacteria eukaryota the origin attempts shed light the earliest history life generally focus the behavior macromolecules particularly and the behavior complex systems the emergence oxygenic photosynthesis around billion years and the subsequent emergence non reducing atmosphere can traced through the formation banded iron deposits and later red beds iron this was necessary prerequisite for the development aerobic cellular respiration believed have emerged around billion years the last billion simple multicellular plants and animals began appear the soon after the emergence the first the cambrian explosion period unrivaled and but organismal diversity documented the fossils found the burgess shale saw the creation all the major body phyla modern this event now believed have been triggered the development the hox genes about million years plants and fungi colonized the and were soon followed arthropods and other leading the development land ecosystems the evolutionary process may exceedingly fossil evidence indicates that the diversity and complexity modern life has developed over much the history the earth geological evidence indicates that the earth approximately billion years old studies guppies david reznick the university riverside however have shown that the rate evolution through natural selection can proceed thousand million times faster than what indicated the fossil such comparative studies however are invariably biased disparities the time scales over which evolutionary change measured the field and the fossil horizontal gene transfer horizontal gene transfer the ancestry living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from but increasingly supplemented with the reconstruction phylogenies the comparison genetic sequence sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries phylogenetic domains thus determining the phylogenetic history species can not done conclusively determining evolutionary trees for single biologist gogarten suggests the original metaphor tree longer fits the data from recent genome therefore biologists use the metaphor mosaic describe the different histories combined individual genomes and use metaphor net visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects hgt
