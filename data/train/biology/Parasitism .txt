parasitism parasite latest accepted revision accepted july navigation search parasite brood parasitism tetragnatha montana acrodactyla quadrisculpta lithognathus cymothoa exigua parasitism mutual symbiotic relationship between species where one the parasite benefits the expense the the host traditionally parasite referred primarily organisms visible the naked macroparasites typically protozoa and helminths parasite now includes microparasites which are typically such viruses and bacteria some examples parasites include the plants mistletoe and cuscuta and animals such hookworms unlike predators parasites not kill their are generally much smaller than their and will often live their host for extended both are special cases consumer resource interactions parasites show high degree specialization and reproduce faster rate than their classic examples parasitism include interactions between vertebrate hosts and tapeworms flukes the plasmodium species and fleas parasitism differs from the parasitoid relationship because parasitoids generally kill their parasites reduce host biological fitness general specialized pathology such parasitic castration and impairment secondary sex characteristics the modification host parasites increase their fitness exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their food water heat habitat and transmission although parasitism applies unambiguously many part continuum types interactions between species rather than exclusive many difficult demonstrate that the host there may apparent specialization the part the the interaction

diversity ecology adaptation transmission roles ecosystems value see also references further reading external links etymology first used english the word parasite comes from the medieval french parasite from the latin parasitus the latinisation the greek parasitos one who eats the table and that from para sitos wheat coined english the word parasitism comes from the greek para sitismos fattening types parasites are classified based their interactions with their hosts and their life cycles obligate parasite totally dependent the host complete its life while facultative parasite pediculus humanus capitis parasites that live the surface the host are called ectoparasites some mites those that live inside the host are called endoparasites including all parasitic worms endoparasites can exist one two intercellular parasites inhabiting spaces the intracellular parasites inhabiting cells the intracellular such protozoa bacteria viruses tend rely third which generally known the carrier the vector does the job transmitting them the example this interaction the transmission malaria caused protozoan the genus plasmodium humans the bite anopheline mosquito those parasites living intermediate being ectoparasites and are sometimes called mesoparasite schistosoma mansoni epiparasite one that feeds another this relationship also sometimes referred hyperparasitism exemplified protozoan the living the digestive tract flea living social parasites take advantage interactions between members social organisms such ants termites example phengaris arion butterfly whose larvae employ mimicry parasitize certain species kleptoparasitism parasites appropriate food gathered the example the brood parasitism practiced cuckoos and cowbirds which not build nests their own and leave their eggs nests other species the host behaves babysitter they raise the young their the host removes the some cuckoos will return and attack the nest compel host birds remain subject this intraspecific social parasitism may also one example this parasitic where some individuals take milk from unrelated wedge capped capuchins higher ranking females sometimes take milk from low ranking females without any the high ranking females benefit the expense the low ranking parasitism can take the form isolated cheating exploitation among more generalized mutualistic interactions for broad classes plants and fungi exchange carbon and nutrients common mutualistic mycorrhizal relationships however some plant species known myco heterotrophs cheat taking carbon from fungus rather than donating parasite parasite which the host species closely related the often being member the same family example this the citrus blackfly encarsia perplexa unmated females which may lay haploid eggs the fully developed larvae their own these result the production male the marine worm bonellia viridis has similar reproductive although the larvae are autoinfection the infection primary host with particularly helminth such way that the complete life cycle the parasite happens single without the involvement another therefore the primary host the same time the secondary host the some the organisms where autoinfection occurs are strongyloides stercoralis enterobius vermicularis taenia solium and hymenolepis nana strongyloidiasis for example involves premature transformation noninfective larvae infective which can then penetrate the intestinal mucosa internal the skin the perineal area external infection can maintained repeated migratory cycles for the remainder the host defenses animal defenses skin the first line defense against invading parasite the skin skin made layers dead cells and acts physical barrier invading these dead cells contain the protein keratin which makes skin tough and most microorganism needs moist environment keeping the skin prevents invading organisms from furthermore our skin also secretes sebum which toxic most mouth the mouth contains which prevents foreign organism from getting into the body furthermore the mouth also contains lysozyme enzyme found tears and the this enzyme breaks down cell walls invading stomach should the organism pass the the stomach the next line the stomach contains hydrochloric acid and gastric which makes its level around this the acidity the stomach helps kill most microorganisms that try invade the body through the gastric intestinal eyes parasites can also invade the body through the eyes the lashes the eyelid prevents invading microorganisms from entering the eye the first even the microorganism get into the tears contain the enzyme which will kill most invading immune system should the parasite enter the the immune system major defense against parasitic the immune system made different families these include serum proteins and pattern recognition receptors prrs are intracellular and cellular receptors that activate dendritic which turn activate the adaptive immune lymphocytes lymphocytes such the cells and antibody producing cells with variable receptors that recognize plant defenses response parasitic plants undergo series metabolic and biochemical reaction pathways that will enact defensive for parasitic invasion causes increase the jasmonic insensitivel and nahg pathway these pathways produces chemicals that will induce defensive such the production chemicals defensive molecules fight off the different biochemical pathways are activated different there are two types responses that can activated the plants can either initiate specific specific specific responses involve gene recognition the plant and this can mediated the ability the cell receptors recognizing and binding molecules that are located the cell surface once the receptors recognizes the the plant localizes the defensive compounds that area creating hypersensitive this form defense mechanism localizes the area attack and keeps the parasite from furthermore specific response against parasitic attack prevents the plants from wasting its energy increasing defenses where not however specific defensive responses only target specific the plant lacks the ability recognize specific defense responses nonspecific defensive responses work against all these responses are active over time and are meaning that the responses are not confined area the but rather spread throughout the entirety the however nonspecific responses are energy since the plant has ensure that the genes producing the nonspecific responses are always evolutionary aspects parasitism has arisen independently many depending the definition many half all animals have least one parasitic phase their life and frequent plants and fungi almost all living animals are host one more parasitic taxa tyrannosaurus trichomonas parasites evolve response their defences sometimes manner specific particular host taxon and specializing the point where they infect only single such narrow host specificity can costly over evolutionary however the host species becomes extinct therefore many parasites can infect variety more less closely related host with different success citation needed host defenses coevolve response attacks theoretically parasites may have advantage this evolutionary arms race because their generation time commonly hosts reproduce less quickly than and therefore have fewer chances adapt than their parasites over given span long term coevolution sometimes leads relatively stable relationship tending commensalism mutualism all else being the evolutionary interest the parasite that its host parasite may evolve become less harmful for its host host may evolve cope with the unavoidable presence the point that the absence causes the host for although animals infected with parasitic worms are often clearly and therefore such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects autoimmune disorders animal including competition between parasites tends favor faster reproducing and therefore more virulent parasites citation needed parasites whose life cycle involves the death the exit the present host and sometimes enter the evolve more virulent even alter the behavior other properties the host make more vulnerable parasites that reproduce largely the offspring the previous host tend become less virulent mutualist that its hosts reproduce more the presumption shared evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can sometimes elucidate how host taxa are for there has been dispute about whether flamingos are more closely related the storks and their ducks geese and their the fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese evidence these groups may more closely related each other than either parasitism part one explanation for the evolution secondary sex characteristics seen breeding males throughout the animal world such the plumage male peacocks and manes male lions according this female hosts select males for breeding based such characteristics because they indicate resistance parasites and other disease speciation rare parasite may even undergo speciation with its one particularly remarkable example speciation exists between the simian foamy virus and its primate one the phylogenies sfv polymerase and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit from african and asian primates were surprisingly the phylogenetic trees were very congruent branching order and divergence thus the simian foamy viruses may have speciated with old world primates for least million ecology quantitative ecology single parasite species usually has aggregated distribution across host which means that most hosts harbor few while few hosts carry the vast majority parasite this poses considerable problems for students parasite the use parametric statistics should citation needed transformation data before the application parametric the use non parametric statistics recommended several however this can give rise further therefore modern day quantitative parasitology based more advanced biostatistical diversity ecology hosts represent discrete habitat patches that can occupied hierarchical set terminology has come into use describe parasite assemblages different host metapopulation the diversity ecology parasites differs markedly from that living for living diversity ecology features many strong conceptual frameworks including robert macarthur and wilson theory island biogeography jared diamond assembly rules and more null models such stephen hubbell unified neutral theory biodiversity and biogeography frameworks are not developed for parasites and many ways they not fit the living for island biogeography predicated fixed spatial relationships between habitat patches sinks usually with reference mainland source parasites inhabit which represent mobile habitat patches with dynamic spatial there true mainland other than the sum hosts host parasite component communities host populations are nonetheless different types parasite assemblages have been recognized host individuals and and many the patterns observed for living organisms are also pervasive among parasite the most prominent these the isolationist this proposes that parasite assemblages occur along cline from interactive where niches are saturated and interspecific competition isolationist where there are many vacant niches and interspecific interaction not important stochastic factors providing structure the whether this whether community patterns simply reflect the sum underlying species distributions real structure the has not yet been adaptation parasites infect hosts that exist within their same geographical area sympatric more this phenomenon supports the red queen hypothesis which states that interactions between species such host and lead constant natural selection for adaptation and counter the parasites track the locally common host therefore the parasites are less infective allopatric from different geographical hosts citation needed experiments published discuss the analysis two different snail populations from two different lake ianthe and lake poerua new zealand the populations were exposed two pure parasites digenetic trematode taken from the same the the snails were infected their sympatric allopatric parasites and mixed sources the results suggest that the parasites were more highly effective infecting their sympatric snails than their allopatric though the allopatric snails were still infected the the infectivity was much less when compared the sympatric hence the parasites were found have adapted infecting local populations transmission parasites have many ways get into their for the acanthamoeba enters the body when the environment not the strongyloides stercoralis enters the body when host steps infected ground with bare many parasites use the food ate and waiting plasmodium malariae uses mosquito host transmit malaria loa loa parasite also uses deer fly transmitten into host and infects its entamoeba histolytica parasites inhabit living organisms and therefore face problems that living organisms hosts the only habitats which parasites can actively try repel and destroy parasites employ numerous strategies for getting from one host process sometimes referred parasite transmission colonization some endoparasites infect their host penetrating its external while others must once inside the adult endoparasites need shed offspring into the external environment infect other many adult endoparasites reside the gastrointestinal tract where offspring can shed along with host excreta adult stages tapeworms thorny headed worms and most flukes use this among protozoan endoparasites such the malarial parasites and trypanosomes infective stages the blood are transported new hosts insects vectors larval stages endoparasites often infect sites the host other than the blood gastrointestinal tract many such larval endoparasites require their host consumed the next host the parasite life cycle order survive and alternatively larval endoparasites may shed living transmission stages that migrate through the tissue into the external where they actively search for await ingestion other the foregoing strategies are variously larval stages tapeworms thorny headed worms flukes and parasitic roundworms some such monogenean worms rely direct contact between ectoparasitic arthropods may rely host contact many lice shed eggs that survive off the host fleas wait the external environment for encounter with host ticks some aquatic leeches locate hosts sensing movement and only attach when certain temperature and chemical cues are some parasites modify host behavior make transmission other hosts more for california salt the fluke euhaplorchis californiensis reduces the ability its killifish host avoid this parasite matures egrets which are more likely feed infected killifish than uninfected another example the protozoan toxoplasma gondii parasite that matures cats but can carried many other mammals uninfected rats avoid cat but rats infected with gondii are drawn this which may increase transmission feline roles ecosystems modifying the behavior infected make transmission other hosts more likely one way parasites can affect the structure ecosystems for the case euhaplorchis californiensis discussed plausible that the local predator and prey species might different this parasite were absent from the although parasites are often omitted depictions food webs they usually occupy the top parasites can function like keystone species reducing the dominance superior competitors and allowing competing species many parasites require multiple hosts the different species complete their life cycles and rely prey other stable ecological interactions get from one host this the parasites ecosystem reflect the health that value although parasites are generally considered the eradication all parasites would not necessarily parasites account for much more than half they perform important ecological role weakening that ecosystems would take some time adapt and without parasites organisms may eventually tend asexual diminishing the diversity sexually dimorphic parasites provide opportunity for the transfer genetic material between but occasions this may facilitate evolutionary changes that would not otherwise that would otherwise take even see also coinfection resource systems endosymbiotic theory human parasites hyperparasite infection intestinal parasite list human parasitic diseases
