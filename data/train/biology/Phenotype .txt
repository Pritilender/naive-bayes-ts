biology	phenotype navigation search introduction genetics shells bivalve mollusk donax variabilis punnett square phenotype from greek phainein meaning and typos meaning type the composite organism observable characteristics traits such its morphology development biochemical physiological phenology behavior and products behavior such phenotype results from the expression genes well the influence environmental factors and the interactions between the when two more clearly different phenotypes exist the same population the species called polymorph the genotype organism the inherited instructions carries within its genetic not all organisms with the same genotype look act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified environmental and developmental likewise not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same this genotype phenotype distinction was proposed wilhelm johannsen make clear the difference between heredity and what that heredity the distinction similar that proposed august weismann who distinguished between germ plasm and somatic cells the the phenotype distinction should not confused with francis crick central dogma molecular biology which statement about the directionality molecular sequential information flowing from dna and not the contents difficulties definition phenotypic variation the extended phenotype phenome and phenomics see also references external links difficulties definition despite its seemingly straightforward the concept the phenotype has hidden may seem that anything dependent the genotype including molecules such rna and most molecules and structures coded the genetic material are not visible the appearance yet they are observable for example western blotting and are thus part the human blood groups are may also seem that this goes beyond the original intentions the concept with its focus the organism meaning that the lowest level biological organization compatible with the phenotype concept the cellular either the term phenotype includes traits characteristics that can made visible some technical notable extension this idea the presence organic metabolites that are generated organisms from chemical reactions vitamins that can scored another extension adds behavior the since behaviors are also observable indeed there research into the clinical relevance behavioral phenotypes they pertain range often the term phenotype incorrectly used shorthand indicate phenotypical changes observed mutated organisms most often connection with knockout mice biston betularia typica biston betularia carbonaria phenotypic variation phenotypic variation due underlying heritable genetic variation fundamental prerequisite for evolution natural selection the living organism whole that contributes the next natural selection affects the genetic structure population indirectly via the contribution without phenotypic there would evolution natural citation needed the interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized the following genotype environment phenotype more nuanced version the relationship genotype environment genotype environment interactions phenotype genotypes often have much flexibility the modification and expression many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions see ecophenotypic variation the plant hieracium umbellatum found growing two different habitats sweden one habitat sea side cliffs where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded inflorescences the other among sand dunes where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact these habitats alternate along the coast sweden and the habitat that the seeds hieracium umbellatum land determine the phenotype that example random variation drosophila flies the number ommatidia which may vary between left and right eyes single individual much they between different genotypes between clones raised different the concept phenotype can extended variations below the level the gene that affect for silent mutations that not change the corresponding amino acid sequence gene may change the frequency guanine cytosine base pairs content these base pairs have higher thermal stability melting point see also dna dna hybridization than adenine thymine property that might among organisms living temperature selective advantage variants enriched the extended phenotype the extended phenotype the idea the phenotype has been generalized richard dawkins the extended phenotype mean all the effects gene has the outside world that may influence its chances being these can effects the organism which the gene the other for beaver dam might considered phenotype beaver genes the same way powerful incisor teeth are phenotype expressions their dawkins also cites the effect organism the behaviour another organism such the devoted nurturing cuckoo parent different example the extended the smallest unit replicators the replicators cannot directly selected but they are selected their phenotypic these effects are packaged together should think the replicator having extended phenotypic these are all the ways affects the not just the effects the replicators have the body which they phenome and phenomics although phenotype the ensemble observable characteristics displayed the word phenome sometimes used refer collection while the simultaneous study such collection referred phenomics see also ecotype endophenotype the extended phenotype potentiality and actuality
