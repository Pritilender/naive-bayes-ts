biology	phototroph navigation search tropism phototropism phototrophs light nourishment are the organisms that carry out photon capture acquire they use the energy from light carry out various cellular metabolic common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic many but not phototrophs often they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material utilized functionally source for later catabolic processes the form sugars and all phototrophs either use electron transport chains direct proton pumping establish chemical gradient which utilized atp synthase provide the molecular energy currency for the phototrophs can either autotrophs heterotrophs contents photoautotroph ecology photoheterotroph flowchart see also references photoautotroph most the recognized phototrophs are also known photoautotrophs and can fix carbon they can contrasted with chemotrophs that obtain their energy the oxidation electron donors their photoautotrophs are capable synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances using light energy green plants and photosynthetic bacteria are photoautotrophic organisms are sometimes referred holophytic such organisms derives their energy for food synthesis from light and are capable using carbon dioxide their principal source oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll for energy capture and oxidize splitting into molecular anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria have substance called bacteriochlorophyll which absorbs predominantly optical wavelengths for energy live aquatic and using oxidize chemical substances such hydrogen sulfide rather than ecology ecological context phototrophs are often the food source for neighboring heterotrophic terrestrial plants are the predominant while aquatic environments include range phototrophic organisms such algae kelp other protists such euglena phytoplankton and bacteria such cyanobacteria the depth which sunlight artificial light can penetrate into that photosynthesis may known the photic zone cyanobacteria which are prokaryotic organisms which carry out oxygenic occupy many environmental including fresh seas soil and lichen cyanobacteria carry out like photosynthesis because the organelle plants that carries out photosynthesis actually derived from endosymbiosis cyanobacteria photolithoautotroph autotrophic organism that uses light and inorganic electron donor and its carbon source examples include photoheterotroph photoheterotroph contrast photoheterotrophs are organisms that depend solely light for their energy and principally organic compounds carbon dioxide for their photoheterotrophs produce atp through photophosphorylation but use environmentally obtained organic compounds build structures and other flowchart heterotroph autotroph chemoautotroph photoautotroph heterotroph chemoheterotroph photoheterotroph see also primary nutritional groups prototroph
