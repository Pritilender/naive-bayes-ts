includes the study all the internal activities those chemical and physical processes associated with life they occur this includes study many levels scale size and the smallest scale are molecular interactions photosynthesis and internal diffusion minerals and the largest scale are the processes plant development seasonality dormancy and reproductive control major subdisciplines plant physiology include phytochemistry the study the biochemistry and phytopathology the study disease the scope plant physiology discipline may divided into several major areas first the study phytochemistry plant included within the domain plant function and plants produce wide array chemical compounds not found other photosynthesis requires large array pigments enzymes and other compounds because they cannot plants must also defend themselves chemically from herbivores pathogens and competition from other they this producing toxins and tasting smelling other compounds defend plants against permit survival during and prepare plants for while other compounds are used attract pollinators herbivores spread ripe secondly plant physiology includes the study biological and chemical processes individual plant cells plant cells have number features that distinguish them from cells animals and which lead major differences the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal for plant cells have cell wall which restricts the shape plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility plant cells also contain chlorophyll chemical compound that interacts with light way that enables plants manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things animals thirdly plant physiology deals with interactions between tissues and organs within different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized perform different roots and rhizoids function anchor the plant and acquire minerals the leaves catch light order manufacture for both these organs remain minerals that the roots acquire must transported the and the nutrients manufactured the leaves must transported the plants have developed number ways achieve this such vascular tissue and the functioning the various modes transport studied plant fourthly plant physiologists study the ways that plants control regulate internal like plants produce chemicals called hormones which are produced one part the plant signal cells another part the plant many flowering plants bloom the appropriate time because sensitive compounds that respond the length the phenomenon known photoperiodism the ripening fruit and loss leaves the winter are controlled part the production the gas ethylene the finally plant physiology includes the study plant response environmental conditions and their field known environmental physiology stress from water changes air crowding other plants can lead changes the way plant these changes may affected chemical and physical biochemistry plants latex tapped rubber tree phytochemistry the chemical elements which plants are principally carbon oxygen hydrogen nitrogen phosphorus sulfur etc are the same for all other life forms fungi bacteria and even viruses only the details the molecules into which they are assembled despite this underlying plants produce vast array chemical compounds with unique properties which they use cope with their pigments are used plants absorb detect and are extracted humans for use dyes other plant products may used for the manufacture commercially important rubber biofuel perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with pharmacological activity such salicylic acid from which aspirin morphine and digoxin drug companies spend billions dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal constituent elements plant nutrition plants require some nutrients such carbon and nitrogen large quantities such nutrients are termed macronutrients where the prefix macro refers the quantity not the size the nutrient particles other called micronutrients are required only trace amounts for plants remain such micronutrients are usually absorbed ions dissolved water taken from the though carnivorous plants acquire some their micronutrients from captured the following tables list element nutrients essential uses within plants are macronutrients necessary large quantities nitrogen oxygen cellulose starch carbon hydrogen potassium calcium magnesium phosphorus sulfur micronutrients chlorine iron boron manganese zinc copper molybdenum nickel pigments chlorophyll anthocyanin pansies biological pigment among the most important molecules for plant function are the pigments plant pigments include variety different kinds including porphyrins carotenoids and anthocyanins all biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths light while reflecting others the light that absorbed may used the plant power chemical reactions while the reflected wavelengths light determine the color the pigment appears the chlorophyll the primary pigment porphyrin that absorbs red and blue wavelengths light while reflecting green the presence and relative abundance chlorophyll that gives plants their green all land plants and green algae possess two forms this chlorophyll and chlorophyll kelps diatoms and other photosynthetic heterokonts contain chlorophyll instead red algae possess chlorophyll and all chlorophylls serve the primary means plants use intercept light fuel photosynthesis carotenoids are orange yellow tetraterpenoids they function accessory pigments helping fuel photosynthesis gathering wavelengths light not readily absorbed the most familiar carotenoids are carotene orange pigment found carrots lutein yellow pigment found fruits and and lycopene the red pigment responsible for the color tomatoes carotenoids have been shown act antioxidants and promote healthy eyesight anthocyanins literally flower are water soluble flavonoid pigments that appear red according they occur all tissues higher providing color leaves stems roots flowers and fruits though not always sufficient quantities anthocyanins are most visible the petals where they may make much the dry weight the they are also responsible for the purple color seen the underside tropical shade plants such tradescantia zebrina these the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects back towards regions bearing order maximize the use available light betalains are red yellow like anthocyanins they are but unlike anthocyanins they are indole derived compounds synthesized from tyrosine this class pigments found only the caryophyllales including cactus and amaranth and never occur plants with betalains are responsible for the deep red color beets and are used commercially coloring plant physiologists are uncertain the function that betalains have plants which possess but there some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal signals and regulators mutation arabidopsis thaliana auxin plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act signal physiological response their they also produce compounds such phytochrome that are sensitive light and which serve trigger growth development response environmental plant hormones plant hormone plant hormones known plant growth regulators are chemicals that regulate according standard animal hormones are signal molecules produced specific that occur very low and cause altered processes target cells other unlike plants lack specific producing tissues plant hormones are often not transported other parts the plant and production not limited specific plant hormones are chemicals that small amounts promote and influence the growth development and differentiation cells and hormones are vital plant affecting processes plants from flowering seed development dormancy and germination they regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow leaf formation and stem fruit development and well leaf abscission and even plant the most important plant hormones are abscissic acid auxins ethylene gibberellins and cytokinins though there are many other substances that serve regulate plant photomorphogenesis photomorphogenesis while most people know that light important for photosynthesis few realize that plant sensitivity light plays role the control plant structural development morphogenesis the use light control structural development called photomorphogenesis and dependent upon the presence specialized photoreceptors which are chemical pigments capable absorbing specific wavelengths plants use four kinds phytochrome cryptochrome photoreceptor and protochlorophyllide the first two phytochrome and are photoreceptor proteins complex molecular structures formed joining protein with sensitive cryptochrome also known the because absorbs ultraviolet light the long wave region the receptor one more compounds not yet identified with though some evidence suggests carotene riboflavin protochlorophyllide its name chemical precursor chlorophyll the most studied the photoreceptors plants phytochrome sensitive light the red and far red region the visible spectrum many flowering plants use regulate the time flowering based the length day and night photoperiodism and set circadian also regulates other responses including the germination elongation the shape and number the synthesis and the straightening the epicotyl hypocotyl hook dicot seedlings photoperiodism poinsettia photoperiodism many flowering plants use the pigment phytochrome sense seasonal changes day length which they take signals this sensitivity day length termed photoperiodism broadly flowering plants can classified long day short day day neutral depending their particular response changes day long day plants require certain minimum length daylight starts these plants flower the spring conversely short day plants flower when the length daylight falls below certain critical day neutral plants not initiate flowering based though some may use temperature sensitivity vernalization instead although short day plant cannot flower during the long days not actually the period light exposure that limits rather short day plant requires minimal length uninterrupted darkness each hour period short before floral development can has been determined experimentally that short day plant long does not flower flash phytochrome activating light used the plant during the plants make use the phytochrome system sense day length this fact utilized florists and greenhouse gardeners control and even induce flowering out such the poinsettia environmental physiology phototropism arabidopsis thaliana ecophysiology the subdiscipline environmental physiology the one hand recent field study plant ecology and the other hand one the environmental physiology the preferred name the subdiscipline among plant but goes number other names the applied roughly synonymous with ecophysiology crop horticulture and agronomy the particular name applied the subdiscipline specific the viewpoint and goals whatever name deals with the ways which plants respond their environment and overlaps with the field ecology environmental physiologists examine plant response physical factors such radiation including light and ultraviolet radiation temperature fire and wind particular importance are water relations which can measured with the pressure bomb and the stress drought inundation exchange gases with the atmosphere well the cycling nutrients such nitrogen and carbon environmental physiologists also examine plant response biological this includes not only negative such competition herbivory disease and parasitism but also positive such mutualism and pollination tropisms and nastic movements tropism nastic movement plants may respond both directional and directional stimuli response directional such gravity sun light called response nondirectional such temperature humidity nastic tropisms plants are the result differential cell growth which the cells one side the plant elongates more than those the other causing the part bend toward the side with less among the common tropisms seen plants phototropism the bending the plant toward source phototropism allows the plant maximize light exposure plants which require additional light for minimize plants subjected intense light and geotropism allows the roots plant determine the direction gravity and grow tropisms generally result from interaction between the environment and production one more plant nastic movements results from differential cell growth epinasty and from changes turgor pressure within plant tissues nyctinasty which may occur familiar example thigmonasty response the venus fly trap carnivorous plant the traps consist modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger when the hairs are touched insect other the leaf folds this mechanism allows the plant trap and digest small insects for additional although the trap rapidly shut changes internal cell the leaf must grow slowly reset for second opportunity trap plant disease powdery mildew phytopathology one the most important areas research environmental physiology that phytopathology the study diseases plants and the manner which plants resist cope with plant are susceptible the same kinds disease organisms including viruses bacteria and fungi well physical invasion insects and roundworms because the biology plants differs with their symptoms and responses are quite some plant can simply shed infected leaves flowers prevent the spread process called most animals not have this option means controlling plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical plant pathogens tend spread via spores are carried animal vectors one the most important advances the control plant disease was the discovery bordeaux mixture the nineteenth the mixture the first known fungicide and combination copper sulfate and lime application the mixture served inhibit the growth downy mildew that threatened seriously damage the french wine industry history history botany early history jan baptist van helmont sir francis bacon published one the first plant physiology experiments the sylva bacon grew several terrestrial including water and ended that soil was only needed keep the plant jan baptist van helmont published what considered the first quantitative experiment plant physiology grew willow tree for five years pot containing pounds dry the soil lost just two ounces dry weight and van helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from not john woodward published experiments growth spearmint different sources found that plants grew much better water with soil added than distilled stephen hales considered the father plant physiology for the many experiments the book though julius von sachs unified the pieces plant physiology and put them together his lehrbuch der botanik was the plant physiology bible its researchers discovered the that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients inorganic ions natural soil acts mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself not essential plant when the mineral nutrients the soil are dissolved plant roots absorb nutrients soil longer required for the plant this observation the basis for hydroponics the growing plants water solution rather than which has become standard technique biological teaching lab crop production and current research one the leading journals the field plant physiology started all its back issues are available online for many other journals often carry plant
