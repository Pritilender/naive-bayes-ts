links historical and modern terminology the relationships among the different groups primates were not clearly understood until relatively the commonly used terms are somewhat for ape has been used either alternative for monkey for any relatively humanlike sir wilfrid gros clark was one the primatologists who developed the idea trends primate and that the living members the order could arranged ascending series leading commonly used names for groups for example prosimians monkeys lesser apes and great apes reflect this according our current understanding the evolutionary history the several these groups are paraphyletic meaning that although all the species the group descend from common the group does not include all the descendants that contrast with approaches such those gros modern classifications typically use groups that are monophyletic since they include all the descendants common the diagram below shows one possible classification the living with groups with commonly used names shown the haplorhini simiiformes catarrhini hominoidea hominidae homininae humans homo chimpanzees and bonobos pan gorillas subfamily orangutans subfamily gibbons old world monkeys superfamily new world monkeys parvorder tarsiiformes tarsiers superfamily strepsirrhini lemuriformes lemurs superfamily lorises and allies superfamily all the groups that have scientific names are monophyletic they are clades the scientific classification reflects evolutionary some the traditional groups shown the which form ascending are prosimians contain two monophyletic the suborder strepsirrhini lorises and well the which are sister group the infraorder anthropoidea also called monkeys consist two monophyletic new world monkeys and old world but exclude hominoids superfamily apes and the great are not monophyletic because they exclude thus the two sets and hence not which causes problems relating scientific names common consider the superfamily terms the common names the this group consists apes and and there single common name for all the members the one possibility create new common this case hominoids another possibility expand the use one the traditional for book the vertebrate palaeontologist benton the hominoidea today include the gibbons and utan the gorilla and chimpanzee and thereby using apes mean hominoids the group traditionally called apes must then called the human july there consensus which approach whether accept traditional paraphyletic common names whether use monophyletic either new ones adaptations old both approaches will found biological

great including humans seven philippine tarsier prosimian haplorhine order primates was established carl linnaeus the tenth edition his book systema naturae for the genera homo simia other apes and lemur and vespertilio the first edition the same book had used the name anthropomorpha for homo simia and bradypus henri marie ducrotay blainville following linnaeus and imitating his established the orders secundates including the suborders chiroptera insectivora and carnivora tertiates glires and quaternates including gravigrada pachydermata and ruminantia but these new taxa were not before anderson and jones introduced the classification strepsirrhini and haplorhini followed mckenna and work classification above the species level the primates were divided into two prosimii and anthropoidea prosimii included all the prosimians strepsirrhini plus the tarsiers anthropoidea contained all the simians evolutionary history euarchontoglires glires rodentia lagomorpha hares pikas

research colugos and treeshrews has shown the two species colugos are more closely related primates than even though treeshrews were one time considered these three orders make the clade euarchonta the combination this clade with the clade glires composed rodentia and lagomorpha forms the clade variously both euarchonta and euarchontoglires are ranked some scientists consider dermoptera suborder primates and call the true primates the suborder evolution list fossil primates lemur evolutionary history the primate lineage thought back least million years ago mya even though the oldest known primates from the fossil record date the late paleocene africa altiatlasius the eocene transition the northern circa mya cantius donrussellia altanius and teilhardina other including molecular clock have estimated the origin the primate branch have been the cretaceous around mya modern cladistic reckoning the order primates monophyletic the suborder strepsirrhini the wet nosed primates generally thought have split off from the primitive primate line about although earlier dates are also the seven strepsirrhine families are the five related lemur families and the two remaining families that include the lorisids and the galagos older classification schemes wrap lepilemuridae into lemuridae and galagidae into lorisidae yielding one family distribution instead two presented during the eocene most the northern continents were dominated two the adapiforms and the omomyids the former are considered members but did not have toothcomb like modern recent analysis has demonstrated that darwinius masillae fits into this the latter was closely related monkeys and how these two groups relate extant primates omomyids perished about while adapiforms survived until about common brown lemur strepsirrhine according genetic the lemurs madagascar diverged from the lorisoids approximately mya these well chromosomal and molecular also show that lemurs are more closely related each other than other strepsirrhine however madagascar split from africa mya and from india mya account for these founding lemur population few individuals thought have reached madagascar from africa via single rafting event between and mya other colonization options have been such multiple colonizations from africa and but none are supported the genetic and molecular until the aye aye has been difficult place within theories had been proposed that its daubentoniidae was either lemuriform primate meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises sister group all the

soon there are two simian both parvorders catarrhini which developed consisting old world monkeys humans and the other apes and which developed south consisting new world monkeys third which included the eosimiids developed but went extinct millions years the case the origin new world monkeys molecular studies concatenated nuclear sequences have yielded widely varying estimated date divergence between platyrrhines and ranging from mya while studies based mitochondrial sequences produce narrower range mya the anthropoid primates possibly traversed the atlantic ocean from africa south america during the eocene island hopping facilitated atlantic ocean ridges and lowered sea alternatively single rafting event may explain this transoceanic due continental drift the atlantic ocean was not nearly wide the time research suggests that small primate could have survived days raft given estimated current and wind this would have provided enough time make the voyage between the emperor

africa and date back mya old world monkeys disappeared from europe about mya molecular and fossil studies generally show that modern humans originated africa years although primates are well studied comparison other animal several new species have been discovered recently and genetic tests have revealed previously unrecognised species known primate taxonomy listed about species primates the colin groves increased that number for his contribution the third edition mammal species the world however publications since the taxonomy was compiled have pushed the number species including hybrids primate hybrids usually arise but there have also been examples the hybridization occurs where two range overlap form hybrid zones hybrids may created humans when animals are placed zoos due environmental pressures such intergeneric hybrids different have also been found the although they belong genera that have been distinct for several million interbreeding still occurs between the gelada and the hamadryas baboon anatomy physiology and morphology primates have facing eyes the front the binocular vision allows accurate distance useful for the brachiating ancestors all great bony ridge above the eye sockets reinforces weaker bones the face which are put under strain during strepsirrhines have postorbital bar bone around the eye protect their the higher haplorhines have evolved fully enclosed the primate skull has domed cranium which particularly prominent anthropoids the cranium protects the large distinguishing characteristic this the endocranial volume the volume within the three times greater humans than the greatest nonhuman reflecting larger brain the mean endocranial volume cubic centimeters chimpanzees and the primary evolutionary trend primates has been the elaboration the particular the neocortex part the cerebral cortex which involved with sensory perception generation motor commands spatial conscious thought and language while other mammals rely heavily their sense smell the arboreal life primates has led tactile visually dominant sensory reduction the olfactory region the brain and increasingly complex social primates generally have five digits each limb pentadactyly with keratin nails the end each finger and the bottom sides the hands and feet have sensitive pads the fingertips most have opposable thumbs characteristic primate though not limited this opossums for also have thumbs allow some species use tools the combination opposing short fingernails rather than and inward closing fingers relict the ancestral practice gripping and allowed some species develop brachiation swinging the arms from tree limb tree significant means prosimians have clawlike nails the second toe each called toilet claws which they use for the primate collar bone retained prominent element the pectoral girdle this allows the shoulder joint broad apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due the dorsal position the scapula broad ribcages that are flatter and less mobile spine compared old world monkeys with lower vertebrae greatly resulting tail loss some old world monkeys are unlike apes that most have new world atelids including the howler spider woolly spider and woolly monkeys and new world capuchins have prehensile tails male primates typically have pendulous penis and scrotal primates show evolutionary trend towards reduced snout technically old world monkeys are distinguished from new world monkeys the structure the and from apes the arrangement their teeth new world the nostrils face old world they face dental pattern primates vary although some have lost most their incisors all retain least one lower most the lower incisors and canines form toothcomb which used grooming and sometimes and the first lower premolar shaped like old world monkeys have eight premolars compared with new world the old world species are divided into apes and monkeys depending the number cusps their molars apes have old world monkeys have although humans may have four the main hominid molar cusp hypocone evolved early primate while the cusp the corresponding primitive lower molar paraconid was prosimians are distinguished their immobilized upper the moist tip their noses and facing lower front tapetum lucidum northern greater galago the evolution color vision primates unique among most eutherian mammals while the remote vertebrate ancestors the primates possessed three color vision the nocturnal warm blooded mammalian ancestors lost one three cones the retina during the mesozoic era fish reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic tetrachromatic while all with the exception some primates and marsupials are dichromats monochromats totally color nocturnal such the night monkeys and bush babies are often catarrhines are routinely trichromatic due gene duplication the green opsin gene the base their million years platyrrhines the other are trichromatic few cases specifically individual females must heterozygous for two alleles the opsin gene red and located the same locus the chromosome males therefore can only while females can either dichromatic color vision strepsirrhines not well however research indicates range color vision similar that found like howler monkeys family show routine trichromatism that has been traced evolutionarily recent gene duplication howler monkeys are one the most specialized eaters the new world fruits are not major part their and the type leaves they prefer consume nutritive and are detectable only green field work exploring the dietary preferences howler monkeys suggests that routine trichromaticism was selected sexual dimorphism sexual dimorphism human primates hamadryas baboons sexual dimorphism often exhibited simians though greater degree old world species apes and some than new world recent studies involve comparing dna examine both the variation the expression the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes sexual primates usually have dimorphism body mass and canine tooth size along with pelage and skin the dimorphism can attributed and affected different including mating system size habitat and comparative analyses have generated more complete understanding the relationship between sexual selection natural selection and mating systems studies have shown that dimorphism the product changes both male and female ontogenetic scaling where relative extension common growth trajectory may give some insight into the relationship between sexual dimorphism and growth some evidence from the fossil record suggests that there was convergent evolution and some extinct hominids probably had greater dimorphism than any living locomotion diademed sifaka primate species move brachiation bipedalism leaping arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism climbing knuckle walking combination these several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers and these include many bushbabies all indriids sifakas avahis and indris sportive lemurs and all tarsiers other prosimians are arboreal quadrupeds and some are also terrestrial while some are most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and gibbons muriquis and spider monkeys all brachiate with gibbons sometimes doing remarkably acrobatic woolly monkeys also brachiate orangutans use similar form locomotion called quadramanous which they use their arms and legs carry their heavy bodies through the chimpanzees and gorillas knuckle and can move bipedally for short although numerous such australopithecines and early hominids have exhibited fully bipedal humans are the only extant species with this behavior social systems primates are among the most social forming pairs family uni male and female richard wrangham stated that social systems human primates are best classified the amount movement females occurring between proposed four female transfer females move away from the group which they were females group will not closely related whereas males will have remained with their natal and this close association may influential social the groups formed are generally quite this organization can seen where the who are typically will cooperate defense the among new world spider monkeys and muriquis use this male transfer while the females remain their natal the males will emigrate polygynous and male societies are classed this group sizes are usually this system common among the ring tailed lemur capuchin monkeys and cercopithecine monkeys monogamous female sometimes accompanied juvenile there shared responsibility parental care and territorial the offspring leaves the territory during gibbons essentially use this although monogamy this context does not necessarily mean absolute sexual solitary often males who defend territories that include the home ranges several this type organization found the prosimians such the slow loris orangutans not defend their territory but effectively have this other systems are known occur for with howler monkeys both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group reaching sexual resulting groups which neither the males nor females are typically some colobine monkeys and callitrichid monkeys use this chimpanzees primatologist jane goodall who studied the gombe stream national park noted fission fusion societies there fission where the main group splits forage during the then fusion when the group returns night sleep this social structure can also observed the hamadryas baboon spider monkeys and the bonobo the gelada has similar social structure which many smaller groups come together form temporary herds monkeys these social systems are affected three main ecological distribution group size and predation within social group there balance between cooperation and cooperative behaviors include social grooming removing skin parasites and cleaning food and collective defense against predators aggressive behaviors often signal competition for sleeping sites aggression also used establishing dominance hierarchies interspecific associations several species primates are known associate the some these associations have been extensively the tai forest africa several species coordinate predator these include the diana monkey campbell mona monkey lesser nosed monkey western red colobus king colobus and sooty mangabey which coordinate predator alarm among the predators these monkeys the common chimpanzee the red tailed monkey associates with several including the western red blue monkey wolf mona monkey mantled guereza black crested mangabey and allen swamp monkey several these species are preyed upon the common south squirrel monkeys associate with capuchin monkeys this may have more with foraging benefits the squirrel monkeys than predation cognition and communication black howler monkeys primate cognition great ape language primates have advanced cognitive some make tools and use them acquire food and for social some have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring influence and they are status manipulative and capable they can recognise kin and conspecifics and they can learn use symbols and understand aspects human language including some relational syntax and concepts number and numerical research primate cognition explores problem memory social theory mind and spatial and abstract comparative studies show trend towards higher intelligence going from prosimians new world monkeys old world and significantly higher average cognitive abilities the great however there great deal variation each group among new world both spider and capuchin monkeys have scored highly some well the results different lemurs lorises tarsiers and new world monkeys rely olfactory signals for many aspects social and reproductive specialized glands are used mark territories with pheromones which are detected the vomeronasal organ this process forms large part the communication behavior these old world monkeys and apes this ability mostly vestigial having regressed trichromatic eyes evolved become the main sensory primates also use gestures and facial expressions convey psychological the philippine tarsier has frequency limit auditory sensitivity approximately khz with dominant frequency such values are among the highest recorded for any terrestrial and relatively extreme example ultrasonic for philippine ultrasonic vocalizations might represent private channel communication that subverts detection prey and enhances energetic improves detection against frequency background life history crab eating macaque primates have slower rates development than other all primate infants are breastfed their mothers with the exception some human cultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed and rely them for grooming and some infants are protected and transported males the particularly males who may their other relatives the such siblings and may participate its care most primate mothers cease ovulation while breastfeeding once the infant weaned the mother can reproduce this often leads weaning conflict with infants who attempt continue infanticide common polygynous species such gray langurs and adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs the female will return estrus and thus they can sire offspring their social monogamy some species may have evolved combat this promiscuity may also lessen the risk infanticide since paternity becomes primates have longer juvenile period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals similar some primates such galagos and new world monkeys use holes for and park juveniles leafy patches while other primates follow strategy riding carrying individuals the body while adults may construct use nesting sometimes accompanied for the purpose behavior which has developed secondarily the great during the juvenile primates are more susceptible than adults predation and starvation they gain experience feeding and avoiding predators during this time they learn social and fighting often through primates especially have longer lifespans than other similarly sized this may partially due their slower late female catarrhine primates appear undergo cessation reproductive function known menopause other groups are less diet feeding and hunting mantled guereza white colobus primates exploit variety food has been said that many characteristics modern including derive from early practice taking most its food from the tropical most primates include fruit their diets obtain easily digested carbohydrates and lipids for however they require other such leaves for amino acids vitamins and minerals primates the suborder strepsirrhini tarsier are able synthesize vitamin like most other while primates the suborder haplorrhini monkeys and have lost this and require the vitamin their many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them exploit particular such leaves gum insects for leaf eaters such howler monkeys black white colobuses and sportive lemurs have extended digestive tracts which enable them absorb nutrients from leaves that can difficult marmosets which are gum have strong incisor teeth enabling them open tree bark get the and claws rather than enabling them cling trees while the aye aye combines like teeth with thin middle finger fill the same ecological niche taps trees find insect then gnaws holes the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger pull the larvae some species have additional for the grey cheeked mangabey has thick enamel its enabling open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys the gelada the only primate species that feeds primarily hunting tarsiers are the only extant obligate carnivorous primates exclusively eating crustaceans small vertebrates and snakes including venomous species capuchin monkeys can exploit many different types plant including leaves flowers buds nectar and but also eat insects and other invertebrates bird and small vertebrates such lizards squirrels and bats the common chimpanzee has varied diet that includes predation other primate such the western red colobus monkey this sometimes involves tool common chimpanzees sharpen sticks use weapons when hunting this considered the first evidence systematic use weapons species other than researchers documented occasions where wild chimpanzees fashioned sticks into spears hunt lesser bush babies galago senegalensis each chimpanzee modified branch breaking off one two ends frequently using its sharpened the the were about long and the chimpanzees then jabbed their spears into hollows tree trunks where bush babies there was single case which chimpanzee successfully extracted bush baby with the the bonobo omnivorous frugivore the majority its diet but supplements its diet with meat from small vertebrates such anomalures flying squirrels and duikers and invertebrates some bonobos have been shown consume order prey predators primates include various species carnivorans birds prey reptiles and other even gorillas have been recorded predators primates have diverse hunting strategies and primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis alarm calls and mobbing several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such borne dwelling predation may have shaped group size primates species exposed higher predation pressures appear live larger with their technology and increased modern humans are nearly free threats from predators and are themselves apex predators tool use and manufacture tool use animals tool use there are many reports primates using both the wild when the use tools primates varied and includes hunting invertebrates fish collecting processing food fruits vegetables and collecting weapons and jane goodall observed chimpanzee poking pieces grass into termite mound and then raising the grass his after goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was she found that the termites bit onto the grass with their the chimpanzee had been using the grass tool dip for there are more limited reports the closely related bonobo using tools the has been claimed they rarely use tools the wild although they use tools readily chimpanzees when has been reported that both female chimpanzees and bonobos use tools more avidly than orangutans borneo scoop catfish out small anthropologist anne russon saw several animals these forested islands learn their own jab catfish with that the panicked prey would flop out ponds and into the waiting there are few reports gorillas using tools the adult female western lowland gorilla used branch walking stick apparently test water depth and aid her crossing pool another adult female used detached trunk from small shrub stabilizer during food and another used log the striped capuchin was the first ape primate for which tool use was documented the individuals were observed cracking nuts placing them stone anvil and hitting them with another large thailand and crab eating macaques use stone tools open oysters and other and various types sea chacma baboons use stones stoning these baboons done from the rocky walls the canyon where they sleep and retreat when they are stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side the cliff fall directly the canyon although they have not been observed use tools the lemurs controlled settings have been shown capable understanding the functional properties the objects they had been trained use performing well using tool manufacture tool manufacture much rarer than simple tool use and probably represents higher cognitive soon after her initial discovery tool goodall observed other chimpanzees picking leafy stripping off the leaves and using the stems fish for this change leafy twig into tool was major prior scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used and that this ability was what separated humans from other both bonobos and chimpanzees have also been observed making sponges out leaves and moss that suck water and are used grooming sumatran
