protein navigation search protein protein myoglobin alpha helices ray crystallography prosthetic group heme group proteins are large biological molecules macromolecules consisting one more long chains amino acid residues proteins perform vast array functions within living including catalyzing metabolic reactions replicating dna responding stimuli and transporting molecules from one location proteins differ from one another primarily their sequence amino which dictated the nucleotide sequence their genes and which usually results folding the protein into specific three dimensional structure that determines its linear chain amino acid residues called polypeptide protein contains least one long short containing less than about residues are rarely considered proteins and are commonly called peptides sometimes the individual amino acid residues are bonded together peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid the sequence amino acid residues protein defined the sequence gene which encoded the genetic code the genetic code specifies standard amino however certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and certain archaea pyrrolysine shortly after even during the residues protein are often chemically modified posttranslational modification which alters the physical and chemical folding stability activity and the function the sometimes proteins have peptide groups which can called prosthetic groups cofactors proteins can also work together achieve particular and they often associate form stable protein complexes once proteins only exist for certain period time and are then degraded and recycled the machinery through the process protein turnover lifespan measured terms its half life and covers wide they can exist for minutes years with average lifespan days mammalian abnormal and misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due being targeted for destruction due being like other biological macromolecules such polysaccharides and nucleic acids proteins are essential parts organisms and participate virtually every process within cells many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital metabolism proteins also have structural mechanical such actin and myosin muscle and the proteins the cytoskeleton which form system scaffolding that maintains cell other proteins are important cell signaling immune responses cell adhesion and the cell cycle proteins are also necessary diets since animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and must obtain essential amino acids from through the process digestion animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids that are then used proteins may purified from other cellular components using variety techniques such ultracentrifugation precipitation electrophoresis and chromatography the advent genetic engineering has made possible number methods facilitate methods commonly used study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry site directed mutagenesis ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry contents biochemistry synthesis biosynthesis chemical synthesis structure structure

alanine resonance peptide bond polymer most proteins consist linear polymers built from series different amino acids all proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural including carbon which amino group carboxyl group and variable side chain are bonded only proline differs from this basic structure contains unusual ring the end amine which forces the amide moiety into fixed the side chains the standard amino detailed the list standard amino acids have great variety chemical structures and the combined effect all the amino acid side chains protein that ultimately determines its dimensional structure and its chemical the amino acids polypeptide chain are linked peptide bonds once linked the protein individual amino acid called residue and the linked series nitrogen and oxygen atoms are known the main chain protein the peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double bond character and inhibit rotation around its that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar the other two dihedral angles the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed the protein the end the protein with free carboxyl group known the terminus carboxy whereas the end with free amino group known the terminus amino the words protein polypeptide and peptide are little ambiguous and can overlap protein generally used refer the complete biological molecule stable conformation whereas peptide generally reserved for short amino acid oligomers often lacking stable dimensional however the boundary between the two not well defined and usually lies near residues polypeptide can refer any single linear chain amino usually regardless but often implies absence defined conformation synthesis biosynthesis protein biosynthesis dna encodes amino acid proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded genes each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that specified the nucleotide sequence the gene encoding this the genetic code set nucleotide sets called codons and each nucleotide combination designates amino for example aug adenine uracil guanine the code for methionine because dna contains four the total number possible codons hence there some redundancy the genetic with some amino acids specified more than one genes encoded dna are first transcribed into messenger rna proteins such rna polymerase most organisms then process the mrna also known primary transcript using various forms post transcriptional modification form the mature which then used template for protein synthesis the ribosome prokaryotes the mrna may either used soon bound ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid eukaryotes make mrna the cell nucleus and then translocate across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm where protein synthesis then takes the rate protein synthesis higher prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach amino acids per the process synthesizing protein from mrna template known translation the mrna loaded onto the ribosome and read three nucleotides time matching each codon its base pairing anticodon located transfer rna molecule which carries the amino acid corresponding the codon the enzyme aminoacyl trna synthetase charges the trna molecules with the correct amino the growing polypeptide often termed the nascent chain proteins are always biosynthesized from terminus terminus the size synthesized protein can measured the number amino acids contains and its total molecular mass which normally reported units daltons synonymous with atomic mass units the derivative unit kilodalton yeast proteins are average amino acids long and kda the largest known proteins are the titins component the muscle sarcomere with molecular mass almost kda and total length almost amino chemical synthesis short proteins can also synthesized chemically family methods known peptide synthesis which rely organic synthesis techniques such chemical ligation produce peptides high chemical synthesis allows for the introduction natural amino acids into polypeptide such attachment fluorescent probes amino acid side these methods are useful laboratory biochemistry and cell biology though generally not for commercial chemical synthesis inefficient for polypeptides longer than about amino and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure most chemical synthesis methods proceed from terminus opposite the biological structure protein structure protein structure prediction triose phosphate isomerase proteins fold into unique dimensional the shape into which protein naturally folds known its native conformation although many proteins can fold simply through the chemical properties their amino others require the aid molecular chaperones fold into their native biochemists often refer four distinct aspects primary structure the amino acid sequence protein polyamide secondary structure regularly repeating local structures stabilized hydrogen bonds the most common examples are the alpha helix beta sheet and turns because secondary structures are many regions different secondary structure can present the same protein tertiary structure the overall shape single protein the spatial relationship the secondary structures one tertiary structure generally stabilized nonlocal most commonly the formation hydrophobic core but also through salt bridges hydrogen disulfide bonds and even posttranslational modifications the term tertiary often used synonymous with the term fold the tertiary structure what controls the basic function the quaternary structure the structure formed several protein molecules polypeptide usually called protein subunits this which function single protein complex proteins are not entirely rigid addition these levels proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their the context these functional these tertiary quaternary structures are usually referred conformations and transitions between them are called conformational such changes are often induced the binding substrate molecule active site the physical region the protein that participates chemical solution proteins also undergo variation structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other immunoglobulin antibody hemoglobin insulin adenylate kinase glutamine synthetase proteins can informally divided into three main which correlate with typical tertiary globular proteins fibrous proteins and membrane proteins almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are fibrous proteins are often such collagen the major component connective keratin the protein component hair and membrane proteins often serve receptors provide channels for polar charged molecules pass through the cell membrane special case intramolecular hydrogen bonds within poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration are called dehydrons structure determination discovering the tertiary structure the quaternary structure its can provide important clues about how the protein performs its common experimental methods structure determination include ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy both which can produce information atomic resolution however nmr experiments are able provide information from which subset distances between pairs atoms can and the final possible conformations for protein are determined solving distance geometry problem dual polarisation interferometry quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due interactions other circular dichroism another laboratory technique for determining internal beta helical composition cryoelectron microscopy used produce resolution structural information about very large protein including assembled viruses variant known electron crystallography can also produce resolution information some especially for dimensional crystals membrane solved structures are usually deposited the protein data bank freely available resource from which structural data about thousands proteins can obtained the form cartesian coordinates for each atom the many more gene sequences are known than protein further the set solved structures biased toward proteins that can easily subjected the conditions required ray crystallography one the major structure determination globular proteins are comparatively easy crystallize preparation for ray membrane are difficult crystallize and are underrepresented the structural genomics initiatives have attempted remedy these deficiencies systematically solving representative structures major fold protein structure prediction methods attempt provide means generating plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally cellular

inert elements upon which proteins proteins make half the dry weight escherichia coli cell whereas other macromolecules such dna and rna make only and respectively the set proteins expressed particular cell cell type known its proteome hexokinase atp glucose the chief characteristic proteins that also allows their diverse set functions their ability bind other molecules specifically and the region the protein responsible for binding another molecule known the binding site and often depression pocket the molecular this binding ability mediated the tertiary structure the which defines the binding site and the chemical properties the surrounding amino side protein binding can extraordinarily tight and for the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds human angiogenin with femtomolar dissociation constant but does not bind all its amphibian homolog onconase extremely minor chemical changes such the addition single methyl group binding partner can sometimes suffice nearly eliminate for the aminoacyl trna synthetase specific the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain the amino acid isoleucine proteins can bind other proteins well small molecule substrates when proteins bind specifically other copies the same they can oligomerize form this process occurs often structural proteins that consist globular monomers that associate form rigid protein protein interactions also regulate enzymatic control progression through the cell cycle and allow the assembly large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with common biological proteins can also bind even integrated cell the ability binding partners induce conformational changes proteins allows the construction enormously complex signaling networks importantly interactions between proteins are and depend heavily the availability different groups partner proteins form aggregates that are capable carry out discrete sets study the interactions between specific proteins key understand important aspects cellular and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell enzymes enzyme the known role proteins the cell enzymes which catalyze chemical

signaling and ligand binding ribbon diagram cholera carbohydrate many proteins are involved the process cell signaling and signal transduction some such insulin are extracellular proteins that transmit signal from the cell which they were synthesized other cells distant tissues others are membrane proteins that act receptors whose main function bind signaling molecule and induce biochemical response the many receptors have binding site exposed the cell surface and effector domain within the which may have enzymatic activity may undergo conformational change detected other proteins within the antibodies are protein components adaptive immune system whose main function bind antigens foreign substances the and target them for antibodies can secreted into the extracellular environment anchored the membranes specialized cells known plasma cells whereas enzymes are limited their binding affinity for their substrates the necessity conducting their antibodies have such binding affinity its target extraordinarily many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them other locations the body multicellular these proteins must have high binding affinity when their ligand present high but must also release the ligand when present low concentrations the target the canonical example binding protein haemoglobin which transports oxygen from the lungs other organs and tissues all vertebrates and has close homologs every biological kingdom lectins are binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar lectins typically play role biological recognition phenomena involving cells and receptors and hormones are highly specific binding transmembrane proteins can also serve ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability the cell membrane small molecules and the membrane alone has hydrophobic core through which polar charged molecules cannot diffuse membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules enter and exit the many ion channel proteins are specialized select for only particular for potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one the two structural proteins structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity fluid biological most structural proteins are fibrous proteins for collagen and elastin are critical components connective tissue such cartilage and keratin found hard filamentous structures such hair nails feathers hooves and some animal shells some globular proteins can also play structural for actin and tubulin are globular and soluble but polymerize form stiff fibers that make the cytoskeleton which allows the cell maintain its shape and other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such myosin kinesin and dynein which are capable generating mechanical these proteins are crucial for cellular motility single celled organisms and the sperm many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually they also generate the forces exerted contracting muscles and play essential roles intracellular methods study protein methods the activities and structures proteins may examined vitro vivo and silico vitro studies purified proteins
