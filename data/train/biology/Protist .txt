protist navigation search neoproterozoic scientific classification eukarya fungi plantae animalia excavata euglenozoa percolozoa metamonada rhizaria cercozoa archaeplastida rhodophyta red glaucophyta basal green algae some unikonta amoebozoa choanozoa protists are large and diverse group eukaryotic microorganisms which belong the kingdom protista there have been attempts remove the kingdom from the taxonomy but still very much the use protoctista also preferred various organisations and molecular information has been used redefine this group modern taxonomy diverse and often distantly related phyla the group protists now considered mean diverse phyla that are not closely related through evolution and have different life cycles trophic levels modes locomotion and cellular besides their relatively simple levels the protists not have much they are they are multicellular without specialized tissues and this simple cellular organization distinguishes the protists from other such fungi animals and plants the term protista was first used ernst haeckel protists were traditionally subdivided into several groups based similarities the higher kingdoms the unicellular protozoa the protophyta mostly unicellular algae and the slime molds and water molds these traditional largely based superficial have been replaced classifications based phylogenetics evolutionary relatedness among however the older terms are still used informal names describe the morphology and ecology various protists live almost any environment that contains liquid many such the algae are photosynthetic and are vital primary producers particularly the ocean part the plankton other protists include pathogenic species such the kinetoplastid trypanosoma brucei which causes sleeping sickness and species the apicomplexan plasmodium which cause malaria contents classification historical classifications modern classifications metabolism reproduction role pathogens fossil record see also references bibliography general physiology ecology and paleontology external links classification historical classifications wikispecies protista the first groups used include microscopic organism were the animalcules and after the infusoria the when the german biologist georg august goldfuss introduced the word protozoa refer organisms such ciliates and corals this group was expanded include all unicellular animals such foraminifera and amoebae the formal taxonomic category protoctista was first proposed the early john hogg who argued that the protists should include what saw primitive unicellular forms both plants and defined the protoctista fourth kingdom addition the traditional kingdoms animals and the kingdom minerals was later removed from taxonomy ernst haeckel leaving animals and the protists kingdom primitive herbert copeland resurrected arguing that term protista included anucleated microbes such bacteria which the term protoctista literally meaning first established did copeland term included nucleated eukaryotes such diatoms green algae and fungi this classification was the basis for later definition fungi animalia plantae and protista the four kingdoms the kingdom protista was later modified separate prokaryotes into the separate kingdom monera leaving the protists group eukaryotic these five kingdoms remained the accepted classification until the development molecular phylogenetics the late when became apparent that neither protists nor monera were single groups related organisms they were not monophyletic groups some sometimes called ambiregnal have been considered both protozoa and algae fungi slime molds and mixotrophic algae and names for these have been published under either both the icn and the iczn modern classifications although systematists today not treat protists formal the term protist currently used two the most popular contemporary definition phylogenetic one that identifies paraphyletic group protist any eukaryote that not animal plant fungus excluding unicellular groups like the myxosporida microsporidia many chytridiomycetes and yeasts the other definition describes protists primarily functional biological protists are essentially those eukaryotes that are never that either exist independent they occur not show differentiation into excluding the brown algae and many red and green algae the term protozoa used refer heterotrophic species protists that not form these terms are not used current and are retained only convenient ways refer these citation needed the taxonomy protists still newer classifications attempt present monophyletic groups based ultrastructure biochemistry and genetics because the protists whole are paraphyletic such systems often split abandon the instead treating the protist groups separate lines the recent scheme adl example that does not bother with formal ranks class etc and instead lists organisms hierarchical this intended make the classification more stable the long term and easier some the main groups which may treated are listed the upper many are thought though there still for the excavates are probably not monophyletic and the chromalveolates are probably only monophyletic the haptophytes and cryptomonads are metabolism nutrition can vary according the type many protists are flagellate for and filter feeding can take place where the flagella find other protists can engulf bacteria and other food extending their cell membrane around them form food vacuole and digest them process termed phagocytosis phototrophs algae dinoflagellates euglena organotrophs apicomplexa trypanosomes amoebae reproduction some protists reproduce sexually gametes while others reproduce asexually binary fission some for example plasmodium falciparum have extremely complex life cycles that involve multiple forms the some which reproduce sexually and others however unclear how frequently sexual reproduction causes genetic exchange between different strains plasmodium nature and most populations parasitic protists may clonal lines that rarely exchange genes with other members their eukaryotes emerged evolution more than billion years the earliest eukaryotes were likely although sexual reproduction widespread among extant seemed unlikely until that sex could primordial and fundamental characteristic principal reason for this view was that sex appeared lacking certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family however several these protists are now known capable recently have had the capability meiosis and hence sexual for the common intestinal parasite giardia lamblia was once considered descendant protist lineage that predated the emergence meiosis and however lamblia was recently found have core set genes that function meiosis and that are widely present among sexual these results suggested that lamblia capable meiosis and thus sexual furthermore direct evidence for meiotic indicative was also found lamblia the pathogenic parasitic protists the genus leishmania have been shown capable sexual cycle the invertebrate likened the meiosis undertaken the trichomonas vaginalis parasitic not known undergo but when malik tested for genes that function they found including genes specific meiosis model these findings suggest that vaginalis may capable since the meiotic genes were also present lamblia appears that most these meiotic genes were likely present common ancestor vaginalis and lamblia these two species are descendants protist lineages that are highly divergent among leading malik suggest that these meiotic genes were likely present common ancestor all based phylogenetic dacks and roger proposed that facultative sex was present the common ancestor all this view was further supported study amoebae lahr amoeba have generally been regarded asexual however these authors describe evidence that most amoeboid lineages are anciently and that the majority asexual groups likely arose recently and protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental but tend reproduce sexually under stressful such starvation heat oxidative which associated with the production reactive oxygen species leading dna also appears important factor the induction sex role pathogens there are some protists that are significant pathogens animals and others that are pathogens plants for example there are five species the parasitic genus plasmodium which cause malaria and the oomycete phytophthora infestans which causes late blight more thorough understanding protist biology may allow these diseases treated more recent papers have proposed the use viruses treat infections caused protozoa researchers from the agricultural research service are taking advantage protists pathogens effort control red imported fire ant solenopsis invicta populations argentina with the help producing protists such kneallhazia solenopsae this more widely recognized belonging the fungus kingdom the red fire ant populations can reduced researchers have also found way infect phorid flies with the protist without harming the this important because the flies act vector infect the red fire ant population with the pathogenic fossil record many protists have hard parts produce resistant and their fossils are extremely rare the apicomplexans most ciliates some green algae the klebsormidiales choanoflagellates oomycetes brown algae yellow green algae excavates euglenids some these have been found preserved amber fossilized tree under unusual others are relativelly common the fossil the diatoms golden algae haptophytes silicoflagellates tintinnids dinoflagellates green algae red algae heliozoans radiolarians foraminiferans ebriids and testate amoebae euglyphids arcellaceans some are even used paleoecological indicators reconstruct ancient more probable eukaryote fossils begin appear about billion years the acritarchs spherical fossils likely algal another possible representant early fossil eukaryotes are the gabonionta see also evolution sexual reproduction protistology
