biology	rna navigation search rna nucleobases ribonucleic acid rna family large biological molecules that perform multiple vital roles the coding decoding regulation and expression genes together with dna rna comprises the nucleic acids which along with proteins constitute the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms life like rna assembled chain nucleotides but usually cellular organisms use messenger rna convey genetic information often notated using the letters and for the nucleotides guanine adenine uracil and cytosine that directs synthesis specific while many viruses encode their genetic information using rna genome some rna molecules play active role within cells catalyzing biological controlling gene expression sensing and communicating responses cellular one these active processes protein synthesis universal function whereby mrna molecules direct the assembly proteins ribosomes this process uses transfer rna molecules deliver amino acids the where ribosomal rna links amino acids together form contents comparison with dna structure synthesis types rna overview translation regulatory rnas rna processing rna genomes reverse transcription double stranded rna key discoveries rna biology see also references external links comparison with dna the chemical structure rna very similar that dna but differs three main unlike stranded rna stranded molecule many its biological roles and has much shorter chain however rna complementary base form intrastrand double while dna contains deoxyribose rna contains ribose deoxyribose there hydroxyl group attached the pentose ring the position these hydroxyl groups make rna less stable than dna because more prone hydrolysis the complementary base adenine not thymine but rather uracil which unmethylated form like most biologically active including mrna trna rrna snrnas and other non coding rnas contain complementary sequences that allow parts the rna fold and pair with itself form double analysis these rnas has revealed that they are highly unlike their structures not consist long double helices but rather collections short helices packed together into structures akin this rnas can achieve chemical catalysis like for determination the structure the enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond revealed that its active site composed entirely structure sirna each nucleotide rna contains ribose sugar with carbons numbered through base attached the position adenine cytosine guanine uracil adenine and guanine are purines cytosine and uracil are pyrimidines phosphate group attached the position one ribose and the position the the phosphate groups have negative charge each physiological making rna charged molecule the bases form hydrogen bonds between cytosine and between adenine and uracil and between guanine and however other interactions are such group adenine bases binding each other the gnra tetraloop that has adenine important structural feature rna that distinguishes from dna the presence hydroxyl group the position the ribose the presence this functional group causes the helix adopt the form geometry rather than the form most commonly observed this results very deep and narrow major groove and shallow and wide minor second consequence the presence the hydroxyl group that conformationally flexible regions rna molecule that not involved formation double can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond cleave the secondary structure telomerase rna rna transcribed with only four bases cytosine guanine and but these bases and attached sugars can modified numerous ways the rnas pseudouridine which the linkage between uracil and ribose changed from bond and ribothymidine are found various places the most notable ones being the loop trna another notable modified base deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside called inosine inosine plays key role the wobble hypothesis the genetic code there are more than other naturally occurring modified the greatest structural diversity modifications can found trna while pseudouridine and nucleosides with methylribose often present rrna are the most the specific roles many these modifications rna are not fully however notable ribosomal many the transcriptional modifications occur highly functional such the peptidyl transferase center and the subunit implying that they are important for normal the functional form stranded rna just like frequently requires specific tertiary structure the scaffold for this structure provided secondary structural elements that are hydrogen bonds within the this leads several recognizable domains secondary structure like hairpin loops bulges and internal since rna metal ions such are needed stabilise many secondary and tertiary structures synthesis synthesis rna usually catalyzed rna polymerase using dna process known transcription initiation transcription begins with the binding the enzyme promoter sequence the dna usually found upstream the dna double helix unwound the helicase activity the the enzyme then progresses along the template strand the direction synthesizing complementary rna molecule with elongation occurring the direction the dna sequence also dictates where termination rna synthesis will primary transcript rnas are often modified enzymes after for poly tail and cap are added eukaryotic pre mrna and introns are removed the spliceosome there are also number rna dependent rna polymerases that use rna their template for synthesis new strand for number rna viruses such use this type enzyme replicate their genetic also rna dependent rna polymerase part the rna interference pathway many types rna list rnas overview hammerhead ribozyme messenger rna the rna that carries information from dna the ribosome the sites protein synthesis translation the the coding sequence the mrna determines the amino acid sequence the protein that many rnas not code for protein however about the transcriptional output coding eukaryotes these called non coding rnas ncrna can encoded their own genes rna but can also derive from mrna introns the most prominent examples coding rnas are transfer rna and ribosomal rna both which are involved the process there are also coding rnas involved gene rna processing and other certain rnas are able catalyse chemical reactions such cutting and ligating other rna and the catalysis peptide bond formation the ribosome these are known ribozymes translation messenger rna carries information about protein sequence the ribosomes the protein synthesis factories the coded that every three nucleotides correspond one amino eukaryotic cells once precursor mrna has been transcribed from processed mature this removes its introns coding sections the the mrna then exported from the nucleus the where bound ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help trna prokaryotic which not have nucleus and cytoplasm mrna can bind ribosomes while being transcribed from after certain amount time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance ribonucleases transfer rna small rna chain about nucleotides that transfers specific amino acid growing polypeptide chain the ribosomal site protein synthesis during has sites for amino acid attachment and anticodon region for codon recognition that binds specific sequence the messenger rna chain through hydrogen ribosomal rna the catalytic component the eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rrna and three the rrna molecules are synthesized the nucleolus and one synthesized the ribosomal rna and protein combine form nucleoprotein called the ribosome binds mrna and carries out protein several ribosomes may attached single mrna any nearly all the rna found typical eukaryotic cell transfer messenger rna found many bacteria and plastids tags proteins encoded mrnas that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from regulatory rnas several types rna can downregulate gene expression being complementary part mrna micrornas are found eukaryotes and act through rna interference where effector complex mirna and enzymes can cleave complementary block the mrna from being accelerate its while small interfering rnas are often produced breakdown viral there are also endogenous sources sirnas act through rna interference fashion similar some mirnas and sirnas can cause genes they target methylated thereby decreasing increasing transcription those animals have piwi interacting rnas that are active germline cells and are thought defense against transposons and play role gametogenesis many prokaryotes have crispr rnas regulatory system similar rna antisense rnas are most downregulate but few are activators one way antisense rna can act binding forming stranded rna that enzymatically there are many long noncoding rnas that regulate genes one such rna xist which coats one chromosome female mammals and inactivates mrna may contain regulatory elements such riboswitches the untranslated region untranslated region these cis regulatory elements regulate the activity that the untranslated regions can also contain elements that regulate other rna processing many rnas are involved modifying other introns are spliced out pre mrna spliceosomes which contain several small nuclear rnas the introns can ribozymes that are spliced rna can also altered having its nucleotides modified other nucleotides than and modifications rna nucleotides are general directed small nucleolar rnas found the nucleolus and cajal bodies snornas associate with enzymes and guide them spot rna basepairing that these enzymes then perform the nucleotide rrnas and trnas are extensively but snrnas and mrnas can also the target base rna can also rna genomes like rna can carry genetic rna viruses have genomes composed rna that encodes number the viral genome replicated some those while other proteins protect the genome the virus particle moves new host viroids are another group but they consist only not encode any protein and are replicated host plant reverse transcription reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes reverse transcribing dna copies from their these dna copies are then transcribed new retrotransposons also spread copying dna and rna from one and telomerase contains rna that used template for building the ends eukaryotic double stranded rna double stranded rna rna with two complementary similar the dna found all dsrna forms the genetic material some viruses double stranded rna viruses double stranded rna such viral rna sirna can trigger rna interference eukaryotes well interferon response vertebrates key discoveries rna biology history rna biology research rna has led many important biological discoveries and numerous nobel nucleic acids were discovered friedrich miescher who called the material since was found the nucleus was later discovered that prokaryotic which not have also contain nucleic the role rna protein synthesis was suspected already severo ochoa won the nobel prize medicine shared with arthur kornberg after discovered enzyme that can synthesize rna the however the enzyme discovered ochoa polynucleotide phosphorylase was later shown responsible for rna not rna alex rich and david davies hybridized two separate strands rna form the first crystal rna whose structure could determined ray the sequence the nucleotides yeast trna was found robert holley winning holley the nobel prize medicine shared with har gobind khorana and marshall nirenberg carl woese hypothesized that rna might catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms life replicating could have relied rna both carry genetic information and catalyze biochemical rna world during the early retroviruses and reverse transcriptase were showing for the first time that enzymes could copy rna into dna the opposite the usual route for transmission genetic for this david baltimore renato dulbecco and howard temin were awarded nobel prize walter fiers and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence rna virus that bacteriophage introns and rna splicing were discovered both mammalian viruses and cellular resulting nobel philip sharp and richard roberts catalytic rna molecules ribozymes were discovered the early leading nobel award thomas cech and sidney altman was found petunia that introduced genes can silence similar genes the now known result rna interference about the same long now called micrornas were found have role the development elegans studies rna interference gleaned nobel prize for andrew fire and craig mello and another nobel was awarded for studies transcription rna roger kornberg the same the discovery gene regulatory rnas has led attempts
