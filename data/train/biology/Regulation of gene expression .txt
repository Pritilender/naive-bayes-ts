gene expression includes wide range mechanisms that are used cells increase decrease the production specific gene products protein rna and informally termed gene regulation sophisticated programs gene expression are widely observed for example trigger developmental respond environmental adapt new food virtually any step gene expression can from transcriptional initiation rna processing and the post translational modification gene regulation essential for viruses prokaryotes and eukaryotes increases the versatility and adaptability organism allowing the cell express protein when although early barbara mcclintock showed interaction between two genetic activator and dissociator the color formation maize the first discovery gene regulation system widely considered the identification the lac operon discovered jacques monod which some enzymes involved lactose metabolism are expressed the genome coli only the presence lactose and absence furthermore multicellular gene regulation drives the processes cellular differentiation and morphogenesis leading the creation different cell types that possess different gene expression and hence produce different have different ultrastructures that

stages where gene expression the most extensively utilised point transcription chromatin domains transcription transcriptional modification rna transport translation mrna degradation modification dna the accessibility large regions dna can depend its chromatin which can altered result histone modifications directed dna methylation ncrna dna binding protein hence these modifications may down regulate the expression certain these modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and are referred epigenetic regulation structural transcription dna dictated its the density its packing indicative the frequency octameric protein complexes called nucleosomes are responsible for the amount supercoiling and these complexes can temporarily modified processes such phosphorylation more permanently modified processes such methylation such modifications are considered responsible for more less permanent changes gene expression chemical methylation dna common method gene dna typically methylated methyltransferase enzymes cytosine nucleotides cpg dinucleotide sequence also called cpg islands when densely analysis the pattern methylation given region dna which can can achieved through method called bisulfite methylated cytosine residues are unchanged the whereas unmethylated ones are changed the differences are analyzed dna sequencing methods developed quantify such pyrosequencing biotage massarray sequenom measuring the relative amounts the abnormal methylation patterns are thought involved histone acetylation also important process histone acetyltransferase enzymes such creb binding protein also dissociate the dna from the histone allowing transcription often dna methylation and histone deacetylation work together gene silencing the combination the two seems signal for dna packed more lowering gene citation needed regulation transcription transcriptional regulation rna repressor promoter operator lactose lacz lacy laca top bottom regulation transcription thus controls when transcription occurs and how much rna transcription gene rna polymerase can regulated least five specificity factors alter the specificity rna polymerase for given promoter set making more less likely bind them sigma factors used prokaryotic transcription repressors bind the operator coding sequences the dna strand that are close overlapping the promoter impeding rna progress along the thus impeding the expression the the image the right demonstrates regulation repressor the lac general transcription factors position rna polymerase the start coding sequence and then release the polymerase transcribe the activators enhance the interaction between rna polymerase and particular promoter encouraging the expression the activators this increasing the attraction rna polymerase for the through interactions with subunits the rna polymerase indirectly changing the structure the enhancers are sites the dna helix that are bound activators order loop the dna bringing specific promoter the initiation enhancers are much more common eukaryote than where only few examples exist silencers are regions dna sequences when bound particular transcription can silence expression the post transcriptional regulation post transcriptional regulation after the dna transcribed and mrna there must some sort regulation how much the mrna translated into cells this modulating the splicing addition tail the specific nuclear export and several sequestration the rna these processes occur eukaryotes but not this modulation result protein transcript regulated and may have affinity for certain regulation translation translational regulation the translation mrna can also controlled number mostly the level recruitment the small ribosomal subunit can indeed modulated mrna secondary antisense rna protein both prokaryotes and large number rna binding proteins which often are directed their target sequence the secondary structure the which may change depending certain such temperature presence ligand some transcripts act ribozymes and regulate their examples gene regulation enzyme induction process which molecule induces initiates the expression

gene typically into early and late using collinear systems regulated terminators lambda phage splicing modulators hiv developmental biology morphogen large number studied regulatory systems come from developmental examples the colinearity the hox gene cluster with their nested posterior patterning has been speculated that pattern generation the hand digits interdigits the gradient sonic hedgehog secreted inducing from the zone polarizing activity the which creates gradient active which activates which inhibits bmps also secreted the resulting the formation alternating pattern activity result this reaction diffusion system somitogenesis the creation segments from uniform tissue somitic psm they are formed sequentially from anterior this achieved amniotes possibly means two opposing retinoic acid the anterior and wnt and fgf the coupled oscillating pattern segmentation composed fgf notch and wnt sex determination the soma drosophila requires the sensing the ratio autosomal genes sex encoded which results the production sexless splicing factor resulting the female isoform circuitry gene regulatory network regulation and regulation regulation process that occurs within cell triggered signal originating internal external the which results increased expression one more genes and result the encoded those the down regulation process resulting decreased gene and corresponding protein regulation occurs for when cell deficient some kind this more receptor protein synthesized and transported the membrane the cell thus the sensitivity the cell brought back reestablishing homeostasis down regulation occurs for when cell overstimulated neurotransmitter hormone drug for prolonged period and the expression the receptor protein decreased order protect the cell see also tachyphylaxis inducible repressible systems gene regulation can summarized the response the respective inducible systems inducible system off unless there the presence some molecule called that allows for gene the molecule said induce the manner which this happens dependent the control mechanisms well differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic repressible systems repressible system except the presence some molecule called that suppresses gene the molecule said repress the manner which this happens dependent the control mechanisms well differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic theoretical circuits repressor activation sensor results the change expression gene negative the gene product downregulates its own production directly which can result keeping transcript levels proportional factor inhibition away reactions when coupled with positive feedback loop creating oscillator taking advantage the time delay transcription and given that the mrna and protein life shorter positive the gene product upregulates its own production directly which can result signal amplification bistable switches when two genes inhibit each other and both have positive feedback pattern generation methods nucleic acid methods protein methods most experiments investigating differential expression used whole cell extracts called state determine which genes changed and how much they these however not informative where the regulation has occurred and may actually mask conflicting regulatory processess see post transcriptional regulation but still the most commonly analysed quantitative pcr and dna microarray when studying gene there are several methods look the various eukaryotes these the local chromatin environment the region can determined chip chip analysis pulling down rna polymerase histone modifications trithorax group protein polycomb group protein any other binding element which good antibody epistatic interactions can investigated synthetic genetic array analysis due transcriptional transcription rates and total rna levels differ measure the transcription rates nuclear assays can done and newer throughput methods are being using thiol labelling instead radioactivity only the rna polymerised the nucleus actually and not only abortive products and sense transcripts are therefore the differences nuclear and cytoplasmic levels can see separating
