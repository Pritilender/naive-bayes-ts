biology	slime mold navigation search slime bacteria molds diachea leucopodia stemonitis fusca scotland fuligo septica ernst haeckel kunstformen der natur slime mold slime mould broad term describing some organisms that use spores slime molds were formerly classified fungi but are longer considered part this kingdom although not related one they are still sometimes grouped for convenience within the paraphyletic group referred kingdom protista found wide variety more than species slime mold occur all over the their common name refers part some these life cycles where they can appear gelatinous slime this mostly seen with the myxogastria which are the only macroscopic slime citation needed most slime molds are smaller than few but some species may reach sizes several square meters and masses many slime namely the cellular slime actually not spend most their time this long food these slime molds exist celled when food short many these celled organisms will congregate and start moving single this state they are sensitive airborne chemicals and can detect food they can readily change the shape and function parts and may form stalks that produce fruiting releasing countless light enough carried the wind hitch ride passing they feed microorganisms that live any type dead plant they contribute the decomposition dead and feed yeasts and for this slime molds are usually found soil lawns and the forest floor commonly deciduous logs however tropical areas they are also common inflorescences fruits and aerial situations the canopy urban they are found mulch even the leaf mold gutters and also grow air especially when the drain one the most commonly encountered slime molds the yellow physarum polycephalum found both nature forests temperate zones well classrooms and laboratories contents taxonomy older classification modern classification life cycle plasmodia behavior see also references external links taxonomy older classification slime are polyphyletic they were originally represented the subkingdom gymnomycota the fungi kingdom and included the defunct phyla myxomycota acrasiomycota and labyrinthulomycota today slime molds have been divided between several none which included the kingdom slime molds can generally divided into two main plasmodial slime mold enclosed within single membrane without walls and one large this supercell syncytium essentially bag cytoplasm containing thousands individual see heterokaryosis cellular slime molds spend most their lives individual unicellular protists but when chemical signal they assemble into cluster that acts one modern classification more strict slime molds comprise the mycetozoan group the amoebozoa mycetozoa include the following three myxogastria syncytial plasmodial slime molds dictyosteliida cellular slime protosteloids even this level classification there are conflicts recent molecular evidence shows that the first two groups are likely monophyletic and the protosteloids however for this scientists are currently trying understand the relationships among these three physarum polycephalum the most commonly encountered are the myxogastria common slime mold which forms tiny brown tufts rotting logs stemonitis another form which lives rotting logs and often used research physarum polycephalum logs has the appearance slimy work yellow few feet fuligo forms yellow crusts the dictyosteliida cellular slime are distantly related the plasmodial slime molds and have very different their amoebae not form huge coenocytes and remain they live similar habitats and feed when food runs out and they are ready form they something radically they release signal molecules into their which they find each other and create these amoeba then join into tiny multicellular like coordinated which crawls open lit place and grows into fruiting some the amoebae become spores begin the next but some the amoebae sacrifice themselves become dead lifting the spores into the the protosteloids have characters intermediate between the previous two but they are much the fruiting bodies only forming one few spores non amoebozoan slime moulds acrasids order slime molds which belong the heterolobosea within the super group excavata they have similar life style dictyostelids but their amoebae behave having eruptive they used belong the defunct phylum plasmodiophorids order parasitic protists which belong the super group rhizaria they can cause cabbage club root disease and powdery scab tuber disease the plasmodiophorids also form coenocytes but are internal parasites plants club root disease labyrinthulomycota slime nets which belong the super group chromalveolata the class they are marine and form labyrinthine networks tubes which amoeba without pseudopods can

labyrinthuloides japonochytrium schizochytrium thraustochytrium ulkenia diplophryids diplophrys fonticulida fonticula life cycle slime molds begin life amoeba like cells these unicellular amoebae are commonly haploid and multiply they encounter their favorite bacteria these amoebae can mate they encounter the correct mating type and form zygotes which then grow into plasmodia these contain many nuclei without cell membranes between which can grow meters the species fuligo septica often seen slimy yellow network and rotting the amoebae and the plasmodia engulf the plasmodium grows into interconnected network protoplasmic within each protoplasmic strand the cytoplasmic contents rapidly one strand carefully watched for about seconds the cytoplasm can seen stop and then reverse the streaming protoplasm within plasmodial strand can reach speeds per second which the fastest rate recorded for any migration the plasmodium accomplished when more protoplasm streams advancing areas and protoplasm withdrawn from rear when the food supply the plasmodium will migrate the surface its substrate and transform into rigid fruiting the fruiting bodies sporangia are what commonly they superficially look like fungi molds but are not related the true these sporangia will then release spores which hatch into amoebae begin the life cycle plasmodia enteridium lycoperdon myxogastria the plasmoidal portion the life cycle only occurs after syngamy which the fusion cytoplasm and nuclei myxoamoebae swarm the diploid zygote becomes multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell myxomycete plasmodia are multinucleate masses protoplasm that move cytoplasmic order for the plasmodium cytoplasm must diverted towards the leading edge from the lagging this process results the plasmodium advancing like plasmodium also gains nutrients through the phagocytosis bacteria and small pieces organic the plasmodium also has the ability subdivide and establish separate conversely separate plasmodia that are genetically similar and compatible can fuse together create larger the event that conditions become the plasmodium will form essentially dry and dormant the event that conditions become moist again the sclerotium absorbs water and active plasmodium when the food supply the myxomycete plasmodium will enter the next stage its life cycle forming haploid spores often defined sporangium other bearing behavior when slime mold mass mound physically the cells find their way back studies physarum have even shown ability learn and predict periodic unfavorable conditions laboratory experiments saigusa professor john tyler bonner who has spent lifetime studying slime molds argues that they are more than bag amoebae encased thin slime yet they manage have various behaviours that are equal those animals who possess muscles and nerves with ganglia that simple atsushi tero hokkaido university grew the slime mold physarum polycephalum flat
