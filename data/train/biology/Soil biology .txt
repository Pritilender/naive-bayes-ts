soil biology navigation search soil biology the study microbial and faunal activity and ecology soil soil life soil biota soil fauna edaphon collective term that encompasses all the organisms that spend significant portion their life cycle within soil the litter these organisms include earthworms nematodes protozoa fungi bacteria and different arthropods soil biology plays vital role determining many soil the decomposition organic matter soil organisms has immense influence soil plant soil and carbon relatively new much remains unknown about soil biology and their effects soil contents overview soil life table scope bacteria nitrification nitrogen fixation denitrification actinobacteria fungi mycorrhizae earthworms ants and termites see also references bibliography external links overview the soil home large proportion the biodiversity the links between soil organisms and soil functions are observed incredibly the interconnectedness and complexity this soil food means any appraisal soil function must necessarily take into account interactions with the living communities that exist within the know that soil organisms break down organic matter making nutrients available for uptake plants and other the nutrients stored the bodies soil organisms prevent nutrient loss leaching microbial exudates act maintain soil structure and earthworms are important bioturbation however find that understand critical aspects about how these populations function and the discovery glomalin indicates that lack the knowledge correctly answer some the most basic questions about the biogeochemical cycle have much work ahead gain better understanding how soil biological components affect and the biosphere balanced plants grow active and steady the mineral content the soil and its heartiful structure are important for their but the life the earth that powers its cycles and provides its without the activities soil organic materials would accumulate and litter the soil and there would food for the soil biota megafauna size range moles rabbits and rodents macrofauna size range woodlice earthworms beetles centipedes slugs snails ants and harvestmen mesofauna size range micrometres tardigrades mites and springtails microfauna and size range micrometres yeasts bacteria commonly actinobacteria fungi protozoa roundworms and rotifers bacteria and fungi play key roles maintaining healthy they act decomposers that break down organic materials produce detritus and other breakdown soil detritivores like ingest detritus and decompose saprotrophs well represented fungi and extract soluble nutrients from the ants help breaking down the same way but they also provide the motion part they move their also the wood eaters help the soil more soil

development and contribution study microbial and faunal diversity and population dynamics genetic influence environmental factors community ecology and functioning interactions between organisms and mineral organic compounds involvement such interactions soil pathogenicity transformation mineral and organic cycling elements soil structuration complementary disciplinary approaches are necessarily utilized which involve molecular biology genetics ecophysiology biogeography ecology soil organic nutrient dynamics and landscape ecology bacteria bacteria are cell organisms and the most numerous denizens with populations ranging from million billion they are capable very rapid reproduction binary fission dividing into favourable one bacterium capable producing million more just hours most soil bacteria live close plant roots and are often referred bacteria live soil including the film moisture surrounding soil and some are able swim means flagella the majority the beneficial dwelling bacteria need oxygen and are thus termed aerobic bacteria whilst those that not require air are referred anaerobic and tend cause putrefaction dead organic aerobic bacteria are most active soil that moist but not this will deprive aerobic bacteria the air that they and neutral soil and where there plenty food carbohydrates and micronutrients from organic available hostile conditions will not completely kill rather the bacteria will stop growing and get into dormant and those individuals with adaptive mutations may compete better the new some gram positive bacteria produce spores order wait for more favourable and gram negative bacteria get into nonculturable stage bacteria are colonized persistent viral agents bacteriophages that determine gene word order bacterial from the organic point the important roles that bacteria play nitrification nitrification vital part the nitrogen cycle wherein certain bacteria which manufacture their own carbohydrate supply without using the process are able transform nitrogen the form ammonium which produced the decomposition proteins into nitrates which are available growing and once again converted nitrogen fixation another part the the process nitrogen fixation constantly puts additional nitrogen into biological this carried out living fixing bacteria the soil water such azotobacter those that live close symbiosis with leguminous plants such rhizobia these bacteria form colonies nodules they create the roots peas beans and related these are able convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into containing organic denitrification while nitrogen fixation converts nitrogen from the atmosphere into organic series processes called denitrification returns approximately equal amount nitrogen the denitrifying bacteria tend facultatively anaerobes can alter between the oxygen dependent and oxygen independent types including achromobacter and pseudomonas the purification process caused free conditions converts nitrates and nitrites soil into nitrogen gas into gaseous compounds such nitrous oxide nitric oxide denitrification can lead overall losses available soil nitrogen and subsequent loss soil however fixed nitrogen may circulate many times between organisms and the soil before denitrification returns the the diagram above illustrates the nitrogen actinobacteria actinobacteria are critical the decomposition organic matter and humus formation and their presence responsible for the sweet earthy aroma associated with good healthy they require plenty air and between and but are more tolerant dry conditions than most other bacteria and fungi gram garden soil can contain around one million fungi such yeasts and moulds fungi have chlorophyll and are not able photosynthesise they cannot use atmospheric carbon dioxide source therefore they are chemo heterotrophic meaning like animals they require chemical source energy rather than being able use light energy well organic substrates get carbon for growth and many fungi are often causing disease their living host although some have beneficial relationships with living illustrated terms soil and humus the most important fungi tend saprotrophic that they live dead decaying organic thus breaking down and converting forms that are available the higher succession fungi species will colonise the dead beginning with those that use sugars and which are succeeded those that are able break down cellulose and lignins fungi spread underground sending long thin threads known mycelium throughout the these threads can observed throughout many soils and compost heaps from the mycelia the fungi able throw its fruiting the visible part above the soil mushrooms toadstools and puffballs which may contain millions spores when the fruiting body bursts these spores are dispersed through the air settle fresh and are able lie dormant for years until the right conditions for their activation arise the right food made mycorrhizae those fungi that are able live symbiotically with living creating relationship that beneficial are known mycorrhizae from myco meaning fungal and rhiza meaning plant root hairs are invaded the mycelia the which lives partly the soil and partly the and may either cover the length the root hair sheath concentrated around its the mycorrhiza obtains the carbohydrates that requires from the return providing the plant with nutrients including nitrogen and later the plant roots will also absorb the mycelium into its own beneficial mycorrhizal associations are found many our edible and flowering shewell cooper suggests that these include least the brassica and solanum families including tomatoes and potatoes well the majority tree species especially forest and here the mycorrhizae create fine underground mesh that extends greatly beyond the limits the greatly increasing their feeding range and actually causing neighbouring trees become physically the benefits mycorrhizal relations their plant partners are not limited but can essential for plant situations where little light able reach the forest such the north american pine forests young seedling cannot obtain sufficient light photosynthesise for itself and will not grow properly sterile but the ground underlain mycorrhizal then the developing seedling will throw down roots that can link with the fungal threads and through them obtain the nutrients often indirectly obtained from its parents neighbouring david attenborough points out the fungi animal relationship that creates three way harmonious found forest ecosystems wherein the fungi symbiosis enhanced animals such the wild deer mice flying which feed upon the fruiting including and cause their further spread private life plants greater understanding the complex relationships that pervade natural systems one the major justifications the organic gardener refraining from the use artificial chemicals and the damage these might citation needed recent research has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce glomalin protein that binds soil particles and stores both carbon and these related soil proteins are important part soil organic matter earthworms ants and termites earthworms ants and termites mix the soil they significantly affecting soil earthworms ingest soil particles and organic enhancing the availability plant nutrients the material that passes through and out their aerating and stirring the and increasing the stability soil these organisms help assure the ready infiltration see also soil zoology soil ecology nitrification nitrogen
