alphanumeric human for sapiens integrated taxonomic information system provides unique number for each difficulty defining species and identifying particular species species problem surprisingly difficult define the word species way that applies all naturally occurring and the debate among biologists about how define species and how identify actual species called the species problem over two dozen distinct definitions species are use amongst most textbooks follow ernst known the biological species concept species groups actually potentially interbreeding natural which are reproductively isolated from other such has been argued that this definition species not only useful but also natural consequence the effect sexual reproduction the dynamics natural also see speciation various parts this definition serve exclude some unusual artificial those that occur only captivity when the normal mating partners may not result deliberate human action animals that may physically and physiologically capable mating for various not normally the wild the typical textbook definition above works well for most multi celled organisms but there are several types situations which breaks definition applies only organisms that reproduce sexually does not work for asexually reproducing single celled organisms and for the relatively few parthenogenetic apomictic multi celled the term phylotype often applied such biologists frequently not know whether two morphologically similar groups organisms are potentially capable there considerable variation the degree which hybridization may succeed under natural even the degree which some organisms use sexual reproduction between individuals ring species members adjacent populations interbreed successfully but members some adjacent populations few cases may physically impossible for animals that are members the same species however these are such breeds which human intervention has caused gross morphological and are therefore excluded the biological species dubious discuss horizontal gene transfer makes even more difficult define the word species there strong evidence horizontal gene transfer between very dissimilar groups prokaryotes and least occasionally between dissimilar groups eukaryotes and williamson argues that there evidence for some crustaceans and echinoderms all definitions the word species assume that organism gets all its genes from one two parents that are very like that but horizontal gene transfer makes that assumption charles darwin wrote chapter the origin species one definition has satisfied all yet every naturalist knows vaguely what means when speaks generally the term includes the unknown element distinct act but the descent man when addressing the question whether mankind consists one several darwin revised his opinion hopeless endeavour decide this point sound until some definition the term species generally and the definition must not include element that cannot possibly such act definitions species this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and may prior naturalists viewed species ideal general which could exemplified ideal specimen bearing all the traits general the darwin theories shifted attention from uniformity variation and from the general the according intellectual historian louis menand finches this shift results new approach species darwin concluded that species are what they appear ideas which are provisionally useful for naming groups interacting look the term one arbitrarily given for the sake convenience set individuals closely resembling each does not essentially differ from the word which given less distinct and more fluctuating the term again comparison with mere individual also applied and for convenience practically biologists define species populations organisms that have high level genetic similarity this may reflect adaptation the same and the transfer genetic material from one individual through variety possible the exact level similarity used such definition but this the most common definition used for organisms that reproduce asexually asexual reproduction such some plants and microorganisms this lack any clear species concept microbiology has led some authors arguing that the term species not useful when studying bacterial who instead they see genes moving freely between even distantly related with the entire bacterial domain being single gene nevertheless kind rule thumb has been saying that species bacteria archaea with rrna gene sequences more similar than each other need checked dna dna hybridization they belong the same species this concept has been updated saying that the border was too low and can raised the study sexually reproducing where genetic material shared through the process the ability two organisms interbreed and produce fertile offspring both sexes generally accepted simple indicator that the organisms share enough genes considered members the same thus species group interbreeding this definition can extended say that species group organisms that could potentially interbreed fish could still classed the same species even they live different long they could still interbreed were they ever come into contact with each the other there are many examples series three more distinct where individuals the population the middle can interbreed with the populations either but individuals the populations either side cannot thus one could argue that these populations constitute single two distinct this not evidence that species are defined gene and thus have fuzzy consequently any universal definition species necessarily instead biologists have proposed range which definition biologists uses pragmatic depending the particularities that these definitions often and the differences between them are more matter emphasis than outright nevertheless species concept yet proposed entirely can applied all cases without resorting given the complexity some have argued that such objective definition all likelihood and biologists should settle for the most practical for most vertebrates this the biological species concept and lesser extent for different the phylogenetic species concept many bsc subspecies are considered species under the the difference between the bsc and the psc can summed insofar that the bsc defines species consequence manifest evolutionary history while the psc defines species consequence manifest evolutionary potential thus psc species made soon evolutionary lineage has started while bsc species starts exist only when the lineage separation accordingly there can considerable conflict between alternative classifications based upon the psc versus they differ completely their treatment taxa that would considered subspecies under the latter model the numerous subspecies honey bees typological species

identical other relationships beyond that group were aristotle used the words genus and species mean generic and specific aristotle and other darwinian scientists took the species distinct and with essence like the chemical elements when early observers began develop systems organization for living they began place formerly isolated species into many these early delineation schemes would now considered whimsical and these included consanguinity based color all plants with yellow behavior scorpions and certain biting john ray english was the first give biological definition the term the century swedish scientist carolus linnaeus classified organisms according easily observed although his system classification sorts organisms according degrees made claims about the relationship between similar that was still widely believed that there was organic connection between matter how similar they this view was influenced european scholarly and religious education the which held that the categories life are dictated hierarchical scheme although there are always differences although sometimes between individual linnaeus strove identify individual organisms that were exemplary the and considered other exemplary organisms deviant and citation needed the century most naturalists understood that species could change form over and that the history the planet provided enough time for major jean baptiste lamarck his zoological philosophy offered one the first logical arguments against creationism the new emphasis was determining how species could change over lamarck suggested that organism could pass acquired trait its the giraffe long neck was attributed generations giraffes stretching reach the leaves higher treetops this known and simplistic however does not justice the breadth and subtlety with the acceptance the natural selection idea charles darwin the however lamarck view oriented also known teleological process was recent interest inheritance acquired characteristics centers around epigenetic processes methylation that not affect dna but instead alter expression inheritable thus neo lamarckism sometimes not challenge the theory evolution natural charles darwin and alfred wallace provided what scientists now consider the most powerful and compelling theory evolution darwin argued that was populations that not his argument relied radical shift perspective from that rather than defining species ideal terms and searching for ideal representative and rejecting darwin considered variation among individuals further argued that far from being actually provides the explanation for the existence distinct darwin work drew thomas malthus insight that the rate growth biological population will always outpace the rate growth the resources the such the food darwin not all the members population will able survive and those that did the ones possessing however that make them slightly better adapted the these variable traits are then the offspring the survivors will also possess thus over many adaptive variations will accumulate the while adaptive traits will tend whether variation adaptive adaptive depends the different environments favor different since the environment effectively selects which organisms live the environment the fight for that selects the traits passed this the theory evolution natural selection this the length neck would explained positing that giraffes with longer necks would have had significant reproductive advantage those with shorter over many the entire population would species necked when darwin published his theory natural the mechanism behind the inheritance individual traits was although darwin made some speculations how traits are inherited pangenesis his theory relies only the fact that inheritable traits exist and are variable which makes his accomplishment even more although gregor mendel paper genetics was published its significance was not was not until that his work was rediscovered hugo vries carl correns and erich von tschermak who realised that the inheritable theory are genes the theory the evolution species through natural selection has two important implications for discussions consequences that fundamentally challenge the assumptions behind taxonomy first suggests that species are not just they may actually some students darwin argue that all species are descended from common second supposes that species are not fixed permanent members species are all and over time species this suggests that species not have any clear boundaries but are rather momentary statistical effects constantly changing one may still use taxonomy identify individual plants and but one can longer think species independent and the rise new species from parental line called speciation there clear line demarcating the ancestral species from the descendant although the current scientific understanding species suggests that there rigorous and comprehensive way distinguish between different species all cases biologists continue seek concrete ways operationalize the one the most popular biological definitions species terms reproductive two creatures cannot reproduce produce fertile offspring both then they are different this definition captures number intuitive species but remains has nothing say about species that reproduce for and very difficult apply extinct moreover boundaries between species are often there are examples where members one population can produce fertile offspring both sexes with second and members the second population can produce fertile offspring both sexes with members third but members the first and third population cannot produce fertile can only produce fertile offspring the homozygous consequently some people reject this definition richard dawkins defines two organisms conspecific and only they have the same number chromosomes and for each both organisms have the same number nucleotides the blind watchmaker however most not all taxonomists would strongly disagree citation needed for many amphibians most notably new leiopelma frogs the genome consists core chromosomes that are mostly invariable and accessory which exist number possible even though the chromosome numbers are highly variable between these can interbreed successfully and form single evolutionary polyploidy extremely commonplace with few
