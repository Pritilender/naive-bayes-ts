spermatozoa from ancient greek seed and ancient greek living motile sperm cell moving form the haploid cell that the male gamete spermatozoon joins ovum form zygote zygote single with complete set chromosomes that normally develops into embryo sperm cells contribute approximately half the nuclear genetic information the diploid offspring most mitochondrial dna the sex the offspring determined

survival likelihood reduced and may thereby decreasing the total sperm quality sperm cells come two female and male sperm cells that give rise female offspring after fertilization differ that they carry while sperm cells that give rise male offspring carry male sperm cells consists disc shaped head and tail the tail flagellates which propels the sperm cell about minute whipping elliptical semen has alkaline and they not reach full motility until they reach the vagina where the alkaline neutralized acidic vaginal this gradual process takes minutes this fibrinogen from the seminal vesicles forms securing and protecting the just they become fibrinolysin from the prostate dissolves the allowing the sperm progress the spermatozoon characterized minimum cytoplasm and the most densely packed dna known eukaryotes compared mitotic chromosomes somatic cells sperm dna least sixfold more highly the specimen contributes with dna chromatin centriole and perhaps also oocyte activating factor may also contribute with paternal messenger rna also contributing embryonic electron micrograph human spermatozoa magnified times sperm cells the urine sample year old male patient who being followed with the diagnosis benign prostate another image from the same urine sample with the image the the human spermatozoon contains over different proteins avoidance immune system response glycoprotein molecules the surface ejaculated sperm cells are recognized all human female immune and interpreted signal that the cell should not the female immune system might otherwise attack sperm the reproductive tract the specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells are also utilized some cancerous and bacterial some parasitic and infected white blood thereby avoiding immune response from the host organism the blood testis barrier maintained the tight junctions between the sertoli cells the seminiferous prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa the testis and the blood vessels and immune cells circulating within within the interstitial space this prevents them from eliciting immune the testis barrier also important preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatozoa other organisms sperm female sperm storage animals fertilization relies spermatozoa for most sexually reproductive some species fruit fly produce the largest known spermatozoon found drosophila melanogaster produces sperm that can while its relative drosophila bifurca produce the largest known measuring over melanogaster the entire tail gets incorporated into the oocyte cytoplasm however for bifurca only small portion the tail enters the the wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus possesses spermatozoa with falciform what makes these gametocytes even more unique the presence apical hook the sperm this hook used attach the hooks the flagella other aggregation caused these attachments and mobile trains these trains provide improved motility the female reproductive tract and are means which fertilization sea urchins such arbacia punctulata are ideal organisms use sperm they spawn large numbers sperm into the making them suited model organisms for plants algae and fungi the gametophytes bryophytes ferns and some gymnosperms produce motile sperm cells contrary pollen grains employed most gymnosperms and all angiosperms this renders sexual reproduction the absence water impossible since water necessary medium for sperm and egg algae and lower plant sperm cells are often flagellated see and thus morphologically different from animal some algae and fungi produce motile sperm called higher plants and some algae and fertilization involves the migration the sperm nucleus through fertilization tube pollen tube higher reach the egg spermatozoa production mammals spermatogenesis spermatozoa are produced the seminiferous tubules the testes process called round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually become during copulation the cloaca vagina gets inseminated and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis the ovum inside fallopian tube the uterus spermatozoa activation acrosome reaction sea urchin approaching the egg cell rather multistep process chemotaxis guided different chemical stimuli individual levels one the most common signaling characters the event that prototype professional chemotaxis formyl peptide receptor receptor well the activator ability its ligand formyl phe have been demonstrated the surface membrane even the case human mammalian sperm cells become even more active when they approach egg cell process called sperm activation sperm activation has been shown caused calcium ionophores vitro progesterone released nearby cumulus cells and binding the zona pellucida the cumulus cells are embedded like substance made primarily hyaluronic and developed the ovary with the egg and support the initial change called hyperactivation which causes change spermatozoa they swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and recent discovery links hyperactivation sudden influx calcium ion into the the like tail the sperm studded with ion channels formed proteins called catsper these channels are allowing only calcium ion the opening catsper channels responsible for the influx the sudden rise calcium levels causes the flagellum form deeper propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous sperm hyperactivity necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from the second process sperm activation the acrosome reaction this involves releasing the contents the which and the exposure enzymes attached the inner acrosomal membrane the this occurs after the sperm first meets the this key type mechanism specific and prevents the sperm and egg different species from there some evidence that this binding what triggers the acrosome release the enzymes that allow the sperm fuse with the one the proteins that make the zona then binds partner molecule the enzymes the inner acrosomal membrane digests the zona after the sperm penetrates the zona part the cell membrane then fuses with the egg and the contents the head diffuse into the upon the oocyte said have become activated undergoes its secondary meiotic and the two haploid nuclei paternal and fuse form zygote order prevent polyspermy and minimise the possibility producing triploid zygote several changes the zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the artificial storage spermatozoa can stored diluents such has the illini variable temperature diluent which have been reported able preserve high fertility spermatozoa for over seven the ivt diluent composed several sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with semen cryopreservation can used for far longer storage
