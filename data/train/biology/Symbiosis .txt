biology	symbiosis navigation search symbology symbiosis symbiote clownfish sea anemone symbiosis from ancient greek together and living close and often term interaction between two more different biological species albert bernhard frank used the word symbiosis which previously had been used depict people living together describe the mutualistic relationship lichens the german mycologist heinrich anton bary defined the living together unlike the definition symbiosis controversial among some believe symbiosis should only refer persistent while others believe should apply any types persistent biological interactions mutualistic commensalistic parasitic after years current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter definition even broader definition symbiosis all species with absence the restrictive definition symbiosis mutualism some symbiotic relationships are obligate meaning that both symbionts entirely depend each other for for many lichens consist fungal and photosynthetic symbionts that cannot live their others are meaning that they but not have live with the other symbiotic relationships include those associations which one organism lives another ectosymbiosis such mistletoe where one partner lives inside the other endosymbiosis such lactobacilli and other bacteria humans symbiodinium corals symbiosis also classified physical attachment the symbiosis which the organisms have bodily union called conjunctive and symbiosis which they are not union called disjunctive contents physical interaction mutualism mutualism and endosymbiosis commensalism parasitism amensalism synnecrosis symbiosis and evolution vascular plants symbiogenesis evolution see also references bibliography external links physical interaction endosymbiosis any symbiotic relationship which one symbiont lives within the tissues the either within the cells examples include diverse microbiomes rhizobia nitrogen fixing bacteria that live root nodules legume roots actinomycete nitrogen fixing bacteria called frankia which live alder tree root single celled algae inside building corals and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients about ectosymbiosis also referred exosymbiosis any symbiotic relationship which the symbiont lives the body surface the including the inner surface the digestive tract the ducts exocrine glands examples this include ectoparasites such lice commensal ectosymbionts such the barnacles that attach themselves the jaw baleen whales and mutualist ectosymbionts such cleaner fish mutualism mutualism hermit crab calcinus laevimanus mutualism any relationship between individuals different species where both individuals only lifelong interactions involving close physical and biochemical contact can properly considered mutualistic relationships may either obligate for both obligate for one but facultative for the facultative for many biologists restrict the definition symbiosis close mutualist hermit crab bryozoans banc arguin mauritania large percentage herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant which more difficult digest than animal this gut flora made digesting protozoans bacteria living the intestines coral reefs are the result mutualisms between coral organisms and various types algae that live inside most land plants and land ecosystems rely mutualisms between the which fix carbon from the and mycorrhyzal fungi which help extracting water and minerals from the example mutual symbiosis the relationship between the ocellaris clownfish that dwell among the tentacles ritteri sea anemones the territorial fish protects the anemone from eating fish and turn the stinging tentacles the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators special mucus the clownfish protects from the stinging further example the goby fish which sometimes lives together with shrimp the shrimp digs and cleans burrow the sand which both the shrimp and the goby fish the shrimp almost leaving vulnerable predators when outside its case danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail warn when that happens both the shrimp and goby fish quickly retreat into the different species gobies elacatinus spp also exhibit mutualistic behavior through cleaning ectoparasites other another obligate symbiosis known from encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs that live close the bryozoan colony acanthodesia commensale develops cirumrotatory growth and offers the crab pseudopagurus granulimanus tubular extension its living chamber that initially was situated within gastropod one the most spectacular examples obligate mutualism between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live hydrothermal vents and cold seeps the worm has digestive tract and wholly reliant its internal symbionts for the bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide which the host supplies these worms were discovered the late the hydrothermal vents near the galapagos islands and have since been found deep sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps all the there are also many types tropical and tropical ants that have evolved very complex relationships with certain tree mutualism and endosymbiosis during mutualistic the host cell lacks some the which are provided the endosymbiont the host favors growth processes within itself producing some specialized these cells affect the genetic composition the host order regulate the increasing population the endosymbionts and ensuring that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission heredity adaptation the endosymbiont the lifestyle leads many changes the the foremost being drastic reduction its genome size this due many genes being lost during the process metabolism and dna repair and while important genes participating the dna rna transcription protein translation and rna replication are that decrease genome size due loss protein coding genes and not due lessening genic regions open reading frame size thus species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes genes can accounted for increased number noticeable differences between thereby leading changes their evolutionary the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed the offspring strictly via vertical genetic intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the resulting the decrease effective population sizes when compared the free living this incapability the endosymbiotic bacteria reinstate its wild type phenotype via recombination process called muller ratchet phenomenon muller ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led accretion deleterious mutations the essential genes the intracellular this could have been due lack selection mechanisms prevailing the rich environment the commensalism phoretic mites pseudolynchia canariensis commensalism commensalism describes relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other not significantly harmed derived from the english word commensal used human social interaction the word derives from the medieval latin formed from com and mensa meaning sharing commensal relationships may involve one organism using another for transportation phoresy for housing inquilinism may also involve one organism using something another after its death metabiosis examples metabiosis are hermit crabs using gastropod shells protect their bodies and spiders building their webs plants parasitism flea parasitism parasitic relationship one which one member the association benefits while the other this also known antagonistic antipathetic parasitic symbioses take many from endoparasites that live within the body ectoparasites that live its parasites may which say they kill their meaning they rely their biotrophic parasitism extremely successful mode depending the definition many half all animals have least one parasitic phase their life and also frequent plants and fungi moreover almost all living animals are host one more parasite taxa example biotrophic relationship would tick feeding the blood its amensalism biological interaction amensalism amensalism the type relationship that exists where one species inhibited completely obliterated and one this type symbiosis relatively uncommon rudimentary reference but omnipresent the natural citation needed example sapling growing under the shadow mature the mature tree can begin rob the sapling necessary sunlight the mature tree very can take rainwater and deplete soil throughout the process the mature tree indeed the sapling the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying note that these nutrients become available because the rather than from the living which would case citation needed synnecrosis synnecrosis rare type symbiosis which the interaction between species detrimental both organisms lived the interaction eventually causes because evolution selects against synnecrosis and uncommon the term rarely symbiosis and evolution leafhoppers meat ants while symbiosis has received less attention than other interactions such predation competition increasingly recognized important selective force behind with many species having long history interdependent evolution the evolution all eukaryotes animals fungi and protists believed under the endosymbiotic theory have resulted from symbiosis between various sorts this theory supported certain organelles dividing independently the and the observation that some organelles seem have their own nucleic vascular plants about vascular plants worldwide form symbiotic relationships with for arbuscular mycorrhizas symbiogenesis the biologist lynn margulis famous for her work endosymbiosis contends that symbiosis major driving force behind evolution she considers darwin notion driven incomplete and claims that evolution strongly based operation interaction and mutual dependence among according margulis and dorion sagan life did not take over the globe combat but networking evolution symbiosis played major role the evolution flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them many plants that are pollinated insects bats birds have highly specialized flowers modified promote pollination specific pollinator that also correspondingly the first flowering plants the fossil record had relatively simple adaptive speciation quickly gave rise many diverse groups and the same corresponding speciation occurred certain insect some groups plants developed nectar and large sticky while insects evolved more specialized morphologies access and collect these rich food some taxa plants and insects the relationship has become where the plant species can only pollinated one species see
