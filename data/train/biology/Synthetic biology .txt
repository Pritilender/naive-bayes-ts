march the neutrality this article disputed relevant discussion may found the talk page please not remove this message until the dispute resolved june synthetic biology the design and construction biological devices and systems for useful area biological research and technology that combines biology and engineering thus often overlapping with bioengineering and biomedical engineering encompasses variety different methodologies and disciplines with focus engineering biology and biotechnology synthetic biologists approach the creation new biological systems from different focusing finding how life works the origin how use benefit the former focus includes the approach inserting made dna into living cell and working gene synthesis extension synthetic chemistry the latter focus includes building the new biological system platform for various and rebuilding the natural systems provide the engineered the advance synthetic biology relies several key enabling technologies provided ever increasing speed and lower dna fabrication genes modeling how synthetic genes and precisely measuring gene behavior are essential tools synthetic its popularity has grown result increasing developments within dna synthesis now more affordable synthesize gene opposed cloning also genome databases can used template for creating viruses minimal geneticists have found number gene sequences which correspond differing traits these individual gene sequences have been developed and incorporated into dna similar genetic lego blocks this essentially how genetic engineers alter the dna living what separates synthetic biology from genetic engineering that rather than altering already existent dna synthetic biology puts these blocks together from scratch build entirely new strand dna which then placed into empty living these new cells can built perform number functions that could greatly benefit these operations not exist furthermore projects involving the integration standardized parts are the only ones that should deemed true synthetic biology synthetic biology introduces three new foundational technologies genetic the ability synthesize new genes novo the ability obscure complexity through and the introduction engineering biosafety and biosecurity concerns are the understandable response this new science and technology that have the potential profoundly change the nature life forms know numbers civic society groups and online forums called for study societal and ethical impact this new licensing and the community synthetic biology has discussed policy options and started initiatives symposia and meetings the broader science community have brought the efforts developing guidelines and addressing the issues intellectual property and and the societal and legal several bioethics research institutes published reports ethical concerns and the public perception synthetic report from the presidential commission for the study bioethical

synthetic biology safety and security social and ethical see also references external links history the term synthetic has history spanning the twentieth the first use was phane leducs publication orie chimique vie rations and biologie who said the polish geneticist wac szybalski used the term synthetic writing let now comment the question what now are working the descriptive phase molecular but the real challenge will start when enter the synthetic phase research our will then devise new control elements and add these new modules the existing genomes build wholly new this would field with unlimited expansion potential and hardly any limitations building new better control finally other synthetic organisms like new better not concerned that will run out exciting and novel the synthetic when the nobel prize physiology medicine was awarded arber nathans and smith for the discovery restriction enzymes wac szybalski wrote editorial comment the journal gene the work restriction nucleases not only permits easily construct recombinant dna molecules and analyze individual but also has led into the new era synthetic biology where not only existing genes are described and analyzed but also new gene arrangements can constructed and perspectives biology biologists are interested learning more about how natural living systems one direct way test current understanding natural living system build instance the system accordance with our current understanding the michael early work the repressilator one good example such elowitz had model for how gene expression should work inside living test his built piece dna accordance with his placed the dna inside living and watched what slight differences between observation and expectation highlight new science that may well worth work this sort often makes good use mathematics predict and study the dynamics the biological system before experimentally constructing wide variety mathematical descriptions have been used with varying including graph theory boolean networks ordinary differential equations stochastic differential equations and master equations order increasing chemistry biological systems are physical systems that are made around the turn the the science chemistry went through transition from studying natural chemicals trying design and build new this transition led the field synthetic chemistry the same some aspects synthetic biology can viewed extension and application synthetic chemistry and include work ranging from the creation useful new biochemicals studying the origins citation needed engineering engineers view biology technology the systems biotechnology systems biological engineering citation needed synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion with the ultimate goals being able design and build engineered biological systems that process manipulate fabricate materials and produce provide and maintain and enhance human health see biomedical engineering and our good example these technologies include the work chris voigt who redesigned the type iii secretion system used salmonella typhimurium secrete spider silk strong elastic instead its own natural infectious one aspect synthetic biology which distinguishes from conventional genetic engineering heavy emphasis developing foundational technologies that make the engineering biology easier and more good examples engineering synthetic biology include the pioneering work tim gardner and jim collins engineered genetic toggle riboregulator the registry standard biological parts and the international genetically engineered machine competition studies synthetic biology can subdivided into broad classifications according the approach they take the problem photocell biomolecular genome and the photocell approach includes projects make replicating systems from entirely synthetic biomolecular engineering includes approaches which aim create toolkit functional units that can introduced present new orthogonal functions living genetic engineering includes approaches construct synthetic chromosomes for whole minimal biomolecular design approach refers the general idea the novo design and combination biomolecular the task each these approaches create more synthetic entry higher level complexity manipulating part the proceeding writing writers are synthetic biologists who are interested testing the idea that since natural biological systems are would better off building the natural systems that care from the ground order provide engineered surrogates that are easier understand and interact writers draw inspiration from refactoring process sometimes used improve computer oligonucleotides harvested from photolithographic inkjet manufactured dna chip combined with dna mismatch correction allows inexpensive scale changes codons genetic systems improve gene expression incorporate novel acids see george church and anthony forster synthetic cell projects this favors scratch key enabling technologies this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and june there are several key enabling technologies that are critical the growth synthetic the key concepts include standardization biological parts and hierarchical abstraction permit using those parts increasingly complex synthetic achieving this greatly aided basic technologies reading and writing dna sequencing and which are improving performance exponentially kurzweil measurements under variety conditions are needed for accurate modeling and design dna sequencing dna sequencing determining the order the nucleotide bases molecule dna synthetic biologists make use dna sequencing their work several first large scale genome sequencing efforts continue provide wealth information naturally occurring this information provides rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and second synthetic biologists use sequencing verify that they fabricated their engineered system third fast cheap and reliable sequencing can also facilitate rapid detection and identification synthetic systems and cloning molecular cloning method used frequently geneticists obtain large quantities particular strand dna involves manipulating the particular piece dna and inserting into the circular plasmid dna bacterium once the foreign dna the bacterium allowed resume cellular function and replicate all the dna that the bacteria are cultured until the number clones the clones foreign dna are excised from the this sense the bacteria function cyborgs because foreign element introduced and interacts with the synthesis critical limitation synthetic biology today the time and effort expended during fabrication engineered genetic speed the cycle fabrication testing and synthetic biology requires more rapid and reliable novo dna synthesis and assembly fragments process commonly referred gene synthesis was reported that several companies were offering the synthesis genetic sequences for price about per base pair and turnaround time less than two september the price had dropped less than per base pair with some improvement turn around not only the price judged lower than the cost conventional cdna the economics make practical for researchers design and purchase multiple variants the same sequence identify genes proteins with optimized modeling models inform the design engineered biological systems allowing synthetic biologists better predict system behavior prior synthetic biology will benefit from better models how biological molecules bind substrates and catalyze how dna encodes the information needed specify the cell and how component integrated systems recently multiscale models gene regulatory networks have been developed that focus synthetic biology simulations have been used that model all biomolecular interactions translation regulation and induction gene regulatory guiding the design synthetic measurement precise and accurate quantitative measurements biological systems are crucial improving understanding such measurements often help elucidate how biological systems work and provide the basis for model construction and differences between predicted and measured system behavior can identify gaps understanding and explain why synthetic systems always behave technologies which allow many parallel and dependent measurements will especially useful synthetic citation needed microscopy and flow cytometry are examples useful measurement examples synthetic dna artificial gene synthesis expanded genetic code nucleic acid analogue synthetic genomics researchers washington reported synthesis the kbp kilo base hepatitis virus genome from chemically synthesized researchers suny stony brook succeeded synthesizing the base poliovirus genome from its published producing the second synthetic this took about two years painstaking the genome the bacteriophage phi was assembled about two the same the craig venter institute had constructed and patented synthetic genome novel minimal mycoplasma laboratorium and were working getting functioning living may researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial nucleotides into bacterial and including individual artificial nucleotides the culture were able passage the bacteria times they did not create mrna proteins able use the artificial base pair unnatural base pair synthetic cells the neutrality this section disputed relevant discussion may found the talk page please not remove this message until the dispute resolved june one important topic synthetic biology synthetic life that artificial life created vitro from biochemicals and their component synthetic life experiments attempt either probe the origins study some the properties more ambitiously recreate life from alive abiotic substances may craig venter group announced they had been able assemble complete genome millions base insert into and cause that cell start for the creation this synthetic cell first the complete dna sequence the genome bacterium mycoplasma mycoides was new genome was then designed based this genome with watermarks and elements necessary for growth yeast and genome transplantation well part its sequence deliberately this new genome was synthesized small over thousand overlapping cassettes synthetic oligonucleotides were which were then assembled steps yeast and other and the complete genome finally transplanted into cell from another species mycoplasma capricolum from which all genetic material had been the cell divided and was entirely controlled new ultimately demonstrating that dna can very practically described its chemical this cell has been referred venter the first synthetic and was created cost over million there some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can considered completely synthetic the grounds the chemically synthesized genome was almost copy naturally occurring genome the recipient cell was naturally occurring the craig venter institute maintains the term synthetic bacterial but they also clarify not consider this creating life from but rather are creating new life out already existing life using synthetic venter plans patent his experimental stating that they are pretty clearly human its creators suggests that building synthetic would allow researchers learn about life building rather than tearing they also propose stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap yield truly programmable researchers involved stated that the creation true synthetic biochemical relatively close reach with current technology and cheap compared the effort needed place man the genome editing numerous methods have been proposed for enabling the insertion sequences into precise locations well known examples include zinc finger nucleases talens and crispr systems the sleeping beauty transposon system example engineered enzyme for inserting precise dna sequences into genomes vertebrate the transposon synthetic sequence that was created based deriving consensus sequence extinct type transposons that are found evolutionary relics the genomes not vertebrates this enzyme took about year engineer and since its creation has been used for gene gene and gene therapy applications synthetic circuits vast number synthetic biological circuits have been and the number has been increasing steadily over the last years this refers creating system where some gene interest can expressed under prescribed the lac operon natural example that often hence this circuit follows simple the presence lactose several genes involved the metabolism lactose are reduced acid libraries many researchers have investigated the structure and function proteins reducing the normal set amino acids that generating proteins where certain groups amino acids may substituted with single amino for several non polar amino acids within protein may all replaced with single polar amino one project demonstrated that engineered version chorismate mutase still had catalytic activity when only amino acids were designed proteins while there are methods engineer natural proteins such directed evolution there are also projects design novel protein structures that match improve the functionality existing one group generated helix bundle that was capable binding oxygen with similar properties hemoglobin yet did not bind carbon monoxide similar protein structure was generated support variety oxidoreductase activities another group generated family protein coupled receptors which could activated the inert small molecule oxide but insensitive

aliivibrio fischeri the lux operon consists five genes which are necessary and sufficient for bacterial bioluminescence and can placed under alternate promoter express the genes response arbitrary environmental one such sensor created oak ridge national laboratory and named critter used coating bioluminescent bacteria light sensitive computer chip detect certain petroleum pollutants when the bacteria sense the they begin generate biosensors have been created detect viruses bacteria hormones drugs and dna citation needed other desirable targets for sensors include toxins persistent organic pollutants endocrine disruptors and warfare agents even more recently chemists the university nebraska created humidity gauge using gold plated bacteria silicon chip with decrease humidity there was increase the circuit one unique feature that separates the chip from the bioluminescent ones that after has been assimilated the bacteria longer needs kept alive for the humidity gauge nanotechnology also has made advances using researchers the cole polytechnique canada have attached microscopic bead swimming using magnetic resonance imaging machine the researchers have been able use the magnetic properties the bacteria direct certain the bead has purpose the moment but researchers hope store drugs other viral fighting agents inside that may released the directed information storage scientists can encode vast amounts digital information onto single strand synthetic dna george church encoded one his books about synthetic biology the data from the book more than times greater than the previous largest amount information stored synthesized similar project had encoded the complete sonnets william shakespeare challenges opposition synthetic biology opposition civil society groups
