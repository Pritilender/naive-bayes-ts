references external links and sources virus structure and classification major branch virology virus classification viruses can classified according the host cell they animal plant viruses fungal viruses and bacteriophages viruses infecting bacteria which include the most complex another classification uses the geometrical shape their capsid often helix icosahedron the structure presence absence lipid envelope viruses range size from about about which means that most them cannot seen with light microscopes the shape and structure viruses has been studied electron microscopy nmr spectroscopy and ray crystallography the most useful and most widely used classification system distinguishes viruses according the type nucleic acid they use genetic material and the viral replication method they employ coax host cells into producing more dna viruses divided into double stranded dna viruses and single stranded dna viruses rna viruses divided into positive sense stranded rna viruses negative sense stranded rna viruses and the much less common double stranded rna viruses reverse transcribing viruses double stranded transcribing dna viruses and single stranded transcribing rna viruses including retroviruses the latest report the international committee taxonomy viruses lists viruses organized over species genera families and orders virologists also study subviral particles infectious entities notably smaller and simpler than viroids naked circular rna molecules infecting satellites nucleic acid molecules with without capsid that require helper virus for infection and and prions proteins that can exist pathological conformation that induces other prion molecules assume that same taxa virology are not necessarily monophyletic the evolutionary relationships the various virus groups remain three hypotheses regarding their origin viruses arose from living separately from yet parallel perhaps the form replicating rna ribozymes similar viroids viruses arose genome reduction from more competent cellular life forms that became parasites host cells and subsequently lost most their examples such tiny parasitic prokaryotes are mycoplasma and nanoarchaea viruses arose from mobile genetic elements cells such transposons retrotransposons plasmids that became encapsulated protein acquired the ability break from the host cell and infect other particular interest here mimivirus giant virus that infects amoebae and encodes much the molecular machinery traditionally associated with simplified version parasitic did originate simpler virus that acquired genes from its the evolution which often occurs concert with the evolution their studied the field viral evolution while viruses reproduce and they not engage metabolism not and depend host cell for the debated question whether they are alive not matter definition that does not affect the biological reality viral diseases and host defenses one main motivation for the study viruses the fact that they cause many important infectious among them the common cold influenza rabies measles many forms diarrhea hepatitis dengue fever yellow fever polio smallpox and aids herpes simplex causes cold sores and genital herpes and under investigation possible factor alzheimer some known oncoviruses contribute the development certain forms cancer the best studied example the association between human papillomavirus and cervical cancer almost all cases cervical cancer are caused certain strains this sexually transmitted another example the association infection with hepatitis and hepatitis viruses and liver cancer some subviral particles also cause the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which include kuru creutzfeldt jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow are caused hepatitis due satellite virus the study the manner which viruses cause disease viral pathogenesis the degree which virus causes disease its virulence when the immune system vertebrate encounters may produce specific antibodies which bind the virus and neutralize its infectivity mark for destruction antibody presence blood serum often used determine whether person has been exposed given virus the with tests such elisa vaccinations protect against viral eliciting the production monoclonal antibodies specific the are also used for fluorescence microscopy second defense vertebrates against cell mediated immunity involves immune cells known cells the cells constantly display short fragments their proteins the and cell recognizes suspicious viral fragment the host cell destroyed and the specific cells this mechanism started certain rna interference important cellular mechanism found animals and many other eukaryotes most likely evolved defense against elaborate machinery interacting enzymes detects stranded rna molecules which occur part the life cycle many and then proceeds destroy all stranded versions those detected rna every lethal viral disease presents killing its host obviously benefit the how and why did evolve today believed that most viruses are relatively benign their natural some viral infection might even beneficial the the lethal viral diseases are believed have resulted from accidental jump the virus from species which benign new one that not accustomed see zoonosis for viruses that cause serious influenza humans probably have pigs birds their natural and hiv thought derive from the benign human primate virus siv while has been possible prevent viral diseases vaccination for long the development antiviral drugs treat viral diseases comparatively recent the first such drug was interferon substance that naturally produced when infection detected and stimulates other parts the immune molecular biology research and viral therapy bacteriophages the viruses which infect bacteria can relatively easily grown viral plaques bacterial cultures bacteriophages occasionally move genetic material from one bacterial cell another process known transduction and this horizontal gene transfer one reason why they served major research tool the early development molecular biology the genetic code the function ribozymes the first recombinant dna and early genetic libraries were all arrived using certain genetic elements derived from such highly effective promoters are commonly used molecular biology research growing animal viruses outside the living host animal more classically fertilized chicken eggs have often been but cell cultures are increasingly employed for this purpose since some viruses that infect eukaryotes need transport their genetic material into the host nucleus they are attractive tools for introducing new genes into the host known transformation transfection modified retroviruses are often used for this they integrate their genes into the chromosomes this approach using viruses gene vectors being pursued the gene therapy genetic obvious problem overcome viral gene therapy the rejection the transforming virus the immune phage therapy the use bacteriophages combat bacterial was popular research topic before the advent antibiotics and has recently seen renewed oncolytic viruses are viruses that preferably infect cancer cells while early efforts employ these viruses the therapy cancer there have been reports and encouraging preliminary other uses viruses new application genetically engineered viruses nanotechnology was recently see the uses viruses material science and nanotechnology for use mapping neurons see the applications pseudorabies neuroscience history virology history virology the word virus appeared and originally meant venom very early form vaccination known variolation was developed several thousand years ago involved the application materials from smallpox sufferers order immunize lady mary wortley montagu observed the practice istanbul and attempted popularize but encountered considerable edward jenner developed much safer using cowpox successfully immunize young boy against and this practice was widely vaccinations against other viral diseases including the successful rabies vaccination louis pasteur the nature viruses however was not clear these martinus beijerinck dimitri ivanovski showed that disease tobacco plants tobacco mosaic disease could transmitted extracts that were passed through filters fine enough exclude even the smallest known martinus beijerinck repeated work but went further and passed the filterable from plant found the action and concluded replicating the and thus not mere toxin called contagium vivum fluidum the question whether the agent was living particle was however still was suggested for the first time that transduction viruses might cause bang and ellerman showed that filterable virus could transmit chicken leukemia data largely ignored till the when leukemia became regarded peyton rous reported the transmission chicken sarcoma solid with and thus rous became father tumor the virus was later called rous sarcoma virus and understood retrovirus several other causing retroviruses have since been the existence viruses that infect bacteria was first recognized frederick twort and independently felix herelle bacteria could grown easily this led explosion virology the cause the devastating spanish flu pandemic was initially late french scientists showed that passing could transmit the disease people and fulfilling koch postulates was shown that scarlet fever caused bacterium that infected certain while plant viruses and bacteriophages can grown comparatively animal viruses normally require living host which complicates their study was shown that influenza virus could grown fertilized chicken method that still used today produce max theiler managed grow the yellow fever virus chicken eggs and produced vaccine from attenuated virus this vaccine saved millions lives and still being used max important investigator the area described the basic life virus rather than growing virus particle assembled from its constituent pieces one eventually leaves the host cell infect other the hershey chase experiment showed that only dna and not protein enters bacterial cell upon infection with bacteriophage transduction bacteria bacteriophages was first described the same john enders thomas weller and frederick robbins reported growth poliovirus cultured human embryonal cells the first significant example animal virus grown outside animals chicken this work aided jonas salk deriving polio vaccine from deactivated polio this vaccine was shown effective the first virus that could crystalized and whose structure could therefore elucidated detail was tobacco mosaic virus the virus that had been studied earlier ivanovski and wendell stanley achieved its crystallization for electron microscopy and showed that remains active even after clear ray diffraction pictures the crystallized virus were obtained bernal and fankuchen based such rosalind franklin proposed the full structure the tobacco mosaic virus also heinz conrat and robley williams showed that purified tmv rna and its capsid protein can assemble into functional suggesting that this assembly mechanism also used within the host had proposed the hepatitis virus was discovered baruch blumberg who went develop hepatitis howard temin described the first retrovirus virus whose rna genome was reverse transcribed into complementary dna then integrated into the genome and expressed from that the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase which along with integrase distinguishing trait was first described independently howard temin and david baltimore the first retrovirus infecting humans was identified robert gallo later was found that reverse transcriptase not specific retrotransposons which code for reverse transcriptase are abundant the genomes all about the human genome derives from such the functioning oncoviruses was clarified until that was thought that these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which when inserted into the would cause michael bishop and harold varmus showed that the oncogene rous sarcoma virus fact not specific the virus but contained the genome healthy animals many the oncovirus can switch this existing benign oncogene turning into true oncogene that causes saw the first recorded outbreak ebola hemorrhagic fever highly lethal virally transmitted frederick sanger achieved the first complete sequencing the genome any the bacteriophage phi the same richard roberts and phillip sharp independently showed that the genes adenovirus contain introns and therefore require gene splicing was later realized that almost all genes eukaryotes have introns worldwide vaccination campaign led the world health organization resulted the eradication smallpox stanley prusiner discovered prions and showed that they cause scrapie the first cases aids were reported and hiv the retrovirus causing was identified luc montagnier fran oise sinoussi and robert gallo tests detecting hiv infection detecting the presence hiv antibody were subsequent tremendous research efforts turned hiv into the best studied human herpes virus the cause kaposi sarcoma which often seen aids was identified several antiretroviral drugs were developed the late decreasing aids mortality dramatically developed the hepatitis virus was identified using novel molecular cloning techniques leading screening tests that dramatically reduced the incidence transfusion hepatitis the first attempts gene therapy involving viral vectors began the early when retroviruses were developed that could insert foreign gene into the they contained the foreign gene but did not contain the viral genome and therefore could not tests mice were followed tests humans beginning the first human studies attempted correct the genetic disease severe combined immunodeficiency but clinical success was the period from gene therapy was tried several other diseases and with different viral but became clear that the initially high expectations were further setback occurred when old jesse gelsinger died gene therapy suffered severe immune response after having received adenovirus vector success the gene therapy two cases linked scid was reported was reported that poliovirus had been synthetically assembled the representing the first synthetic assembling the base genome from starting with the published rna took about two faster method was shown assemble the base genome the bacteriophage phi weeks the giant mimivirus some sense intermediate between tiny prokaryotes and ordinary was described and sequenced the strain influenza virus subtype that killed million people during the spanish flu pandemic was reconstructed sequence information was pieced together from preserved tissue samples flu viable virus was then synthesized from this the flu pandemic involved another strain influenza commonly known swine harald zur hausen had shown that two strains human papillomavirus cause most cases cervical cancer two vaccines protecting against these strains were released and was reported that introducing small number specific transcription factor genes into normal skin cells mice humans can turn these cells into pluripotent stem cells known induced pluripotent stem cells the technique uses modified retroviruses transform the this potential problem for human therapy since these viruses integrate their genes random location the which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes sputnik virophage was the first known virophage uses the machinery helper virus reproduce and inhibits reproduction that helper sputnik reproduces amoeba infected mamavirus relative the mimivirus mentioned above and the largest known virus see also viruses portal introduction viruses virus
