viruses virus small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells other viruses can infect all types life from animals and plants bacteria and archaea since dmitri ivanovsky article describing bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco and the discovery the tobacco mosaic virus martinus beijerinck about viruses have been described although there are millions different viruses are found almost every ecosystem earth and are the most abundant type biological the study viruses known virology speciality microbiology virus particles known virions consist two three the genetic material made from either dna rna long molecules that carry genetic protein coat that protects these and some cases envelope lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside the shapes viruses range from simple helical and icosahedral forms more complex the average virus about one hundredth the size the average most viruses are too small seen directly with optical microscope the origins viruses the evolutionary history life are some may have evolved from plasmids pieces dna that can move between while others may have evolved from viruses are important means horizontal gene transfer which increases genetic diversity viruses are considered some life because they carry genetic reproduce and evolve through natural however they lack key characteristics such cell that are generally considered necessary count because they possess some but not all such viruses have been described organisms the edge viruses spread many viruses plants are often transmitted from plant plant insects that feed plant sap such aphids viruses animals can carried blood sucking insects these bearing organisms are known vectors influenza viruses are spread coughing and norovirus and rotavirus common causes viral gastroenteritis are transmitted the faecal oral route and are passed from person person entering the body food hiv one several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and exposure infected the range host cells that virus can infect called its host range this can narrow when virus capable infecting many broad viral infections animals provoke immune response that usually eliminates the infecting immune responses can also produced vaccines which confer artificially acquired immunity the specific viral however some viruses including those that cause aids and viral

referring poison and other noxious first used english virulent from latin virulentus dates meaning agent that causes infectious first recorded before the discovery viruses dmitri ivanovsky the english plural viruses whereas the latin word mass which has classically attested the adjective viral dates the term virion plural virions which dates from also used refer stable infective viral particle that released from the cell and fully capable infecting other cells the same history history virology social history viruses martinus beijerinck louis pasteur was unable find causative agent for rabies and speculated about pathogen too small detected using the french microbiologist charles chamberland invented filter known today the chamberland filter pasteur with pores smaller than thus could pass solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the the russian biologist dmitri ivanovsky used this filter study what now known the tobacco mosaic virus his experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after ivanovsky suggested the infection might caused toxin produced but did not pursue the the time was thought that all infectious agents could retained filters and grown nutrient this was part the germ theory disease the dutch microbiologist martinus beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained new form infectious observed that the agent multiplied only cells that were but his experiments did not show that was made called contagium vivum fluidum soluble living and introduced the word virus beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid theory later discredited wendell stanley who proved they were the same year friedrich loeffler and paul frosch passed the first animal agent foot mouth disease aphthovirus through similar the early the english bacteriologist frederick twort discovered group viruses that infect now called bacteriophages commonly phages and the canadian microbiologist lix herelle described viruses when added bacteria agar would produce areas dead accurately diluted suspension these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions lowest virus rather than killing all the formed discrete areas dead counting these areas and multiplying the dilution factor allowed him calculate the number viruses the original phages were heralded potential treatment for diseases such typhoid and cholera but their promise was forgotten with the development penicillin the study phages provided insights into the switching and off and useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into the end the viruses were defined terms their infectivity their ability and their requirement for living viruses had been grown only plants and ross granville harrison invented method for growing tissue lymph and steinhardt israeli and lambert used this method grow vaccinia virus fragments guinea pig corneal maitland and maitland grew vaccinia virus suspensions minced kidneys their method was not widely adopted until the when poliovirus was grown large scale for vaccine another breakthrough came when the american pathologist ernest william goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses fertilized eggs john franklin enders thomas weller and frederick robbins grew polio virus cultured human embryo the first virus grown without using solid animal tissue this work enabled jonas salk make effective polio vaccine the first images viruses were obtained upon the invention electron microscopy the german engineers ernst ruska and max knoll american biochemist and virologist wendell meredith stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found was mostly made short time this virus was separated into protein and rna the tobacco mosaic virus was the first crystallised and its structure could therefore elucidated the first ray diffraction pictures the crystallised virus were obtained bernal and fankuchen the basis her rosalind franklin discovered the full structure the virus the same heinz conrat and robley williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus rna and its protein coat can assemble themselves form functional suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host the second half the century was the golden age virus discovery and most the over recognised species plant and bacterial viruses were discovered during these equine arterivirus and the cause bovine virus diarrhea pestivirus were the hepatitis virus was discovered baruch blumberg and howard temin described the first retrovirus reverse transcriptase the enzyme that retroviruses use make dna copies their was first described independently howard martin temin and david baltimore luc montagnier team the pasteur institute france first isolated the retrovirus now called origins viruses are found wherever there life and have probably existed since living cells first the origin viruses unclear because they not form molecular techniques have been used compare the dna rna viruses and are useful means investigating how they there are three main hypotheses that try explain the origins parasitised rickettsia chlamydia degeneracy hypothesis reduction hypothesis plasmids between transposons within mobile genetic elements barbara mcclintock vagrancy hypothesis escape hypothesis virus first hypothesis nucleic acid viroids hepatitis delta virus genome sputnik virophage mimivirus acanthamoeba castellanii satellites the there were problems with all these the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest cellular parasites not resemble viruses any the escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures virus the first hypothesis contravened the definition viruses that they require host viruses are now recognised ancient and having origins that date the divergence life into the three domains this discovery has led modern virologists reconsider and evaluate these three classical the evidence for ancestral world rna cells and computer analysis viral and host dna sequences are giving better understanding the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors modern such analyses have not proved which these hypotheses however seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have common and viruses have probably arisen numerous times the past one more prions are infectious protein molecules that not contain dna they can cause infections such scrapie bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad disease and chronic wasting disease prionic diseases include kuru creutzfeldt jakob disease and gerstmann scheinker syndrome although prions are fundamentally different from viruses and their discovery gives credence the theory that viruses could have evolved from replicating microbiology life properties opinions differ whether viruses are form life organic structures that interact with living they have been described organisms the edge since they resemble organisms that they possess genes and evolve natural and reproduce creating multiple copies themselves through although they have they not have cellular which often seen the basic unit viruses not have their own metabolism and require host cell make new they therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside host cell although bacterial species such rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same accepted forms life use cell division whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within they differ from autonomous growth crystals they inherit genetic mutations while being subject natural virus assembly within host cells has implications for the study the origin life lends further credence the hypothesis that life could have started assembling organic structure capsid cowpea mosaic virus viruses display wide diversity shapes and called morphologies viruses are much smaller than most viruses that have been studied have diameter between and nanometres some filoviruses have total length their diameters are only about most viruses cannot seen with optical microscope scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used visualise increase the contrast between viruses and the electron dense stains are these are solutions salts heavy such tungsten that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the when virions are coated with stain positive fine detail negative staining overcomes this problem staining the background complete virus known consists nucleic acid surrounded protective coat protein called capsid these are formed from identical protein subunits called capsomeres viruses can have lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane the capsid made from proteins encoded the viral genome and its shape serves the basis for morphological virally coded protein subunits will assemble form general requiring the presence the virus complex viruses code for proteins that assist the construction their proteins associated with nucleic acid are known nucleoproteins and the association viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid called the capsid and entire virus structure can mechanically probed through atomic force microscopy there are four main morphological virus rna adenovirus herpes viruses icosahedron envelope cell membranes endoplasmic reticulum enterobacteria phage hexagonal the poxviruses are complex viruses that have unusual the viral genome associated with proteins within central disk structure known the nucleoid surrounded membrane and two lateral bodies unknown the virus has outer envelope with thick layer protein studded over its the whole virion slightly pleiomorphic ranging from ovoid brick mimivirus one the largest characterised with capsid diameter protein filaments measuring project from the the capsid appears hexagonal under electron therefore the capsid probably researchers discovered the largest known virus the ocean floor off the coast las cruces chile provisionally named megavirus chilensis can seen with basic optical the pandoravirus genus was discovered chile and and has genomes about twice large megavirus and some viruses that infect archaea have complex structures that are unrelated any other form with wide variety unusual ranging from shaped viruses that resemble hooked teardrops even other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed and can have multiple tail genome dna rna both dna and rna different stages the life linear circular segmented stranded stranded stranded with regions strandedness sense positive sense negative sense ambisense enormous variety genomic structures can seen among viral they contain more structural genomic diversity than animals archaea there are millions different types although only about them have been described virus has either dna rna genome and called dna virus rna respectively the vast majority viruses have rna plant viruses tend have stranded rna genomes and bacteriophages tend have stranded dna viral genomes are the polyomaviruses the adenoviruses the type nucleic acid irrelevant the shape the among rna viruses and certain dna the genome often divided into separate which case called segmented for rna each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together one however all segments are not required the same virion for the virus demonstrated brome mosaic virus and several other plant viral irrespective nucleic acid almost always either stranded single stranded genomes consist unpaired nucleic analogous half ladder split down the double stranded genomes consist two complementary paired nucleic analogous the virus particles some virus such those belonging the hepadnaviridae contain genome that partially stranded and partially for most viruses with rna genomes and some with stranded dna the single strands are said either positive sense called the negative sense called the depending whether not they are complementary the viral messenger rna positive sense viral rna the same sense viral mrna and thus least part can immediately translated the host negative sense viral rna complementary mrna and thus must converted sense rna rna dependent rna polymerase before dna nomenclature for viruses with sense genomic ssdna similar rna that the coding strand for the viral mrna complementary and the non coding strand copy however several types ssdna and ssrna viruses have genomes that are ambisense that transcription can occur off both strands stranded replicative examples include geminiviruses which are ssdna plant viruses and arenaviruses which are ssrna viruses genome size varies greatly between the smallest viral the ssdna family circoviridae code for only two proteins and have genome size only two the the pandoraviruses have genome sizes around two megabases which code for about proteins rna viruses have smaller genome sizes than dna viruses because higher rate when and have maximum upper size beyond this errors the genome when replicating render the virus useless compensate for rna viruses often have segmented the genome split into smaller thus reducing the chance that error component genome will incapacitate the entire dna viruses generally have larger genomes because the high fidelity their replication single strand dna viruses are exception this however mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme the ssrna virus human flu viruses undergo genetic change several these include process called antigenic drift where individual bases the dna rna mutate other most these point mutations are silent they not change the protein that the gene but others can confer evolutionary advantages such resistance antiviral drugs antigenic shift occurs when there major change the genome the this can result recombination reassortment when this happens with influenza pandemics might rna viruses often exist quasispecies swarms viruses the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside such quasispecies are prime target for natural segmented genomes confer evolutionary different strains virus with segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses that have unique this called reassortment viral sex genetic recombination the process which strand dna broken and then joined the end different dna this can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant the species recombination common both rna and dna replication cycle viral populations not grow through cell because they are instead they use the machinery and metabolism host cell produce multiple copies and they assemble the genomes the life cycle viruses differs greatly between species but there are six basic stages the life cycle attachment specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors the host cellular this specificity determines the host range for hiv infects limited range human leucocytes this because its surface specifically interacts with the molecule chemokine receptor which most commonly found the surface cells this mechanism has evolved favour those viruses that infect only cells which they are capable attachment the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein undergo changes that results the fusion viral and cellular changes enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus penetration follows virions enter the host cell through mediated endocytosis membrane fusion this often called viral entry the infection plant and fungal cells different from that animal plants have rigid cell wall made cellulose and fungi one most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma the cell however nearly all plant viruses such tobacco mosaic can also move directly from cell the form stranded nucleoprotein through pores called plasmodesmata bacteria like have strong cell walls that virus must breach infect the however given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due their much smaller some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell while the viral capsid remains uncoating process which the viral capsid this may degradation viral enzymes host enzymes simple the result the releasing the viral genomic nucleic replication viruses involves primarily multiplication the replication involves synthesis viral messenger rna from early genes with exceptions for positive sense rna viral protein synthesis possible assembly viral then viral genome replication mediated early regulatory protein this may for complex viruses with larger one more further rounds mrna late gene expression structural virion following the mediated assembly the virus some modification the proteins often viruses such this modification sometimes called occurs after the virus has been released from the host viruses can released from the host cell lysis process that kills the cell bursting its membrane and cell wall this feature many bacterial and some animal some viruses undergo lysogenic cycle where the viral genome incorporated genetic recombination into specific place the the viral genome then known provirus the case bacteriophages prophage whenever the host the viral genome also the viral genome mostly silent within the however some the provirus prophage may give rise active which may lyse the host enveloped viruses hiv typically are released from the host cell budding during this process the virus acquires its which modified piece the plasma internal the genetic material within virus and the method which the material varies considerably between different types dna viruses nucleus rna viruses cytoplasm polarity rna replicase reverse transcribing viruses retroviridae metaviridae pseudoviridae caulimoviridae hepadnaviridae reverse transcriptase retroviruses reverse transcription antiviral drugs zidovudine lamivudine hepadnaviridae effects the host cell the range structural and biochemical effects that viruses have the host cell these are called cytopathic effects most virus infections eventually result the death the host the causes death include cell alterations the surface membrane and apoptosis often cell death caused cessation its normal activities because suppression specific not all which are components the virus some viruses cause apparent changes the infected cells which the virus latent and inactive show few signs infection and often function this causes persistent infections and the virus often dormant for many months this often the case with herpes viruses some such epstein barr virus can cause cells proliferate without causing while such papillomaviruses are established causes host range viruses are far the most abundant biological entities earth and they outnumber all the others put they infect all types cellular life including plants bacteria and fungi however different types viruses can infect only limited range hosts and many are some such smallpox virus for can infect only one this case and are said have narrow host range other such rabies can infect different species mammals and are said have broad the viruses that infect plants are harmless and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless the host range some bacteriophages limited single strain bacteria and they can used trace the source outbreaks infections method called phage typing classification virus classification classification seeks describe the diversity viruses naming and grouping them the basis andr lwoff robert and paul tournier were the first develop means virus based the linnaean hierarchical this system bases classification phylum class order family genus and species viruses were grouped according their shared properties not those their and the type nucleic acid forming their later the international committee taxonomy viruses was however viruses are not classified the basis phylum their small genome size and high rate mutation makes difficult determine their ancestry beyond the baltimore classification used supplement the more traditional ictv classification the international committee taxonomy viruses developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that put greater weight certain virus properties maintain family unified taxonomy universal system for classifying has been the lctv report defines the concept the virus species the lowest taxon branching hierarchy viral however present only small part the total diversity viruses has been with analyses samples from humans finding that about the virus sequences recovered have not been seen and samples from the such from seawater and ocean finding that the large majority sequences are completely the general taxonomic structure order family subfamily genus virus species virus the current ictv six orders have been the herpesvirales mononegavirales nidovirales picornavirales and seventh order ligamenvirales has also been the committee does not formally distinguish between subspecies strains and isolates total there are orders families subfamilies genera about species and over types yet baltimore classification baltimore classification mrna the nobel prize winning biologist david baltimore devised the baltimore classification system the ictv classification system used conjunction with the baltimore classification system modern virus the baltimore classification viruses based the mechanism mrna production viruses must generate mrnas from their genomes produce proteins and replicate but different mechanisms are used achieve this each virus viral genomes may stranded stranded rna and may may not use reverse transcriptase ssrna viruses may either sense antisense this classification places viruses into seven dsdna viruses adenoviruses herpesviruses poxviruses ssdna viruses strand sense dna parvoviruses iii dsrna viruses reoviruses ssrna viruses strand rna picornaviruses togaviruses ssrna viruses strand rna orthomyxoviruses rhabdoviruses ssrna viruses strand rna with dna intermediate cycle retroviruses vii dsdna viruses hepadnaviruses example viral the chicken pox virus varicella zoster belongs the order family herpesviridae subfamily alphaherpesvirinae and genus varicellovirus vzv group the baltimore classification because dsdna virus that does not use reverse role human disease viral disease examples common human diseases caused viruses include the common cold influenza chickenpox and cold sores many serious diseases such ebola aids avian influenza and sars are caused the relative ability viruses cause disease described terms virulence other diseases are under investigation whether they too have virus the causative such the possible connection between human herpesvirus and neurological diseases such multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome there controversy over whether the bornavirus previously thought cause neurological diseases could responsible for psychiatric illnesses viruses have different mechanisms which they produce disease which depends largely the viral mechanisms the cellular level primarily include cell the breaking open and subsequent death the multicellular organisms enough cells the whole organism will start suffer the although viruses cause disruption healthy homeostasis resulting they may exist relatively harmlessly within example would include the ability the herpes simplex virus which causes cold remain dormant state within the human this called latency and characteristic the herpes including barr which causes glandular and varicella zoster which causes chickenpox and shingles most people have been infected with least one these types herpes however these latent viruses might sometimes the presence the virus can increase immunity against bacterial such yersinia pestis some viruses can cause lifelong chronic infections where the viruses continue replicate the body despite the defense this common hepatitis virus and hepatitis virus people chronically infected are known they serve reservoirs infectious populations with high proportion the disease said endemic epidemiology viral epidemiology the branch medical science that deals with the transmission and control virus infections transmission viruses can which means from mother which means from person examples vertical transmission include hepatitis virus and where the baby born already infected with the another more example the varicella zoster which although causing relatively mild infections can fatal the foetus and newborn horizontal transmission the most common mechanism spread viruses transmission can occur body fluids are exchanged during sexual hiv blood exchanged contaminated transfusion needle hepatitis exchange saliva epstein barr contaminated food water norovirus aerosols containing virions are influenza and insect vectors such mosquitoes penetrate the skin dengue the rate speed transmission viral infections depends factors that include population density the number susceptible those not the quality healthcare and the epidemiology used break the chain infection populations during outbreaks viral diseases control measures are used that are based knowledge how the virus important find the the outbreak and identify the once the virus has been the chain transmission can sometimes broken when vaccines are not sanitation and disinfection can often infected people are isolated from the rest the and those that have been exposed the virus are placed quarantine control the outbreak foot mouth disease cattle britain thousands cattle were most viral infections humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes signs incubation periods for viral diseases range from few days but are known for most somewhat but mainly following the incubation there period communicability time when infected individual animal contagious and can infect another person this too known for many viral and knowledge the length both periods important the control when outbreaks cause unusually high proportion cases community they are called epidemics outbreaks spread they are called pandemics epidemics and pandemics flu pandemic aids ebola virus disease list epidemics transmission electron microscope influenza native american populations were devastated contagious smallpox brought the americas european unclear how many native americans were killed foreign diseases after the arrival columbus the but the numbers have been estimated close the indigenous the damage done this disease significantly aided european attempts displace and conquer the native pandemic worldwide the flu pandemic which lasted until was category influenza pandemic caused unusually severe and deadly influenza the victims were often healthy young contrast most influenza which predominantly affect elderly weakened older estimates say killed million while more recent research suggests that may have killed many million the population most researchers believe that hiv originated sub saharan africa during the now pandemic with estimated million people now living with the disease the joint united nations programme aids and the world health organization estimate that aids has killed more than million people since was first recognised june making one the most destructive epidemics recorded there were million new hiv infections and million related marburg virus several highly lethal viral pathogens are members the filoviridae filoviruses are like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever and include the ebola and marburg viruses the marburg virus attracted widespread press attention april for outbreak angola beginning october and continuing into the outbreak was the worst epidemic any kind viral hemorrhagic cancer oncovirus viruses are established cause cancer humans and other viral cancers occur only minority infected persons cancer viruses come from range virus including both rna and dna and there single type oncovirus obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming the development cancer determined variety factors such host immunity and mutations the viruses accepted cause human cancers include some genotypes human papillomavirus hepatitis virus hepatitis virus epstein barr virus kaposi associated herpesvirus and human lymphotropic virus the most recently discovered human cancer virus polyomavirus merkel cell polyomavirus that causes most cases rare form skin cancer called merkel cell carcinoma hepatitis viruses can develop into chronic viral infection that leads liver cancer infection human lymphotropic virus can lead tropical spastic paraparesis and adult cell leukemia human papillomaviruses are established cause cancers cervix skin anus and penis within the herpesviridae kaposi associated herpesvirus causes kaposi sarcoma and body cavity and barr virus causes burkitt lymphoma hodgkin lymphoma lymphoproliferative disorder and nasopharyngeal carcinoma merkel cell polyomavirus closely related and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used animal models for cancer viruses for over years host defence mechanisms immune system the first line defence against viruses the innate immune system this comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection specific this means that the cells the innate system and respond pathogens generic but unlike the adaptive immune system does not confer lasting protective immunity the rna interference important innate defence against many viruses have replication strategy that involves stranded rna when such virus infects releases its rna molecule which immediately bind protein complex called dicer that cuts the rna into smaller biochemical pathway the risc complex which ensures cell survival degrading the viral rotaviruses have evolved avoid this defence mechanism not uncoating fully inside the and releasing newly produced mrna through pores the inner their genomic dsrna remains protected inside the core the when the adaptive immune system vertebrate encounters produces specific antibodies that bind the virus and often render this called humoral immunity two types antibodies are the called igm highly effective neutralizing viruses but produced the cells the immune system only for few the called igg produced the presence igm the blood the host used test for acute whereas igg indicates infection sometime the igg antibody measured when tests for immunity are carried antibodies can continue effective defence mechanism even after viruses have managed gain entry the host protein that called trim can attach the antibodies the surface the virus this primes the subsequent destruction the virus the enzymes the proteosome system rotaviruses second defence vertebrates against viruses called cell mediated immunity and involves immune cells known the cells constantly display short fragments their proteins the and cell recognises suspicious viral fragment the host cell destroyed killer cells and the specific cells cells such the macrophage are specialists this antigen presentation the production interferon important host defence this hormone produced the body when viruses are its role immunity eventually stops the viruses from reproducing killing the infected cell and its close not all virus infections produce protective immune response this hiv evades the immune system constantly changing the amino acid sequence the proteins the surface the this known escape the viral epitopes escape recognition the host immune these persistent viruses evade immune control blockade antigen presentation cytokine resistance evasion natural killer cell activities escape from apoptosis and antigenic shift other called neurotropic viruses are disseminated neural spread where the immune system may unable reach prevention and treatment because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells they are difficult eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects host cells the most effective medical approaches viral diseases are vaccinations provide immunity and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral vaccines vaccination vaccination cheap and effective way preventing infections vaccines were used prevent viral infections long before the discovery the actual their use has resulted dramatic decline morbidity and mortality associated with viral infections such polio measles mumps and rubella smallpox infections have been vaccines are available prevent over thirteen viral infections and more are used prevent viral infections vaccines can consist attenuated killed viral proteins antigens live vaccines contain weakened forms the which not cause the disease nonetheless confer such viruses are called live vaccines can dangerous when given people with weak who are described immunocompromised because these the weakened virus can cause the original biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used produce subunit these vaccines use only the capsid proteins the hepatitis vaccine example this type subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the the yellow fever virus attenuated strain called probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever antiviral drugs antiviral drug guanosine aciclovir antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues fake dna which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during the cycle the virus then halted because the newly synthesised dna this because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups which along with phosphorus atoms link together form the strong backbone the dna this called dna chain termination examples nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes simplex virus infections and lamivudine for hiv and hepatitis virus aciclovir one the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral other antiviral drugs use target different stages the viral life hiv dependent proteolytic enzyme called the hiv protease for become fully there large class drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this hepatitis caused rna people the disease and without they are infected for the remainder their however there now effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon the treatment chronic carriers the hepatitis virus using similar strategy using lamivudine has been infection other species viruses infect all cellular life although viruses occur each cellular species has its own specific range that often infect only that some called satellites can replicate only within cells that have already been infected another animal viruses animal virus veterinary virology viruses are important pathogens diseases such mouth disease and bluetongue are caused companion animals such dogs and not are susceptible serious viral canine parvovirus caused small dna virus and infections are often fatal like all invertebrates the honey bee susceptible many viral however most viruses exist harmlessly their host and cause signs symptoms plant viruses plant virus peppers there are many types plant but often they cause only loss yield and not economically viable try control plant viruses are often spread from plant plant organisms known vectors these are normally but some fungi nematode worms and single celled organisms have been shown when control plant virus infections considered for perennial for efforts are concentrated killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only living plant plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against one the most effective the presence called resistance genes each gene confers resistance particular virus triggering localised areas cell death around the infected which can often seen with the unaided eye large this stops the infection from rna interference also effective defence when they are plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill such salicylic acid nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules plant virus particles like particles have applications both biotechnology and nanotechnology the capsids most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can produced large quantities either the infection plants expression variety heterologous plant virus particles can modified genetically and chemically encapsulate foreign material and can incorporated into supramolecular structures for use bacterial viruses bacteriophage bacteriophages are common and diverse group viruses and are the most abundant form biological entity aquatic there are ten times more these viruses the oceans than there are reaching levels bacteriophages per millilitre these viruses infect specific bacteria binding surface receptor molecules and then entering the within short amount some cases just bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mrna into these proteins become either new virions within the helper which help assembly new proteins involved cell viral enzymes aid the breakdown the cell and the case the phage just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could the major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages producing enzymes that destroy foreign these called restriction endonucleases cut the viral dna that bacteriophages inject into bacterial bacteria also contain system that uses crispr sequences retain fragments the genomes viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with the which allows them block the replication through form rna interference this genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity archaean viruses some viruses replicate within archaea these are stranded dna viruses with unusual and sometimes unique these viruses have been studied most detail the thermophilic particularly the orders sulfolobales and thermoproteales defences against these viruses may involve rna interference from repetitive dna sequences within archaean genomes that are related the genes the role aquatic ecosystems marine bacteriophage teaspoon seawater contains about one million most these are which are harmless plants and and are fact essential the regulation saltwater and freshwater they infect and destroy bacteria aquatic microbial and are the most important mechanism recycling carbon the marine the organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal microorganisms constitute more than the biomass the estimated that viruses kill approximately this biomass each day and that there are times many viruses the oceans there are bacteria and viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction harmful algal blooms which often kill other marine the number viruses the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the where there are fewer host the effects marine viruses are increasing the amount photosynthesis the viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount carbon dioxide the atmosphere approximately gigatonnes carbon per like any marine mammals are susceptible viral and thousands harbor seals were killed europe phocine distemper virus many other including caliciviruses herpesviruses adenoviruses and parvoviruses circulate marine mammal role evolution horizontal gene transfer viruses are important natural means transferring genes between different which increases genetic diversity and drives thought that viruses played central role the early before the diversification archaea and the time the last universal common ancestor life viruses are still one the largest reservoirs unexplored genetic diversity applications life sciences and medicine viruses are important the study molecular and cell biology they provide simple systems that can used manipulate and investigate the functions the study and use viruses have provided valuable information about aspects cell for viruses have been useful the study genetics and helped our understanding the basic mechanisms molecular genetics such dna replication transcription rna processing translation protein transport and immunology geneticists often use viruses vectors introduce genes into cells that they are this useful for making the cell produce foreign study the effect introducing new gene into the similar virotherapy uses viruses vectors treat various they can specifically target cells and shows promising use the treatment cancer and gene therapy eastern european scientists have used phage therapy alternative antibiotics for some and interest this approach because the high level antibiotic resistance now found some pathogenic expression heterologous proteins viruses the basis several manufacturing processes that are currently being used for the production various proteins such vaccine antigens and industrial processes have been recently developed using viral vectors and number pharmaceutical proteins are currently clinical and clinical materials science and nanotechnology current trends nanotechnology promise make much more versatile use from the viewpoint materials viruses can regarded organic their surface carries specific tools designed cross the barriers their host the size and shape and the number and nature the functional groups their precisely viruses are commonly used materials science scaffolds for covalently linked surface particular quality viruses that they can tailored directed the powerful techniques developed life sciences are becoming the basis engineering approaches towards opening wide range applications far beyond biology and because their shape and defined chemical viruses have been used templates for organizing materials the recent examples include work the naval research laboratory washington using cowpea mosaic virus cpmv particles amplify signals dna microarray based this the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling prevent the formation fluorescent dimers that act quenchers another example the use cpmv nanoscale breadboard for molecular synthetic viruses many viruses can synthesized novo from and the first synthetic virus was created although somewhat not the actual virus that but rather its dna genome case dna cdna copy its genome case rna for many virus families the naked synthetic dna rna once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic infectious when introduced into that they contain all the necessary information produce new this technology now being used investigate novel vaccine the ability synthesize viruses has reaching since viruses can longer regarded long the information their genome sequence known and permissive cells are march the length genome sequences different including are publicly available online database maintained the national institutes health weapons biological warfare the ability viruses cause devastating epidemics human societies has led the concern that viruses could weaponised for biological further concern was raised the successful recreation the infamous influenza virus the smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its there are only two centers the world that are authorized the who keep stocks smallpox the vector institute russia and the centers for disease control and prevention the united states however fears that may used weapon may not totally the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe longer used routinely any thus much the modern human population has almost established resistance and would vulnerable the see also viruses portal disease
