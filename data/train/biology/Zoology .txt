relates the animal including the embryology evolution classification habits and distribution all animals both living and extinct the term derived from ancient greek animal and logos study contents history ancient history darwin post darwin research structural physiological evolutionary systematics ethology biogeography branches zoology see also references external links history history zoology through ancient history darwin conrad gesner historiae animalium the history zoology traces the study the animal kingdom from ancient modern times although the concept zoology single coherent field arose much the zoological sciences emerged from natural history reaching back the works aristotle and galen the ancient greco roman world this ancient work was further developed the middle ages muslim physicians and scholars such albertus magnus during the renaissance and early modern zoological thought was revolutionized europe renewed interest empiricism and the discovery many novel prominent this movement were vesalius and william harvey who used experimentation and careful observation and naturalists such carl linnaeus and buffon who began classify the diversity life and the fossil record well the development and behavior microscopy revealed the previously unknown world laying the groundwork for cell theory the growing importance natural theology partly response the rise mechanical philosophy encouraged the growth natural history although entrenched the argument from design over the and zoology became increasingly professional scientific discipline explorer naturalists such alexander von humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their and the ways this relationship depends laying the foundations for biogeography ecology and ethology naturalists began reject essentialism and consider the importance extinction and the mutability species cell theory provided new perspective the fundamental basis post darwin history zoology since these well the results from embryology and paleontology were synthesized charles darwin theory evolution natural selection darwin placed the theory organic evolution new his discovery process which organic evolution can and provided observational evidence that had done darwin gave new direction morphology and physiology uniting them common biological the theory organic the result was reconstruction the classification animals upon genealogical basis fresh investigation the development and early attempts determine their genetic the end the century saw the fall spontaneous generation and the rise the germ theory disease though the mechanism inheritance remained the early the rediscovery mendel work led the rapid development genetics thomas hunt morgan and his and the the combination population genetics and natural selection the neo darwinian synthesis research structural cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties cells including their behavior interactions and environment this done both the microscopic and molecular levels for celled organisms such bacteria well the specialized cells multicellular organisms such humans understanding the structure and function cells fundamental all the biological the similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant molecular anatomy considers the forms macroscopic structures such organs and organ focuses how organs and organ systems work together the bodies humans and addition how they work anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely and can categorized under structural studies physiological handbuch der anatomie der tiere nstler physiology studies the physical and biochemical processes living organisms attempting understand how all the structures function the theme structure central physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology but some principles physiology are matter what particular organism being for what learned about the physiology yeast cells can also apply human the field animal physiology extends the tools and methods human physiology human physiology studies how for example nervous immune endocrine respiratory and circulatory systems function and evolutionary evolutionary research concerned with the origin and descent species well their change over and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented for generally involves scientists who have special training particular organisms such mammalogy ornithology herpetology but use those organisms systems answer general questions about evolutionary biology partly based paleontology which uses the fossil record answer questions about the mode and tempo and partly the developments areas such population genetics and evolutionary the developmental biology entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study evolutionary developmental biology related fields often considered part evolutionary biology are phylogenetics systematics and taxonomy systematics scientific classification zoology method which zoologists group and categorize organisms biological type such genus species biological classification form scientific taxonomy modern biological classification has its root the work carolus linnaeus who grouped species according shared physical these groupings have since been revised improve consistency with the darwinian principle common descent molecular phylogenetics which uses dna sequences has driven many recent revisions and likely continue biological classification belongs the science zoological systematics systema naturae many scientists now consider the five kingdom system outdated modern alternative classification systems generally start with the three domain system archaea originally bacteria originally eukaryota including protists fungi plants and animals these domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei well differences the chemical composition the cell further each kingdom broken down recursively until each species separately the order domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species the scientific name organism generated from its genus and for humans are listed homo sapiens homo the and sapiens the specific both them combined make the species when writing the scientific name proper capitalize the first letter the genus and put all the specific epithet additionally the entire term may italicized the dominant classification system called the linnaean taxonomy includes ranks and binomial nomenclature the taxonomy and nomenclature zoological organisms administered the international code zoological nomenclature and international code nomenclature bacteria for animals and respectively the classification viruses viroids prions and all other viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics conducted the international code virus classification and nomenclature however several other viral classification systems merging biocode was published attempt standardize nomenclature these but has yet formally the biocode draft has received little attention since its originally planned implementation date january has passed however paper concerning the cyanobacteria does advocate future adoption biocode and interim steps consisting reducing the differences between the the international code virus classification and nomenclature remains outside the ethology kelp gull ethology the scientific and objective study animal behavior under natural opposed behaviourism which focuses behavioral response studies laboratory setting ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution behavior and the understanding behavior terms the theory natural selection one the first modern ethologist was charles darwin whose the expression the emotions man and animals influenced many future biogeography biogeography studies the spatial distribution organisms the earth focusing topics like plate tectonics climate change dispersal and migration and cladistics the creation this study widely accredited alfred russel wallace british biologist who had some his work jointly published with charles darwin branches zoology although the study animal life its scientific incarnation relatively this mirrors the transition from natural history biology the start the nineteenth since hunter and cuvier comparative anatomical study has been associated with morphography shapins the modern areas zoological anatomy physiology histology embryology teratology and ethology modern zoology first arose german and british thomas henry huxley was prominent his ideas were centered the morphology many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist the latter half the nineteenth similar hunter his courses were composed lectures and laboratory practical classes contrast the previous format lectures gradually zoology expanded beyond comparative anatomy include the following zoography also known descriptive zoology describes animals and their habitats comparative anatomy studies the structure animal physiology behavioral ecology ethology studies animal invertebrate zoology vertebrate zoology comparative zoology the various taxonomically oriented disciplines such mammalogy herpetology ornithology and entomology identify and classify species and study
