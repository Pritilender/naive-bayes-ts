reaction that occurs between acid and base several concepts exist that provide alternative definitions for the reaction mechanisms involved and their application solving related despite several differences their importance becomes apparent different methods analysis when applied base reactions for gaseous liquid when acid base character may somewhat less the first these scientific concepts acids and bases was provided the french chemist antoine lavoisier circa contents common base theories arrhenius definition solvent system definition lowry definition lewis definition other base theories lux flood definition pearson definition usanovich definition acid alkali reaction historic base theories lavoisier oxygen theory acids liebig hydrogen theory acids see also references external links common base theories arrhenius definition the first modern definition acids and bases was devised svante arrhenius hydrogen theory followed from his work with friedrich wilhelm ostwald establishing the presence ions aqueous solution and led arrhenius receiving the nobel prize chemistry defined arrhenius acid substance that dissociates water form hydrogen ions that acid increases the concentration ions aqueous this causes the protonation the creation the hydronium ion thus modern the use regarded shorthand for because now known that bare proton does not exist free species aqueous arrhenius base substance that dissociates water form hydroxide ions that base increases the concentration ions aqueous the arrhenius definitions acidity and alkalinity are restricted aqueous and refer the concentration the solvent under this pure and hcl dissolved toluene are not and molten naoh and solutions calcium amide liquid ammonia are not overall qualify arrhenius upon the introduction the chemical must either directly increase the aqueous hydronium decrease the aqueous hydroxide conversely qualify arrhenius upon the introduction the chemical must either directly decrease the aqueous hydronium increase the aqueous hydroxide the universal aqueous base definition the arrhenius concept described the formation water molecule from proton and hydroxide this leads the definition that arrhenius base salt and water are formed from the reaction between acid and this neutralization reaction the acid and base properties and are for they combine form the water the base neutralization reaction can put into word the positive ion from base and the negative ion from acid form salt together other base neutralization reaction double replacement reaction for when neutralization reaction takes place between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide the products are sodium chloride common table and notice how the cations and the anions merely switched the from the naoh combined with the from the hcl form while the from the naoh combined with the from the hcl form solvent system definition one the limitations the arrhenius definition its reliance water edward franklin studied the base reactions liquid ammonia and pointed out the similarities the based arrhenius albert germann working with liquid cocl formulated the based theory thereby generalizing the arrhenius definition cover aprotic germann pointed out that many there are ions equilibrium with the neutral solvent solvonium generic name for positive solvate generic name for negative for water and ammonia undergo such dissociation into hydronium and hydroxide and ammonium and amide respectively some aprotic systems also undergo such such dinitrogen tetroxide into nitrosonium and nitrate antimony trichloride into dichloroantimonium and and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride sbcl sbcl sbcl cocl cocl solute that causes increase the concentration the solvonium ions and decrease the concentration solvate ions defined acid solute that causes increase the concentration the solvate ions and decrease the concentration the solvonium ions defined base thus liquid knh supplying strong and supplying strong liquid sulfur dioxide thionyl compounds supplying behave and sulfites supplying behave the aqueous base reactions liquid ammonia are similar the reactions nanh amphiphilic nitric acid can base liquid sulfuric hno hso the unique strength this definition shows describing the reactions aprotic for liquid agno nocl agcl because the solvent system definition depends the solute well the solvent particular solute can either acid base depending the choice the hclo strong acid weak acid acetic and weak base fluorosulfonic this characteristic the theory has been seen both strength and because some substances such and have been seen acidic basic their own the other solvent system theory has been criticized being too general also has been thought that there something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen property not shared hydrogenic solvonium lowry definition lowry base theory the lowry formulated independently johannes nicolaus nsted denmark and martin lowry based upon the idea protonation bases through the protonation acids that the ability acids donate hydrogen ions otherwise known protons which accept them important note that the theory does not refer the removal proton from the nucleus which would require levels energy not attainable through the simple dissociation but removal hydrogen ion base reaction thus the removal hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition the the removal hydrogen ion from acid produces its conjugate base which the acid with hydrogen ion the reception proton base produces its conjugate acid which the base with hydrogen ion unlike the previous the lowry definition does not refer the formation salt and but instead the formation conjugate acids and conjugate bases produced the transfer proton from the acid the this acids and bases are fundamentally different behavior from which are seen subject the theories debye onsager and acid and base react not produce salt and but form new acid and new the concept neutralization thus lowry base behavior formally independent any making more encompassing than the arrhenius the general formula for base reactions according the lowry definition where represents the represents the represents the conjugate acid and represents the conjugate base for lowry model for the dissociation hydrochloric acid aqueous solution would the the removal from the hcl produces the chloride ion the conjugate base the the addition the acting forms the hydronium ion the conjugate acid the water amphoteric that can act both acid and the lowry model explains showing the dissociation water into low concentrations hydronium and hydroxide ions this equation demonstrated the image here one molecule water acts donating and forming the conjugate and second molecule water acts accepting the ion and forming the conjugate example water acting consider aqueous solution ammonia ammonia acts accepting form the ammonium ion water acts donating form the hydroxide ion furthermore the lowry the solvent does not necessarily have for consider the reaction with acetic acid absence cooh coo the removal from acetic acid forms its conjugate the acetate ion coo the addition the the ammonia forms its conjugate the ammonium ion the lowry model calls containing substances like acids thus some which many chemists considered such bcl are excluded from this classification due lack gilbert lewis wrote restrict the group acids those substances that contain hydrogen interferes seriously with the systematic understanding chemistry would the restriction the term oxidizing agent substances containing oxygen furthermore koh and knh are not considered nsted but rather salts containing the bases and lewis definition lewis acids and bases the hydrogen requirement arrhenius and lowry was removed the lewis definition base devised gilbert lewis the same year but was not elaborated him until instead defining base reactions terms protons other bonded the lewis definition defines base referred lewis base compound that can donate electron pair and acid lewis acid compound that can receive this electron this acid does not exchange atoms with but combines with for consider this classical aqueous base hcl naoh nacl the lewis definition does not regard this reaction the formation salt and water the transfer from hcl instead regards the acid the ion and the base the ion which has unshared electron therefore the base reaction according the lewis the donation the electron pair from the ion this forms covalent bond between and thus producing water treating base reactions terms electron pairs instead specific the lewis definition can applied reactions that not fall under other definitions base for silver cation behaves acid with respect which behaves the following the result this reaction the formation silver adduct reactions between lewis acids and bases there the formation adduct when the highest occupied molecular orbital homo such with available lone electron donates lone pairs electrons the deficient lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo through ordinate covalent bond such the interacting molecule acts and the interacting molecule acts polar such boron trifluoride the most electronegative element pulls electrons towards its own providing more positive charge the electronegative element and difference its electronic structure due the axial equatorial orbiting positions its causing repulsive effects from lone pair bonding pair interactions between bonded atoms excess those already provided bonding pair bonding pair interactions adducts involving metal ions are referred ordination other base theories lux flood definition this base theory was revival oxygen theory acids and proposed german chemist hermann lux further improved kon flood circa and still used modern geochemistry and electrochemistry molten salts this definition describes acid oxide ion acceptor and base oxide ion for mgo mgco cao sio casio pearson definition hsab theory ralph pearson proposed advanced qualitative concept known hard soft acid base principle later made quantitative with help robert parr applies species that are have high charge and are weakly applies species that are have low charge states and are strongly acids and bases and the most stable interactions are hard and this theory has found use organic and inorganic usanovich definition mikhail usanovich developed general theory that does not restrict acidity containing but his published was even more general than lewis usanovich theory can summarized defining acid anything that accepts negative species donates positive and base the this defined the concept redox special case base reactions some examples usanovich base reactions sbs acid alkali reaction neutralization alkali reaction special case base where the base used also alkali when acid reacts with alkali forms metal salt and acid alkali reactions are also type neutralization reaction acid alkali reactions can simplified omitting spectator ions acids are general pure substances that contain hydrogen ions cause them produced hydrochloric acid hcl and sulfuric acid are common these break apart into hcl hso produce hydroxide ions the alkali breaks apart into ions naoh historic base theories lavoisier oxygen theory acids the first scientific concept acids and bases was provided lavoisier circa since knowledge strong acids was mainly restricted oxoacids such hno nitric and sulfuric which tend contain central atoms high oxidation states surrounded and since was not aware the true composition the hydrohalic acids hcl hbr and defined acids terms their containing oxygen which fact named from greek words meaning from the greek oxys meaning acid sharp and geinomai meaning engender the lavoisier definition was held absolute truth for over years until the article and subsequent lectures sir humphry davy which proved the lack oxygen and the hydrohalic acids however davy failed develop new concluding that acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary but upon peculiar arrangement various one notable modification oxygen theory was provided berzelius who stated that acids are oxides nonmetals while bases are oxides liebig hydrogen theory acids circa justus von liebig proposed that acid containing substance which the hydrogen could replaced this redefinition was based his extensive work the chemical composition organic acids finishing the doctrinal shift from based acids based acids started liebig while completely remained use for almost years until the adoption the arrhenius see also electron
