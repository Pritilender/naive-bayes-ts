chemistry	allotropy allotrope navigation search allotrophy diamond graphite allotropy allotropism from greek meaning other and meaning form the property some chemical elements exist two more different known allotropes these allotropes are different structural modifications the atoms the element are bonded together different for the allotropes carbon include diamond where the carbon atoms are bonded together tetrahedral lattice graphite where the carbon atoms are bonded together sheets hexagonal lattice graphene single sheets and fullerenes where the carbon atoms are bonded together tubular ellipsoidal the term allotropy used for elements not for compounds the more general used for any crystalline polymorphism allotropy refers only different forms element within the same phase different solid liquid gas forms these different states are themselves considered examples for some allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist different phases for two allotropes oxygen dioxygen and ozone can both exist the liquid and gaseous conversely some elements not maintain distinct allotropes different phases for example phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes which all revert the same form when melted the liquid contents history differences properties allotropes list allotropes non metals metalloids metals lanthanides and actinides see also notes references external links history the concept allotropy was originally proposed the swedish scientist baron jakob berzelius the term derived from the greek allotropia variability changeableness after the acceptance avogadro hypothesis was understood that elements could exist polyatomic and the two allotropes oxygen were recognized and the early century was recognized that other cases such carbon were due differences crystal ostwald noted that the allotropy elements just special case the phenomenon polymorphism known for and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy abandoned and replaced polymorph and although many other chemists have repeated this iupac and most chemistry texts still favour the usage allotrope and allotropy for elements differences properties allotropes allotropes are different structural forms the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical the change between allotropic forms triggered the same forces that affect other pressure light and temperature therefore the stability the particular allotropes depends particular for iron changes from body centered cubic structure face centered cubic structure austenite above and tin undergoes transformation known tin pest from metallic form semiconductor form below example allotropes having different chemical ozone much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen list allotropes this section requires expansion may typically elements capable variable coordination number and oxidation states tend exhibit greater numbers allotropic another contributing factor the ability element catenate examples allotropes non metals carbon diamond extremely transparent with the carbon atoms arranged tetrahedral poor electrical excellent thermal lonsdaleite also called hexagonal graphite black flaky moderate electrical the atoms are bonded flat hexagonal lattices graphene which are then layered linear acetylenic carbon amorphous carbon fullerenes including

and ytterbium have three praseodymium neodymium gadolinium and terbium have two plutonium has six distinct solid allotropes under normal pressures their densities vary within ratio some which vastly complicates all kinds work with the metal particularly machining and seventh plutonium allotrope exists very high the transuranium metals and are also promethium americium berkelium and californium
