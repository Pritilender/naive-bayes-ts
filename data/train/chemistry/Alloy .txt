alloy navigation search alloy steel iron carbon alloy mixture solid solution composed metal and another alloy contains one more the solid solution the elements single mixture metallic phases two more intermetallic compound with distinct boundary between the solid solution alloys give single solid phase microstructure while partial solutions exhibit two more phases that may may not homogeneous depending the thermal heat history the metallic compound has one other alloy pure metal embedded within another pure alloys are used some where their properties are superior those the pure component elements for given examples alloys are steel solder brass pewter phosphor bronze and amalgam the alloy constituents are usually measured alloys are usually classified substitutional interstitial depending the atomic arrangement that forms the they can further classified homogeneous consisting single heterogeneous consisting two more intermetallic where there distinct boundary between contents

precipitation hardening alloys see also references bibliography external links introduction alloy mixture either pure fairly pure chemical elements which forms impure substance that retains the characteristics metal alloy distinct from impure such wrought iron with the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful alloys are made mixing two more least one which being this usually called the primary metal the base and the name this metal may also the name the the other constituents may may not metals when mixed with the molten they will soluble dissolving into the when the alloy cools and solidifies crystallizes its mechanical properties will often quite different from those its individual metal that normally very soft and malleable such aluminium can altered alloying with another soft like copper although both metals are very soft and ductile the resulting aluminium alloy will much harder and stronger adding small amount metallic carbon iron produces alloy called steel due its high strength and toughness which much higher than pure and its ability greatly altered heat treatment steel one the most common alloys modern adding chromium its resistance corrosion can creating stainless steel while adding silicon will alter its electrical producing silicon steel although the elements usually must soluble the liquid state they may not always soluble the solid state the metals remain soluble when the alloy forms solid solution becoming homogeneous structure consisting identical called phase the mixture cools and the constituents become they may separate form two more different types creating heterogeneous microstructure different however other the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization these alloys are called intermetallic alloys cooled very they first crystallize homogeneous but they are supersaturated with the secondary time the atoms these supersaturated alloys separate within the forming intermetallic phases that serve reinforce the crystals some alloys occur such electrum which alloy that native consisting silver and gold meteorites are sometimes made occurring alloys iron and nickel but are not native the one the first alloys made humans was bronze which made mixing the metals tin and copper bronze was extremely useful alloy the because much stronger and harder than either its steel was another common however ancient could only created accidental byproduct from the heating iron ore fires smelting during the manufacture other ancient alloys include pewter brass and pig iron the modern steel can created many carbon steel can made varying only the carbon producing soft alloys like mild steel hard alloys like spring steel alloy steels can made adding other such molybdenum vanadium resulting alloys such high speed steel tool steel small amounts manganese are usually alloyed with most steels because its ability remove unwanted like phosphorus sulfur and oxygen which can have detrimental effects the however most alloys were not created until the such various titanium nickel and magnesium alloys some modern superalloys such incoloy inconel and hastelloy may consist multitude different terminology the term alloy used describe mixture atoms which the primary constituent the primary metal called the base the matrix the solvent the secondary constituents are often called solutes there mixture only two types not counting such copper nickel alloy then called binary there are three types atoms forming the such nickel and then called ternary alloy with four constituents quaternary while part alloy termed quinary because the percentage each constituent can with any mixture the entire range possible variations called system this all the various forms alloy containing only two like iron and called binary while all the alloy combinations possible with ternary such alloys carbon and called ternary system although alloy impure when referring the term impurities usually denotes those elements which are not these impurities are often found the base metals the but they may also introduced during the alloying for sulfur common impurity sulfur combines readily with iron form iron sulfide which very creating weak spots the lithium sodium and calcium are common impurities aluminium which can have adverse effects the structural integrity conversely otherwise metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called impure and are not usually referred oxygen present the readily combines with most metals form metal oxides especially higher temperatures encountered during great care often taken during the alloying process remove excess using fluxes chemical other methods extractive metallurgy some alloys are used predominantly with respect their base metals that the name the primary constituent also used the name the for karat gold alloy gold with other similarly the silver used jewelry and the aluminium used structural building material are also the term alloy sometimes used everyday speech synonym for particular for automobile wheels made aluminium alloy are commonly referred simply alloy although point fact steels and most other metals practical use are also theory alloying metal done combining with one more other metals metals that often enhance its for steel stronger than iron its primary the physical such density reactivity young modulus and electrical and thermal conductivity alloy may not differ greatly from those its but engineering properties such tensile strength and shear strength may substantially different from those the constituent this sometimes result the sizes the atoms the because larger atoms exert compressive force neighboring and smaller atoms exert tensile force their helping the alloy resist sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences behavior even when small amounts one element are for impurities semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead different first predicted hogan suhl tian abrie and some alloys are made melting and mixing two more bronze alloy copper and tin was the first alloy during the prehistoric period now known the bronze age was harder than pure copper and originally used make tools and but was later superseded metals and alloys with better later times bronze has been used for ornaments bells statues and bearings brass alloy made from copper and zinc unlike pure most alloys not have single melting point but melting range which the material mixture solid and liquid phases the temperature which melting begins called the solidus and the temperature when melting just complete called the liquidus however for most alloys there particular proportion constituents rare cases the eutectic mixture which gives the alloy unique melting heat treatable alloys pearlite cementite ferrite martensite alloys are often made alter the mechanical properties the base induce hardness toughness ductility other desired most metals and alloys can work hardened creating defects their crystal these defects are created during plastic deformation such hammering and are permanent unless the metal recrystallized however some alloys can also have their properties altered heat treatment nearly all metals can softened annealing which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the but not many can hardened controlled heating and many alloys aluminium copper magnesium titanium and nickel can strengthened some degree some method heat but few respond this the same degree that steel does certain usually between and the base metal steel undergoes change the arrangement the atoms its crystal called allotropy this allows the small carbon atoms enter the interstices the diffusing into the iron when this the carbon atoms are said solution mixed with the forming homogeneous crystalline phase called austenite the steel cooled the iron will gradually change into its low temperature when this happens the carbon atoms will longer soluble with the and will forced precipitate out nucleating into the spaces between the the steel then becomes being formed two the carbon carbide phase cementite and ferrite this type heat treatment produces steel that rather soft and however the steel cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time when rapidly diffusionless transformation occurs which the carbon atoms become trapped this causes the iron crystals deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries change its low temperature making very hard and conversely most treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys which produce the opposite effects that steel when heated form solution and then cooled these alloys become much softer than during the diffusionless and then harden they the solutes these alloys will precipitate over forming intermetallic phases which are difficult discern from the base unlike which the solid solution separates form different crystal precipitation hardening alloys separate form different phases within the same these intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous crystal but tend behave becoming hard and somewhat substitutional and interstitial alloys when molten metal mixed with another there are two mechanisms that can cause alloy called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism the relative size each element the mix plays primary role determining which mechanism will when the atoms are relatively similar the atom exchange method usually where some the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms the other this called substitutional alloy examples substitutional alloys include bronze and which some the copper atoms are substituted with either tin zinc with the interstitial one atom usually much smaller than the cannot successfully replace atom the crystals the base the smaller atoms become trapped the spaces between the atoms the crystal called the interstices this referred interstitial alloy steel example interstitial because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices the iron stainless steel example combination interstitial and substitutional because the carbon atoms fit into the but some the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium history meteoric iron meteoric iron the use alloys humans started with the use meteoric iron naturally occurring alloy nickel and iron metallurgic processes were used separate iron from the alloy was used meteoric iron could forged from red heat make objects such weapons and many cultures was shaped cold hammering into knives and they were often used meteoric iron was very rare and and difficult for ancient people bronze and brass iron usually found iron ore except for one deposit native iron greenland which was used the inuit people native copper however was found along with silver gold and platinum which were also used make jewelry and other objects since neolithic copper was the hardest these and the most widely became one the most important metals the eventually humans learned smelt metals such copper and tin from ore and around began alloying the two metals form bronze which much harder than its tin was however being found mostly great the middle people began alloying copper with zinc form brass ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties such hardness toughness and melting point under various conditions temperature and work hardening developing much the information contained modern alloy constitution diagrams amalgams mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands mercury dissolves many such silver and form amalgams alloy soft liquid form ambient amalgams have been used since china for plating objects with precious called gilding such armor and mirrors the ancient romans often used tin amalgams for gilding their the amalgam was applied paste and then heated until the mercury leaving the silver tin mercury was often used extract precious metals like gold and silver from their precious metal alloys many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic ancient egypt and mycenae gold was often alloyed with copper produce iron produce bright gold was often found alloyed with silver other metals produce various types colored gold these metals were also used strengthen each for more practical copper was often added silver make sterling silver increasing its strength for use silverware and other practical quite precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances means deceive around archimedes was commissioned the king find way check the purity the gold leading the famous house shouting upon the discovery archimedes principle pewter the term pewter covers variety alloys consisting primarily pure tin was much too soft used for any practical however the bronze age tin was rare metal many parts europe and the was often valued higher than make forks and other objects from was usually alloyed with other metals increase its strength and these metals were typically lead antimony bismuth these solutes sometimes were added individually varying added making wide variety ranging from practical like surgical candlesticks decorative items such ear rings and hair the earliest examples pewter come from ancient around the use pewter was widespread across from france norway and britain where most the ancient tin was the near the alloy was also used china and the far arriving japan around where was used for making objects like ceremonial tea chalices used shinto shrines steel and pig iron the first known smelting iron began anatolia around called the bloomery process produced very soft but ductile wrought iron and the technology had spread pig iron very hard but brittle alloy iron and carbon was being produced china early but did not arrive europe until the middle pig iron has lower melting point than and was used for making cast iron however these metals found little practical use until the introduction crucible steel around these steels were poor and the introduction pattern welding around the century sought balance the extreme properties the alloys laminating create tougher around the japanese began folding steel and iron alternating layers increase the strength their using clay fluxes remove slag and this method japanese swordsmithing produced one the purest alloys ancient while the use iron started become more widespread around mainly because interruptions the trade routes for the metal much softer than however very small amounts steel alloy iron and around carbon was always byproduct the bloomery the ability modify the hardness steel heat treatment had been known since and the rare material was valued for use tool and weapon because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough melt iron the production steel decent quantities did not occur until the introduction blister steel during the middle this method introduced carbon heating wrought iron charcoal for long periods but the penetration carbon was not very the alloy was not benjamin huntsman began melting blister steel crucible even out the carbon creating the first process for the mass production tool steel huntsman process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early with the introduction the blast furnace europe the middle pig iron was able produced much higher volumes than wrought because pig iron could people began develop processes reducing the carbon the liquid pig iron create puddling was introduced during the where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed the remove the carbon oxidation sir henry bessemer developed process making blowing hot air through liquid pig iron reduce the carbon the bessemer process was able produce the first large scale manufacture once the bessemer process began gain widespread other alloys steel began mangalloy alloy steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and was one the first alloy steels and was created robert hadfield precipitation hardening alloys precipitation hardening alloys were discovered alfred wilm precipitation hardening such certain alloys aluminium titanium and are treatable alloys that soften when quenched cooled and then harden over after quenching ternary alloy copper and magnesium wilm discovered that the alloy increased hardness when left age room although explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until duralumin was one the first age alloys and was soon followed many because they often exhibit combination high strength and low these alloys became widely used many forms including the construction modern aircraft see also calphad heat
