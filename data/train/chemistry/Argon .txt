further reading external links characteristics argon has approximately the same solubility water and times more soluble water than nitrogen argon odorless nonflammable and nontoxic liquid and argon chemically inert under most conditions and forms confirmed stable compounds room although argon noble gas has been found have the capability forming some for the creation argon fluorohydride marginally stable compound argon with fluorine and hydrogen was reported researchers the university helsinki although the neutral state chemical compounds argon are presently limited argon can form clathrates with water when atoms are trapped lattice the water argon containing ions and excited state complexes such arh and respectively are known theoretical calculations have predicted several argon compounds that should but for which synthesis routes are currently history lord rayleigh henry cavendish alkali grove cells ruhmkorff coil argon neuter singular form greek meaning inactive reference its chemical was suspected present air henry cavendish but was not isolated until lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay university college london experiment which they removed all the oxygen carbon dioxide water and nitrogen from sample clean they had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was half percent lighter than nitrogen from the the difference seemed but was important enough attract their attention for many they concluded that there was another gas the air mixed with the argon was also encountered through independent research newall and hartley each observed new lines the color spectrum air but were unable identify the element responsible for the argon became the first member the noble gases the symbol for argon now but until was occurrence argon constitutes volume and mass the earth atmosphere and air the primary raw material used industry produce purified argon argon isolated from air most commonly cryogenic fractional distillation process that also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton and xenon the crust and seawater contain ppm and ppm respectively isotopes isotopes argon the main isotopes argon found earth are and naturally occurring with half life years decays stable electron capture positron emission and also stable via beta decay these properties and ratios are used determine the age rocks the method dating the made cosmic ray activity primarily with the subsurface also produced through neutron capture alpha emission calcium created from the neutron spallation result subsurface nuclear explosions has life days argon notable that its isotopic composition varies greatly between different locations the solar system where the major source argon the decay will the dominant argon produced directly stellar nucleosynthesis dominated the alpha process nuclide correspondingly solar argon contains based solar wind measurements and the ratio the three isotopes the atmospheres the outer planets measured this contrasts with the abundance primordial only ppmv ppmv comparable that neon ppmv and with measurements interplanetary probes the martian atmosphere contains and ppm the mariner probe the planet mercury found that mercury has very thin atmosphere with argon believed result from releases the gas decay product from radioactive materials the the huygens probe discovered the presence exclusively titan the largest moon saturn the predominance radiogenic responsible for the standard atomic weight terrestrial argon being greater than that the next potassium which was puzzling the time when argon was mendeleev had placed the elements his periodic table order atomic but the inertness argon suggested placement before the reactive alkali metal henry moseley later solved this problem showing that the periodic table actually arranged order atomic number see history the periodic table compounds van der waals molecule filling model argon fluorohydride complete octet electrons indicates full and this full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant bonding with other before argon and the other noble gases were considered chemically inert and unable form however compounds the heavier noble gases have since been august the first argon compound was formed researchers the university helsinki shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing small amount hydrogen fluoride with caesium iodide argon fluorohydride was stable kelvin the metastable arcf dication which valence isoelectronic with carbonyl fluoride was observed argon the form argon hydride ions has been detected cosmic dust associated with the crab nebula supernova this was the first noble gas molecule detected outer space production industrial argon produced industrially the fractional distillation liquid air cryogenic air separation unit process that separates liquid nitrogen which boils from which boils and liquid oxygen which boils about tonnes argon are produced worldwide every radioactive decays the most abundant isotope produced the decay with life years electron capture positron emission because used potassium argon dating determine the age applications there are several different reasons argon used particular inert gas argon the cheapest alternative when nitrogen not sufficiently low thermal conductivity the electronic properties ionization the emission are other noble gases would probably work well most these but argon far the argon inexpensive since occurs naturally and readily obtained byproduct cryogenic air separation the production liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen the primary constituents air are used large industrial the other noble gases except helium are produced this way but argon the most plentiful the bulk argon applications arise simply because inert and relatively industrial processes argon used some temperature industrial where ordinarily reactive substances become for argon atmosphere used graphite electric furnaces prevent the graphite from for some these the presence nitrogen oxygen gases might cause defects within the argon used various types arc welding such gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding well the processing titanium and other reactive argon atmosphere also used for growing crystals silicon and germanium shielding gas argon used the poultry industry asphyxiate birds either for mass culling following disease means slaughter more humane than the electric argon relatively high density causes remain close the ground during its reactive nature makes suitable food and since replaces oxygen within the dead argon also enhances shelf citation needed argon sometimes used for extinguishing fires where damage equipment scientific research liquid argon used the target for neutrino experiments and direct dark matter searches the interaction hypothetical wimp particle with the argon nucleus produces scintillation light that detected photomultiplier tubes two phase detectors also use argon gas detect the ionized electrons produced during the nucleus with most other liquefied noble argon has high scintillation lightyield photons kev transparent its own scintillation and relatively easy compared xenon argon cheaper and has distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation electronic recoils from nuclear the other its intrinsic ray background larger due contamination unless one uses underground argon sources with low level clarification needed dark matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include ardm microclean and neutrino experiments include icarus and microboone both which use high purity liquid argon time projection chamber for fine grained dimensional imaging neutrino preservative caesium argon used displace and containing air packaging material extend the lives the contents argon has the european food additive code aerial hydrolysis and other chemical reactions which degrade the products are retarded prevented bottles purity chemicals and certain pharmaceutical products are available sealed bottles ampoules packed wine argon used off barrels avoid the aerial oxidation ethanol acetic acid during the aging argon also available aerosol type which may used preserve compounds such varnish polyurethane paint etc for storage after since the american national archives stores important national documents such the declaration independence and the constitution within filled cases retard their using argon reduces gas compared with the helium used the preceding five laboratory equipment gloveboxes oxygen nitrogen free technique argon may used the inert gas within schlenk lines and gloveboxes the use argon over comparatively less expensive nitrogen preferred where nitrogen may react with the experimental reagents argon may used the carrier gas gas chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry the gas choice for the plasma used icp spectroscopy argon preferred for the sputter coating specimens for scanning electron microscopy argon gas also commonly used for sputter deposition thin films microelectronics and for wafer cleaning microfabrication medical use cryosurgery procedures such cryoablation use liquefied argon destroy cancer surgery used procedure called argon enhanced which form argon plasma beam electrosurgery the procedure carries risk producing gas embolism the
