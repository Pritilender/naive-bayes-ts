chemistry	arrhenius equation navigation search equation simple but remarkably accurate formula for the temperature dependence reaction rates the equation was proposed svante arrhenius based the work dutch chemist jacobus henricus van hoff who had noted that van equation for the temperature dependence equilibrium constants suggests such formula for the rates both forward and reverse arrhenius provided physical justification and interpretation for the currently best seen empirical relationship can used model the temperature variation diffusion population crystal creep and many other induced the eyring equation developed also expresses the relationship between rate and historically useful generalization supported equation for many common chemical reactions room the reaction rate doubles for every degree celsius increase contents equation arrhenius plot modified equation theoretical interpretation the equation arrhenius concept activation energy collision theory transition state theory limitations the idea arrhenius activation energy see also references bibliography external links equation arrhenius equation gives the dependence the rate constant chemical reaction the absolute temperature kelvin where the pre exponential factor simply the prefactor the activation energy and the universal gas constant alternatively the equation may expressed the only difference the energy units the former form uses energy per mole which common while the latter form uses energy per molecule directly which common the different units are accounted for using either gas constant the boltzmann constant the multiplier temperature the units the exponential factor are identical those the rate constant and will vary depending the order the the reaction first order has the units and for that reason often called the frequency factor attempt frequency the most the number collisions that result reaction per the total number collisions leading reaction per second and the probability that any given collision will result can seen that either increasing the temperature decreasing the activation energy for example through the use catalysts will result increase rate given the small temperature range kinetic studies occur reasonable approximate the activation energy being independent the similarly under wide range practical the weak temperature dependence the exponential factor negligible compared the temperature dependence the factor except the case barrierless diffusion limited which case the exponential factor dominant and directly arrhenius plot arrhenius plot taking the natural logarithm equation this has the same form equation for straight when reaction has rate constant that obeys equation plot versus gives straight whose gradient and intercept can used determine and this procedure has become common experimental chemical kinetics that practitioners have taken using define the activation energy for that the activation energy defined times the slope plot modified equation the modified equation makes explicit the temperature dependence the exponential one allows arbitrary temperature dependence the the arrhenius description becomes and the inverse problem determining the prefactor and activation energy from experimental becomes the modified equation usually the form where reference temperature and allows unitless clearly the original arrhenius expression above corresponds fitted rate constants typically lie the range theoretical analyses yield various predictions for has been pointed out that not feasible the basis temperature studies the rate whether the predicted dependence the exponential factor observed however additional evidence from theory from experiment such density there obstacle incisive tests the arrhenius another common modification the stretched exponential form citation needed where unitless number order this typically regarded fudge factor make the model fit the but can have theoretical for example showing the presence range activation energies special cases like the mott variable range hopping theoretical interpretation the equation arrhenius concept activation energy arrhenius argued that for reactants transform into they must first acquire minimum amount called the activation energy absolute temperature the fraction molecules that have kinetic energy greater than can calculated from statistical mechanics the concept activation energy explains the exponential nature the and one way present all kinetic the calculations for reaction rate constants involve energy averaging over maxwell boltzmann distribution with lower bound and are often the type incomplete gamma functions which turn out proportional collision theory collision theory one example comes from the collision chemical developed max trautz and william lewis the years this molecules are supposed react they collide with relative kinetic energy along their center that exceeds this leads expression very similar the arrhenius transition state theory another like expression appears the transition state theory chemical formulated wigner eyring polanyi and evans the this takes various but one the most common where the gibbs free energy boltzmann constant and planck constant first sight this looks like exponential multiplied factor that linear however one must remember that free energy itself temperature dependent the free energy activation the difference enthalpy term and entropy term multiplied the absolute when all the details are worked out one ends with expression that again takes the form arrhenius exponential multiplied slowly varying function the precise form the temperature dependence depends upon the and can calculated using formulas from statistical mechanics involving the partition functions the reactants and the activated limitations the idea arrhenius activation energy both the arrhenius activation energy and the rate constant are experimentally and represent macroscopic specific parameters that are not simply related threshold energies and the success individual collisions the molecular consider particular collision elementary between molecules and the collision the relative translational the internal particularly energy will all determine the chance that the collision will produce product molecule macroscopic measurements and are the result many individual collisions with differing collision probe reaction rates molecular experiments are conducted under collisional conditions and this subject often called molecular reaction see also accelerated aging
