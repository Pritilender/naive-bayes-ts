the tastes changes the color indicators turns red litmus paper blue reacts with acids form and promotes certain chemical reactions base catalysis examples bases are the hydroxides the alkali and alkaline earth metals naoh etc such substances produce hydroxide ions aqueous and are thus classified arrhenius bases for substance classified arrhenius must produce hydroxide ions order arrhenius believed the base must contain hydroxide the this makes the arrhenius model cannot explain the basic properties aqueous solutions ammonia its organic derivatives amines the more general lowry base theory base substance that can accept hydrogen ions otherwise known protons the lewis model base electron pair donor altering the autoionization equilibrium bases give solutions with hydrogen ion activity lower than that pure higher than standard soluble base called alkali contains and releases ions quantitatively however important realize that basicity not the same alkalinity metal oxides hydroxides and especially alkoxides are and counteranions weak acids are weak bases can thought the chemical opposite acids bases and acids are seen opposites because the effect acid increase the hydronium concentration whereas bases reduce this reaction between acid and base called neutralization neutralization aqueous solution base reacts with aqueous solution acid produce solution water and salt which the salt separates into its component the aqueous solution saturated with given salt solute any additional such salt precipitates out the the notion base concept chemistry was first introduced the french chemist guillaume ois rouelle noted that which that time were mostly volatile liquids like acetic acid turned into solid salts only when combined with specific rouelle considered that such substance serves base for the giving the salt concrete solid contents properties neutralization acids alkalinity hydroxides strong bases superbases bases catalysts uses bases etymology the term see also further reading references properties some general properties bases include slimy soapy feel due saponification the lipids human concentrated strong bases are caustic organic matter and react violently with acidic aqueous solutions molten bases dissociate ions and conduct reactions with indicators bases turn red litmus paper phenolphthalein keep bromothymol blue its natural colour and turn methyl orange the level basic solution higher than bases are bitter neutralization acids when dissolved the strong base sodium hydroxide ionizes into hydroxide and sodium and water the acid hydrogen chloride forms hydronium and chloride when the two solutions are the and ions combine form water equal quantities naoh and hcl are the base and the acid neutralize leaving only effectively table salt weak such baking soda egg should used neutralize any acid neutralizing acid spills with strong such sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide can cause violent exothermic and the base itself can cause just much damage the original acid alkalinity hydroxides bases are generally compounds that can neutralize amount both sodium carbonate and ammonia are although neither these substances contains groups both compounds accept when dissolved protic solvents such from can calculated for aqueous solutions bases also directly act pair donors carbon can act base well nitrogen and oxygen this occurs typically compounds such butyl lithium alkoxides and metal amides such sodium amide bases nitrogen and oxygen without resonance stabilization are usually very superbases which cannot exist water solution due the acidity resonance however enables weaker bases such for sodium acetate weak base strong bases strong base basic chemical compound that can remove proton from deprotonate molecule very weak acid base common examples strong bases include hydroxides alkali metals and alkaline earth metals like naoh and very strong bases can even deprotonate very weakly acidic groups the absence here list several strong potassium hydroxide barium hydroxide cesium hydroxide sodium hydroxide strontium hydroxide calcium hydroxide lithium hydroxide rubidium hydroxide the cations these strong bases appear the first and second groups the periodic table alkali and earth alkali acids with more than about are considered very and their conjugate bases are strong superbases superbase group salts amides and hydrides tend even stronger bases due the extreme weakness their conjugate which are stable amines and usually these bases are created adding pure alkali metals such sodium into the conjugate they are called superbases and impossible keep them water solution because they are stronger bases than the hydroxide they deprotonate the conjugate acid for the ethoxide ion conjugate base the presence water undergoes this here are some butyl lithium lithium diisopropylamide nli lithium diethylamide nli sodium amide nanh sodium hydride lithium amide nli bases catalysts basic substances can used insoluble heterogeneous catalysts for chemical reactions some examples are metal oxides such magnesium oxide calcium oxide and barium oxide well potassium fluoride alumina and some zeolites many transition metals make good many which form basic basic catalysts have been used for hydrogenations the migration double bonds the meerwein verley reduction the michael reaction and many other uses bases sodium hydroxide used manufacture paper and synthetic fiber called rayon calcium hydroxide slaked used the manufacture bleaching magnesium hydroxide used neutralize excess acid the stomach and cure sodium carbonate used washing soda and for softening hard sodium hydrogen carbonate used baking soda cooking for making baking antacid cure indigestion and soda acid fire etymology the term the concept base stems from older alchemichal notion the the term appears have been first used the french louis mery synonym for the older paracelsian term keeping with century animism paracelsus had postulated that naturally occurring salts grew within the earth result universal acid seminal principle having impregnated earthy matrix its modern meaning and general introduction into the chemical however usually attributed the french guillaume ois rouelle rouelle explicitly defined neutral salt the product formed the union acid with any soluble volatile absorbent capable serving for the salt giving concrete solid most acids known the century were volatile liquids capable whereas their very were crystalline hence was the substance that neutralized the acid which supposedly destroyed the volatility spirit the acid and which imparted the property solidity gave concrete the resulting see also acids base reactions richness used referring conjugate base titration further reading jensen
