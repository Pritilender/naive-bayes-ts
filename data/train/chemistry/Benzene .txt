discovery the word benzene derives historically from gum sometimes called benjamin benzoin resin aromatic resin known european pharmacists and perfumers since the century product southeast acidic material was derived from benzoin and named flowers benzoic the hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzol michael faraday first isolated and identified benzene from the oily residue derived from the production illuminating giving the name bicarburet hydrogen eilhard mitscherlich produced via the distillation benzoic acid from gum benzoin and lime gave the compound the name benzin the french chemist auguste laurent named the substance this the root the word phenol which hydroxylated benzene and phenyl which the radical formed abstraction hydrogen atom free radical from charles mansfield working under august wilhelm von hofmann isolated benzene from coal tar four years mansfield began the first scale production based the tar gradually the sense developed among chemists that substances related benzene represent diverse chemical august wilhelm hofmann used the word aromatic designate this family after characteristic property many its benzene was detected deep space ring formula the empirical formula for benzene was long but its highly polyunsaturated structure with just one hydrogen atom for each carbon atom was challenging archibald scott couper and joseph loschmidt suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds multiple but too little evidence was then available help chemists decide any particular the german chemist friedrich august published paper french for was then teaching francophone suggesting that the structure contained membered ring carbon atoms with alternating single and double the next year published much longer paper german the same kekul used evidence that had accumulated the intervening that there always appeared only one isomer any monoderivative and that there always appeared exactly three isomers every disubstituted now understood correspond the meta and para patterns arene substitution argue support his proposed kekul symmetrical ring could explain these curious well carbon hydrogen dewar benzene prismane the new understanding and hence all aromatic proved important for both pure and applied chemistry that the german chemical society organized elaborate appreciation celebrating the fifth anniversary his first benzene here spoke the creation the said that had discovered the ring shape the benzene molecule after having reverie dream snake seizing its own tail this common symbol many ancient cultures known the ouroboros endless knot this came him after years studying the nature carbon this was years after had solved the problem how carbon atoms could bond four other atoms the same curious that humorous depiction benzene had appeared the berichte der durstigen chemischen gesellschaft journal the thirsty chemical parody the berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft only the parody had monkeys seizing each other rather than snakes some historians have suggested that the parody was lampoon the snake possibly already well known through oral transmission even had not yet appeared some others have speculated that story was parody the monkey and was mere invention rather than recollection event his citation needed kekul speech which these anecdotes appeared has been translated into the anecdote the memory real circumstances mentioned the story suggest that must have happened early the cyclic nature benzene was finally confirmed the crystallographer kathleen lonsdale early applications the and benzene was used shave lotion because its pleasant prior the benzene was frequently used industrial especially for degreasing its toxicity became benzene was supplanted other especially toluene methyl which has similar physical properties but not ludwig roselius popularized the use benzene decaffeinate coffee this discovery led the production sanka this process was later benzene was historically used significant component many consumer products such liquid several paint rubber spot removers and other containing some ceased manufacture their containing formulations about while others continued use benzene component significant contaminant until the late when leukemia deaths were found associated with pliofilm production operations until the late many hardware paint and other retail outlets sold benzene small such quart for purpose many students were exposed benzene school and university courses while performing laboratory experiments with little ventilation many this very dangerous practice has been almost totally structure aromaticity benzene represents special problem account for the bond lengths there must either electron delocalization molecular orbital theory spin coupling the orbitals valence bond theory ray diffraction shows that all six carbon bonds benzene are the same picometres the bond lengths are greater than double but shorter than single this intermediate distance consistent with electron delocalization the electrons for bonding are distributed equally between each the six carbon benzene has hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding parent hexane the molecule the description involves the formation three delocalized orbitals spanning all six carbon while theory the aromatic properties benzene originate from spin coupling all six orbitals likely that this stability contributes the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known aromaticity indicate the delocalized nature the benzene often depicted with circle inside hexagonal arrangement carbon common organic the carbon atoms the diagram above have been left realizing each carbon has each carbon donates electron into the delocalized ring above and below the benzene the overlap orbitals that produces the derivatives benzene occur sufficiently often component organic molecules that there unicode symbol the miscellaneous technical block with the code represent with three double and for delocalized benzene derivatives aromatic hydrocarbons alkylbenzenes many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene replacing one more its hydrogen atoms with another functional group examples simple benzene derivatives are phenol toluene and aniline abbreviated phme and phnh respectively linking benzene rings gives biphenyl further loss hydrogen gives fused aromatic such naphthalene and anthracene the limit the fusion process the free allotrope graphite heterocycles carbon atoms the benzene ring are replaced with other the most important derivatives are the rings containing nitrogen replacing one with gives the compound pyridine although benzene and pyridine are structurally related benzene cannot converted into replacement second bond with depending the location the second pyridazine pyrimidine and pyrazine production four chemical processes contribute industrial benzene catalytic reforming toluene hydrodealkylation toluene and steam cracking according the atsdr toxicological profile for between and catalytic reformats accounted for approximately the total benzene until world war most benzene was produced product coke production oven light the steel industry however the increased demand for especially from the growing polymers industry necessitated the production benzene from today most benzene comes from the petrochemical industry with only small fraction being produced from catalytic reforming catalytic mixture hydrocarbons with boiling points between blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed bifunctional platinum chloride rhenium chloride catalyst and pressures ranging from atm under these aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen become aromatic the aromatic products the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture extraction with any one number solvents including diethylene glycol sulfolane and benzene then separated from the other aromatics the extraction step aromatics from the reformate designed produce aromatics with lowest aromatic recovery the commonly referred btx toluene and xylene involves such extraction and distillation there are good many licensed processes available for extraction the similar fashion this catalytic uop and commercialized method from lpg mainly propane and toluene hydrodealkylation toluene hydrodealkylation converts toluene this intensive toluene mixed with then passed over chromium molybdenum platinum oxide catalyst and atm sometimes higher temperatures are used instead catalyst the similar reaction under these toluene undergoes dealkylation benzene and methane this irreversible reaction accompanied equilibrium side reaction that produces biphenyl aka higher the raw material stream contains much aromatic components paraffins those are likely decomposed lower hydrocarbons such which increases the consumption typical reaction yield exceeds sometimes xylenes and heavier aromatics are used place with similar this often called methodology produce compared conventional btx extraction toluene disproportionation where chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene then toluene disproportionation tdp may attractive alternative the toluene the broad toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule the yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene given that demand for para xylene xylene substantially exceeds demand for other xylene refinement the tdp process called selective tdp may this the xylene stream exiting the tdp unit approximately paraxylene some current catalytic even the xylenes ratio decreased more when the demand xylenes steam cracking steam cracking the process for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons depending the feedstock used produce the steam cracking can produce rich liquid product called pyrolysis gasoline pyrolysis gasoline can blended with other hydrocarbons gasoline routed through extraction process recover btx aromatics toluene and other sources trace amounts benzene may result whenever carbon rich materials undergo incomplete combustion produced volcanoes and forest fires and also component cigarette smoke benzene principal product from the combustion pvc polyvinyl uses benzene used mainly intermediate make other about benzene consumed the production three ethylbenzene cumene and cyclohexane its most widely produced derivative precursor styrene which used make polymers and cumene converted phenol for resins and cyclohexane used the manufacture smaller amounts benzene are used make some types rubbers lubricants dyes detergents drugs explosives and pesticides both the and benzene used the production ethylbenzene used the production cumene and about benzene used the production cyclohexane eventually nylon citation needed the production and demand for benzene the middle east register the greatest increases will probably see its share the global supply and demand expand and percentage respectively until however the pacific region will continue dominate the market and account for almost half the global laboratory toluene now often used substitute for the properties the two are but toluene less toxic and has wider liquid component gasoline gasoline additive benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the when tetraethyl lead replaced the most widely used antiknock with the global phaseout leaded benzene has made comeback gasoline additive some the united states concern over its negative health effects and the possibility entering the groundwater have led stringent regulation benzene with limits typically around european petrol specifications now contain the same limit benzene the united states environmental protection agency introduced new regulations that lowered the benzene content gasoline reactions the most common reactions benzene involve substitution proton other electrophilic aromatic substitution general method derivatizing benzene sufficiently nucleophilic that undergoes substitution acylium ions and alkyl carbocations give substituted the most widely practiced example this reaction the ethylation approximately tons were produced highly instructive but far less industrial significance the friedel crafts alkylation benzene and many other aromatic using alkyl halide the presence strong lewis acid similarly the friedel crafts acylation related example electrophilic aromatic substitution the reaction involves the acylation benzene many other aromatic with acyl chloride using strong lewis acid catalyst such aluminium chloride iron chloride sulfonation chlorination nitration using electrophilic aromatic many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene sulfonation benzene involves the use oleum mixture sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful detergents nitration benzene reacts with nitronium ions which strong electrophile produced combining sulfuric and nitric nitrobenzene the precursor aniline chlorination achieved with chlorine give chlorobenzene the presence catalyst such aluminium hydrogenation via hydrogenation benzene and its derivatives convert cyclohexane and this reaction achieved the use high pressures hydrogen high temperatures the presence finely divided nickel which serves catalyst the absence the benzene impervious this reaction practiced very large scale metal complexes benzene excellent ligand the organometallic chemistry
