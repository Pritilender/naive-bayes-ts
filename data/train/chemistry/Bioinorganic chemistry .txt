metalloproteins well artificially introduced including those that are non essential medicine and many biological processes such respiration depend upon molecules that fall within the realm inorganic chemistry the discipline also includes the study inorganic models mimics that imitate the behaviour mix biochemistry and inorganic chemistry bioinorganic chemistry important elucidating the

ptcl the first protein ever crystallized see james sumner was urease later shown contain nickel its active site vitamin the cure for pernicious anemia was shown crystallographically dorothy crowfoot hodgkin consist cobalt corrin macrocycle the crick structure for dna demonstrated the key structural role played containing themes bioinorganic chemistry several distinct systems are identifiable bioinorganic major areas metal ion transport and storage this topic covers diverse collection ion channels ion pumps nakatpase vacuoles siderophores and other proteins and small molecules which control the concentration metal ions the one issue that many metals that are metabolically required are not readily available owing solubility organisms have developed number strategies for collecting such elements and transporting enzymology many reactions life sciences involve water and metal ions are often the catalytic centers active for these these are metalloproteins often the reacting water ligand see metal aquo complex examples hydrolase enzymes are carbonic anhydrase metallo phosphatases and metalloproteinases bioinorganic chemist seek understand and replicate the function these metal containing electron transfer proteins are also they can organized into three major iron sulfur proteins such rubredoxins ferredoxins and rieske proteins blue copper proteins and cytochromes these electron transport proteins are complementary the metal electron transporters nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide oxygen transport and activation proteins transition metal dioxygen complex aerobic life make extensive use metals such copper and heme utilized red blood cells the form hemoglobin for oxygen transport and perhaps the most recognized metal system other oxygen transport systems include myoglobin hemocyanin and hemerythrin oxidases and oxygenases are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage oxygen carry out important reactions such energy generation cytochrome oxidase small molecule oxidation cytochrome oxidases methane monooxygenase some metalloproteins are designed protect biological system from the potentially harmful effects oxygen and other reactive containing molecules such hydrogen peroxide these systems include peroxidases catalases and superoxide dismutases complementary metalloprotein those that react with oxygen the oxygen evolving complex present this system part the complex protein machinery that produces oxygen plants perform photosynthesis bioorganometallic chemistry bioorganometallic systems includes the hydrogenases and methylcobalamin examples naturally occurring organometallic compounds this area more focused the utilization metals unicellular bioorganometallic compounds are significant environmental chemistry the nitrogen cycle make extensive use metals for the redox nitrogenase one the more famous metalloproteins associated with nitrogen more the cardiovascular and neuronal importance nitric oxide has been including the enzyme nitric oxide synthase see nitrogen assimilation metals medicine metals medicine surprising number drugs contain this theme relies ons the study the design and mechanism action containing and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions enzyme active this diverse field includes the platinum and ruthenium cancer drugs cisplatin chelating gold drug and gadolinium contrast agents lithium carbonate has been used treat the manic phase bipolar antiarthritic auranofin are based environmental chemistry this section does not cite any

interaction heavy metals with methylmercury has caused major disaster called minamata disease arsenic poisoning widespread problem owing largely arsenic contamination groundwater which affects many millions people developing the metabolism and containing compounds involves cobalamin based types inorganic elements biology alkali and alkaline earth metals monensin the abundant inorganic elements act ionic electrolytes the most important ions are sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate the maintenance precise gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and ions are also critical for nerves and muscles action potentials these tissues are produced the exchange electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins the cell membrane called ion channels for muscle contraction depends upon the movement sodium and potassium through ion channels the cell membrane and tubules transition metals the transition metals are usually present trace elements with zinc and iron being most these metals are used some proteins cofactors and are essential for the activity enzymes such catalase and carrier proteins such hemoglobin these cofactors are bound tightly specific although enzyme cofactors can modified during cofactors always return their original state after catalysis has taken the metal micronutrients are taken into organisms specific transporters and bound storage proteins such ferritin metallothionein when not being cobalt essential for the functioning vitamin main group compounds many other elements aside from metals are sulfur and phosphorus are required for all phosphorus almost exclusively exists phosphate and its various esters sulfur exists variety oxidation ranging from sulfate down sulfide selenium trace element involved proteins that are cadmium important because its
