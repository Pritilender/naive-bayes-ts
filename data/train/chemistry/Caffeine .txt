infusions extracted from the seed the coffee plant and the leaves the tea bush well from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut other sources include yerba guarana berries guayusa and the yaupon holly caffeine acts central nervous system stimulant temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring the most widely consumed psychoactive drug but unlike many other psychoactive legal and unregulated nearly all parts the beverages containing such coffee tea soft drinks and energy drinks enjoy great north adults consume caffeine part the reason caffeine classified the food and drug administration generally recognized safe that toxic doses over grams for average are much higher than typically used doses less than milligrams ordinary consumption has low health even when carried for there may modest protective effect against some including parkinson disease heart disease and certain types cancer some people experience sleep disruption they consume especially during the evening but others show little disturbance and the effect caffeine sleep highly evidence risk pregnancy with some authorities concluding that wise for pregnant women limit consumption the equivalent two cups coffee per day caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered people who are not used but regular users develop tolerance this and studies have generally failed

temporary pain relief for headaches caused low cerebrospinal fluid caffeine consumption during pregnancy does not appear increase the risk congenital malformations miscarriage growth retardation even when consumed moderate high however the data supporting this conclusion poor quality some suggest limiting caffeine consumption during for example the food standards agency has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine out less than caffeine the equivalent two cups instant one and half two cups fresh the american congress obstetricians and gynecologists concluded that caffeine consumption safe per day pregnant although the evidence that caffeine may harmful during pregnancy there some evidence that the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy slow the metabolic

with induced sleep disorder individual who regularly ingests high doses caffeine sufficient induce significant disturbance his her sufficiently severe warrant clinical the effect caffeine people with adhd not some studies have however found modest protective effect against alzheimer disease but the evidence caffeine can have negative effects anxiety number clinical studies have shown positive association between caffeine and anxiogenic effects panic disorder high typically greater than caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety rarely trigger mania psychosis moderate doses caffeine may reduce symptoms depression and lower suicide risk moderate doses caffeine typically does not affect learning memory and can improve cognitive especially people who are possibly due its effect for some anxiety can very much reduced discontinuing caffeine caffeine toxicity caffeine overdose can result state central nervous system stimulation called caffeine intoxication dsm this syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion large amounts well over the amounts found typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets more than the symptoms caffeine intoxication are comparable the symptoms overdoses other stimulants they may include fidgeting anxiety excitement insomnia flushing the increased gastrointestinal muscle rambling flow thought and irritability irregular rapid heart and psychomotor agitation cases much larger mania depression lapses disorientation disinhibition delusions hallucinations psychosis may and rhabdomyolysis breakdown skeletal muscle can extreme overdose can result the median lethal dose given orally milligrams per kilogram the caffeine humans dependent individual but estimated about milligrams per kilogram body mass roughly cups coffee for average though achieving lethal dose caffeine would difficult with regular easier reach high doses with caffeine and the lethal dose can lower individuals whose ability metabolize caffeine chronic liver disease one factor that can slow the metabolism there has been reported death man who had liver cirrhosis overdosing caffeinated drugs such fluvoxamine levofloxacin can have similar effect blocking the liver enzyme responsible for the metabolism thus increasing the central effects and blood concentrations caffeine the exact cause death such cases but may result from cardiac arrhythmia leading cardiac arrest treatment severe caffeine intoxication generally providing treatment the immediate but the patient has very high serum levels caffeine then peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis

tolerance develops quickly some but not effects especially among heavy coffee and energy drink some coffee drinkers develop tolerance its disrupting but others apparently withdrawal withdrawal symptoms including irritability inability drowsiness insomnia and pain the upper and may appear within hours after discontinuation caffeine peak roughly hours and usually last from days withdrawal headaches are experienced people who stopped consuming caffeine for two days after average caffeine per day prior prolonged caffeine symptoms such increased depression and nausea vomiting physical pains and intense desire for caffeine are also peer support and interaction may aid caffeine withdrawal categorized mental disorder the dsm the edition the diagnostic and statistical manual published the american psychiatric association previous versions the manual included caffeine but not caffeine sources and consumption caffeinated drink excedrin hershey special dark bar hershey milk chocolate bar percolated coffee drip coffee decaffeinated espresso tea types millilitres yerba mate coca cola mountain dew pepsi guaran antarctica jolt cola red bull global consumption caffeine has been estimated tonnes per making the most popular psychoactive this amounts one serving caffeinated beverage for every person every caffeine found many plant species where acts natural pesticide with high caffeine levels being observed seedlings still developing foliage but lacking mechanical caffeine paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding the high caffeine levels have also been found the surrounding soil coffee bean therefore caffeine understood have natural function both natural pesticide and inhibitor seed germination other nearby coffee thus giving better chance caffeine has also been found enhance the reward memory improving the reproductive success the common sources caffeine are tea soft drinks and energy drinks caffeine and lesser chocolate derived from cocoa beans less commonly used sources caffeine include the yerba guarana and ilex guayusa plants which are sometimes used the preparation teas and energy two alternative mateine and guaranine are derived from the names these the disparity experience and effects between the various natural caffeine sources could because plant sources caffeine also contain widely varying mixtures other xanthine alkaloids including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine and other substances such polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with clarification needed one the primary sources caffeine the coffee bean which the seed the coffee plant from which coffee caffeine content coffee varies widely depending the type coffee bean and the method preparation even beans within given bush can show variations one serving coffee ranges from milligrams for single shot milliliters variety espresso approximately milligrams for cup milliliters drip coffee arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine the robusta variety dark roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces small amount the caffeine tea contains more caffeine than coffee dry typical however contains much since tea normally brewed much also contributing caffeine content are growing processing and other thus certain types tea may contain somewhat more caffeine than other tea contains small amounts theobromine and slightly higher levels theophylline than preparation and many other factors have significant impact and color very poor indicator caffeine teas like the pale japanese green tea gyokuro for contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong which has very caffeine also common ingredient soft drinks such cola originally prepared from kola nuts soft drinks typically contain about milligrams caffeine per energy drinks such red bull can start milligrams caffeine per the caffeine these drinks either originates from the ingredients used additive derived from the product decaffeination from chemical guarana prime ingredient energy contains large amounts caffeine with small amounts theobromine and theophylline naturally occurring slow release excipient chocolate derived from cocoa beans contains small amount the weak stimulant effect chocolate may due combination theobromine and well typical gram serving milk chocolate bar has about much caffeine cup decaffeinated although dark chocolate has about the same caffeine coffee some dark chocolate currently production contains much per which double the caffeine content the highest caffeinated drip coffee various manufacturers market caffeine claiming that using caffeine pharmaceutical quality improves mental these effects have been borne out research that shows caffeine use whether tablet form results decreased fatigue and increased these tablets are commonly used students studying for their exams and people who work drive for long one company also marketing dissolving caffeine strips alternative energy another unusual intake route spazzstick caffeinated lip balm number innovative caffeinated products such alert energy caffeine wrigley had been introduced the united but were under after announcement investigation the fda the health effects added caffeine alert energy caffeine gum was voluntarily withdrawn from inhaled caffeine distribution method under scrutiny some lawmakers chemical properties and biosynthesis biosynthesis laboratory synthesis pure anhydrous caffeine white colorless powder with melting point caffeine moderately soluble water room temperature but very soluble boiling water also moderately soluble ethanol weakly basic requiring strong acid protonate caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers and hence classified achiral molecule the xanthine core caffeine contains two fused pyrimidinedione and imidazole the pyrimidinedione turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominately zwitterionic resonance form where the nitrogen atoms are double bonded their adjacent amide carbons hence all six the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are hybridized and therefore the fused ring core caffeine contains total ten electrons and hence according rule aromatic caffeine synthesized plants from the purine nucleotides amp gmp and imp these turn are transformed into xanthosine and then theobromine the latter being the penultimate precursor being readily available byproduct caffeine not usually synthesized chemically may synthesized from dimethylurea and malonic acid pharmacology inside the body caffeine acts through several but its most important effect counteract substance called adenosine that naturally circulates high levels throughout the and especially the nervous the adenosine plays generally protective part which reduce neural activity for there some evidence that adenosine helps induce torpor animals that seasonally mechanism action antagonist adenosine adenosine acts inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity the central nervous largely consequence its blockade adenosine receptors caffeine also has profound effects most the other major including acetylcholine serotonin and high and small extent epinephrine glutamate and cortisol citation needed high exceeding milligrams caffeine inhibits gaba neurotransmission gaba reduction explains why caffeine increases insomnia rapid heart and respiration citation needed because caffeine both and readily crosses the blood brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior the once the the principal mode action nonselective antagonist adenosine receptors other agent that reduces the effects the caffeine molecule structurally similar and capable binding adenosine receptors the surface cells without activating thereby acting competitive inhibitor adenosine found every part the because plays role the fundamental adenosine triphosphate related energy producing mechanism and also needed for rna synthesis but has additional functions the the evidence indicates that brain adenosine acts protect the brain suppressing neural activity and increasing blood flow via receptors located vascular smooth brain adenosine levels are increased various types metabolic including lack oxygen and interruption blood flow there evidence that adenosine functions synaptically released neurotransmitter some parts the however stress related adenosine increases appear produced mainly extracellular metabolism unlike most adenosine does not seem packaged into vesicles that are released controlled but the possibility such mechanism has not been fully ruled several classes adenosine receptors have been with different anatomical receptors are widely and act inhibit calcium receptors are heavily concentrated the basal area that plays critical role behavior but can found other parts the brain lower there evidence that receptors interact with the dopamine system which involved reward and receptors can also found arterial walls and blood cell beyond its general neuroprotective there are reasons believe that adenosine may more specifically involved control the wake robert mccarley and his colleagues have argued that accumulation adenosine may primary cause the sensation sleepiness that follows prolonged mental and that the effects may mediated both inhibition promoting neurons via receptors and activation promoting neurons via indirect effects receptors more recent studies have provided additional evidence for the importance but not receptors caffeine like other xanthines also acts phosphodiesterase inhibitor competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor caffeine raises intracellular camp activates protein kinase inhibits alpha and leukotriene synthesis and reduces inflammation and innate immunity number potential mechanisms have been proposed for the athletic enhancing effects the metabolic caffeine may increase fat utilization and decrease glycogen caffeine mobilizes free fatty acids from fat intramuscular triglycerides increasing circulating epinephrine levels the increased availability free fatty acids increases fat oxidation and spares muscle glycogen thereby enhancing endurance the nervous caffeine may reduce the perception effort lowering the neuron activation making easier recruit the muscles for caffeine metabolites metabolites caffeine also contribute paraxanthine responsible for increase the lipolysis process which releases glycerol and fatty acids into the blood used source fuel the theobromine vasodilator that increases the amount oxygen and nutrient flow the brain and theophylline acts smooth muscle relaxant that chiefly affects bronchioles and acts chronotrope and inotrope that increases heart rate and force metabolism paraxanthine theobromine theophylline caffeine from coffee other beverages absorbed the small intestine within minutes ingestion and then distributed throughout all tissues the peak blood concentration reached within hours eliminated first order kinetics caffeine can also absorbed evidenced the formulation suppositories ergotamine tartrate and caffeine for the relief migraine and chlorobutanol and caffeine for the treatment hyperemesis the biological life the time required for the body eliminate half the total amount varies widely among individuals according such factors liver pregnancy some concurrent and the level enzymes the liver needed for caffeine can also significantly altered drugs hormonal healthy caffeine life has been measured with range some measures get hours and others are around hours heavy cigarette smokers show decrease life oral contraceptives can double and pregnancy can raise even much hours during the last newborn infants the life can hours however drops very rapidly with possibly less than the adult value the age months the antidepressant fluvoxamine reduces the clearance caffeine more than and prolongs its elimination life more than from hours hours caffeine metabolized the liver the cytochrome oxidase enzyme the cyp isozyme into three dimethyl xanthines each which has its own effects the paraxanthine increases lipolysis leading elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels the blood plasma theobromine dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume theobromine also the principal alkaloid the cocoa bean and therefore chocolate theophylline relaxes smooth muscles the bronchi and used treat asthma the therapeutic dose however many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine citation needed each these metabolites further metabolized and then excreted the caffeine can accumulate individuals with severe liver disease increasing its some quinolone antibiotics exert inhibitory effect thereby reducing clearance caffeine and thus increasing blood review found that habitual caffeine intake was associated with variation two genes that regulate how quickly the body processes subjects who had intake mutation both chromosomes consumed more caffeine per day than people who did detection biological fluids caffeine can quantified plasma serum monitor therapy confirm

competitive sports for which level excess usually considered represent decaffeination decaffeination crystals dark field light microscope extraction caffeine from produce decaffeinated coffee and important quantify industrial process and can performed using number benzene chloroform trichloroethylene and dichloromethane have all been used over the years but for reasons environmental cost and they have been superseded the following main water coffee beans are soaked the which contains many other compounds addition caffeine and contributes the flavor then passed through activated charcoal which removes the the water can then put back with the beans and evaporated leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell for use soft drinks and counter caffeine supercritical carbon dioxide supercritical carbon dioxide excellent nonpolar solvent for and safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise the extraction process forced through the green coffee beans temperatures above and pressures above atm under these supercritical state has gaslike properties that allow penetrate deep into the beans but also like properties that dissolve the the laden then sprayed with high pressure water remove the the caffeine can then isolated charcoal adsorption distillation recrystallization reverse osmosis extraction organic certain organic solvents such ethyl acetate present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used another method use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee decaffeinated coffees fact contain caffeine many some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable one study found that decaffeinated coffee contained caffeine per compared approximately caffeine per cup for regular history coffeehouse palestine history chocolate history coffee history tea history yerba mate according chinese the chinese emperor shennong reputed have reigned about bce accidentally discovered tea when noted that when certain leaves fell into boiling fragrant and restorative drink shennong also mentioned cha jing famous early work the subject the earliest credible evidence either coffee drinking knowledge the coffee tree appears the middle the fifteenth the sufi monasteries the yemenin southern from mocha coffee spread egypt and north and the had reached the rest the middle persia and turkey from the middle coffee drinking spread then the rest and coffee plants were transported the dutch the east indies and the use the kola nut like

government seized barrels and kegs coca cola syrup chattanooga tennessee alleging the caffeine its drink was injurious although the judge ruled favor two bills were introduced the house representatives amend the pure food and drug act adding caffeine the list and deleterious substances which must listed unreliable the earliest evidence cocoa bean use comes from residue found ancient mayan pot dated bce the new chocolate was consumed bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl often seasoned with vanilla chile pepper and achiote xocolatl was believed fight belief probably attributable the theobromine and caffeine chocolate was important luxury good throughout pre columbian mesoamerica and cocoa beans were often used citation needed xocolatl was introduced europe the spaniards and became popular beverage the spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the west indies and the philippines was used alchemical processes where was known black citation needed the leaves and stems the yaupon holly ilex vomitoria were used native americans brew tea called asi the black drink archaeologists have found evidence this use stretch back far into possibly dating late archaic times discovery the german chemist friedlieb ferdinand runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first called kaffebase base that exists according did this the behest johann wolfgang von goethe caffeine was isolated both the french chemist pierre jean robiquet and another pair french pierre joseph pelletier and joseph caventou according swedish chemist jacob berzelius his yearly furthermore berzelius stated that the french chemists had made their discoveries independently any knowledge each however berzelius later acknowledged priority the extraction stating this should not remain unmentioned that runge his phytochemical discoveries pages specified the same method and described caffeine under the name caffeebase year earlier than whom the discovery this substance usually having made the first oral announcement about meeting the pharmacy society pelletier article caffeine was the first use the term print the french form caf ine from the french word for caf corroborates caffeine noun crystallizable substance discovered coffee robiquet during the same while they were searching for quinine coffee because coffee considered several doctors medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs the same family the cinchona tree their messrs pelletier and caventou obtained but because their research had different goal and because their research had not been they left priority this subject robiquet not know why robiquet has not published the analysis coffee which read the pharmacy its publication would have allowed make caffeine better known and give accurate ideas robiquet was one the first isolate and describe the properties pure whereas pelletier was the first perform elemental analysis oudry isolated from but was later proved mulder and carl jobst that theine was actually german chemist hermann emil fischer first synthesized caffeine from raw materials total synthesis and two years also derived the structural formula the this was part the work for which fischer was awarded the nobel prize legality because caffeine psychoactive often the united the food and drug administration restricts beverages containing less than caffeine historically coffee and thus caffeine was illegal for some classes mecca parts the and the ottoman charles england tried ban frederick prussia banned and coffee was banned sweden the years and the bans coffee have often had economic political reasons rather than being based concerns for the being the citation needed religion some seventh day adventists church god adherents and christian scientists not consume

following with regard caffeinated with reference cola the church has never officially taken position this but the leaders the church have and now specifically against the use any drink containing harmful forming drugs under circumstances that would result acquiring the any beverage that contains ingredients harmful the body should gaudiya vaishnavas generally also abstain from alleged cloud
