between opposite either between electrons and nuclei the result dipole attraction the strength chemical bonds varies there are strong such covalent ionic bonds and weak such dipole dipole interactions the london dispersion force and hydrogen bonding since opposite charges attract via simple electromagnetic force the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons the nucleus attract each electron positioned between two nuclei will attracted both and the nuclei will attracted toward electrons this this attraction constitutes the chemical due the matter wave nature electrons and their smaller they must occupy much larger amount volume compared with the and this volume occupied the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei relatively far compared with

bonding situations that there clear line drawn between the behaviors atoms become qualitatively different the character the bond changes quantitatively that remains useful and customary differentiate between the bonds that cause these different properties condensed matter the simplest view called bond one more electrons often pair are drawn into the space between the two atomic here the negatively charged electrons are attracted the positive charges both nuclei instead just their this overcomes the repulsion between the two positively charged nuclei the two and this overwhelming attraction holds the two nuclei fixed configuration even though they will still vibrate equilibrium thus covalent bonding involves sharing electrons which the positively charged nuclei two more atoms simultaneously attract the negatively charged electrons that are being shared between these bonds exist between two particular identifiable and have direction allowing them shown single connecting lines between atoms modeled sticks between spheres polar covalent bond one more electrons are unequally shared between two covalent bonds often result the formation small collections connected atoms called molecules which solids and liquids are bound other molecules forces that are often much weaker than the covalent bonds that hold the molecules internally such weak intermolecular bonds give organic molecular such waxes and their soft bulk and their low melting points molecules must cease most structured oriented contact with each when covalent bonds link long chains atoms large however polymers such nylon when covalent bonds extend networks through solids that are not composed discrete molecules such diamond quartz the silicate minerals many types then the structures that result may both strong and least the direction oriented correctly with networks covalent also the melting points such covalent polymers and networks increase simplified view ionic bond the bonding electron not shared but this type the outer atomic orbital one atom has vacancy which allows addition one more these newly added electrons potentially occupy lower state effectively closer more nuclear than they experience different thus one nucleus offers more tightly bound position electron than does another with the result that one atom may transfer electron the this transfer causes one atom assume net positive and the other assume net negative the bond then results from electrostatic attraction between and the atoms become positive negatively charged ions ionic bonds may seen extreme examples polarization covalent often such bonds have particular orientation since they result from equal electrostatic attraction each ion all ions around ionic bonds are strong and thus ionic substances require high temperatures but also since the forces between ions are and not easily bridge cracks and this type bond gives rise the physical characteristics crystals classic mineral such table less often mentioned type bonding the metallic bond this type each atom metal donates one more electrons sea electrons that reside between many metal this each electron free virtue its wave associated with great many atoms the bond results because the metal atoms become somewhat positively charged due loss their while the electrons remain attracted many without being part any given metallic bonding may seen extreme example delocalization electrons over large system covalent which every atom this type bonding often very strong resulting the tensile strength however metallic bonds are more collective nature than other and they allow metal crystals more easily because they are composed atoms attracted each but not any oriented this results the malleability the sea electrons metallic bonds causes the characteristically good electrical and thermal conductivity and also their shiny reflection most frequencies white all bonds can explained quantum but simplification rules allow chemists predict the directionality and polarity the octet rule and vsepr theory are two more sophisticated theories are valence bond theory which includes orbital hybridization and resonance and the linear combination atomic orbitals molecular orbital method which includes ligand field theory electrostatics are used describe bond polarities and the effects they have chemical history history chemistry history the molecule early speculations into the nature the chemical bond from early the supposed that certain types chemical species were joined type chemical affinity isaac newton famously outlined his atomic bonding query his opticks whereby atoms attach each other some force specifically after acknowledging the various popular theories vogue the how atoms were reasoned attach each hooked glued together stuck together conspiring newton states that would rather infer from their that particles attract one another some force which immediate contact exceedingly small distances performs the chemical and reaches not far from the particles with any sensible the heels the invention the voltaic pile jakob berzelius developed theory chemical combination stressing the electronegative and electropositive character the combining the mid edward frankland kekul couper alexander butlerov and hermann kolbe building the theory radicals developed the theory valency originally called combining which compounds were joined owing attraction positive and negative chemist gilbert lewis developed the concept the electron pair bond which two atoms may share one six thus forming the single electron bond single bond double bond triple bond own electron may form part the shell two different atoms and cannot said belong either one that same walther kossel put forward theory similar only his model assumed complete transfers electrons between and was thus model ionic bonds both lewis and kossel structured their bonding models that abegg rule the first mathematically complete quantum description simple chemical that produced one electron the hydrogen molecular was derived the danish physicist oyvind this work showed that the quantum approach chemical bonds could fundamentally and quantitatively but the mathematical methods used could not extended molecules containing more than one more albeit less approach was put forward the same year walter heitler and fritz london the london method forms the basis what now called valence bond theory the linear combination atomic orbitals molecular orbital method approximation was introduced sir john jones who also suggested methods derive electronic structures molecules fluorine and oxygen molecules from basic quantum this molecular orbital theory represented covalent bond orbital formed combining the quantum mechanical schr dinger atomic orbitals which had been hypothesized for electrons single the equations for bonding electrons electron atoms could not solved mathematical perfection analytically but approximations for them still gave many good qualitative predictions and most quantitative calculations modern quantum chemistry use either valence bond molecular orbital theory starting although third density functional theory has become increasingly popular recent james and coolidge carried out calculation the dihydrogen molecule unlike all previous calculation which used functions only the distance the electron from the atomic used functions which also explicitly added the distance between the two with adjustable parameters they obtained result very close the experimental result for the dissociation later extensions have used parameters and give excellent agreement with this calculation convinced the scientific community that quantum theory could give agreement with however this approach has none the physical pictures the valence bond and molecular orbital theories and difficult extend larger valence bond theory valence bond theory valence bond theory was formulated and argues that chemical bond forms when two valence electrons their respective atomic orbitals work function hold two nuclei virtue effects lowering system building this the chemist linus pauling published what some consider one the most important papers the history the nature the chemical this elaborating the works and the valence bond theory heitler and and his own earlier pauling presented six rules for the shared electron the first three which were already generally his last three rules were building this pauling textbook the nature the chemical bond would become what some have called the bible modern this book helped experimental chemists understand the impact quantum theory however the later edition failed adequately address the problems that appeared better understood molecular orbital the impact valence theory declined during the and molecular orbital theory grew usefulness was implemented large digital computer programs since the the more difficult problems implementing valence bond theory into computer programs have been solved and valence bond theory has seen comparison valence bond and molecular orbital theory some respects valence bond theory superior molecular orbital when applied the simplest electron valence bond even the simplest london gives much closer approximation the bond energy and provides much more accurate representation the behavior the electrons chemical bonds are formed and contrast simple molecular orbital theory predicts that the hydrogen molecule dissociates into linear superposition hydrogen atoms and positive and negative hydrogen completely unphysical this explains part why the curve total energy against interatomic distance for the valence bond method lies below the curve for the molecular orbital method all distances and most particularly for large this situation arises for all homonuclear diatomic molecules and particularly problem for where the minimum energy the curve with molecular orbital theory still higher energy than the energy two the concepts hybridization are and the variability bonding most organic compounds that valence bond theory remains integral part the vocabulary organic however the work friedrich hund robert mulliken and gerhard herzberg showed that molecular orbital theory provided more appropriate description the ionization and magnetic properties the deficiencies valence bond theory became apparent when hypervalent molecules were explained without the use orbitals that were crucial the bonding hybridisation scheme proposed for such molecules metal complexes and electron deficient compounds diborane also appeared well described molecular orbital although valence bond descriptions have been the the two methods strongly competed until was realised that they are both approximations better take the simple valence bond structure and mix all possible covalent and ionic structures arising from particular set atomic reach what called the full configuration interaction wave take the simple molecular orbital description the ground state and combine that function with the functions describing all possible excited states using unoccupied orbitals arising from the same set atomic also reach the full configuration interaction can then seen that the simple molecular orbital approach gives too much weight the ionic while the simple valence bond approach gives too this can also described saying that the molecular orbital approach too delocalised while the valence bond approach too localised the two approaches are now regarded each providing its own insights into the problem chemical modern calculations quantum chemistry usually start from but ultimately far molecular orbital rather than valence bond not because any intrinsic superiority the former but rather because the approach more readily adapted numerical however better valence bond programs are now bonds chemical formulas the fact that atoms and molecules are dimensional makes difficult use single technique for indicating orbitals and molecular formulas the chemical bonds binding between atoms are indicated various methods according the type sometimes they are completely for organic chemistry chemists are sometimes concerned only with the functional groups the thus the molecular formula ethanol may written paper conformational three full dimensional indicating every bond with dimensional compressed dimensional separating the functional group from another part the molecule its atomic constituents according what sometimes even the bonding valence shell electrons with the dimensional approximate are for elemental carbon some chemists may also mark the respective the hypothetical ethene anion indicating the possibility bond strong chemical bonds typical bond lengths and bond energies hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen halogens strong chemical bonds are the intramolecular forces which hold atoms together molecules strong chemical bond formed from the transfer sharing electrons between atomic centers and relies the electrostatic attraction between the protons nuclei and the electrons the although these bonds typically involve the transfer integer numbers electrons this the bond order which represents one transferred electron two shared some systems can have intermediate numbers example this the organic molecule benzene where the bond order for each carbon meaning that has bonds shares three with each one its two the types strong bond differ due the difference electronegativity the constituent large difference electronegativity leads more polar character the ionic bond ionic bond ionic bonding type electrostatic interaction between atoms which have large electronegativity there precise value that distinguishes ionic from covalent but difference electronegativity over likely and difference less than likely ionic bonding leads separate positive and negative ions ionic charges are commonly between ionic bonding commonly occurs metal salts such sodium chloride table typical feature ionic bonds that the species form into ionic which ion specifically paired with any single other specific directional rather each species ion surrounded ions the opposite and the spacing between and each the oppositely charged ions near the same for all surrounding atoms the same thus longer possible associate ion with any specific other single ionized atom near this situation unlike that covalent where covalent bonds between specific atoms are still discernible from the shorter distances between measured via such techniques ray diffraction ionic crystals may contain mixture covalent and ionic for example salts complex such sodium nacn many minerals are this ray diffraction shows that for the bonds between sodium cations and the cyanide anions are ionic with sodium ion associated with any particular however the bonds between and atoms cyanide are the covalent type making each the carbon and nitrogen associated with just one its opposite which physically much closer than other carbons nitrogens sodium cyanide when such crystals are melted into the ionic bonds are broken first because they are directional and allow the charged species move similarly when such salts dissolve into the ionic bonds are typically broken the interaction with but the covalent bonds continue for the cyanide still bound together single ions move independently through the sodium charged ions move apart because each them are more strongly attracted number water than each the attraction between ions and water molecules such solutions due type weak dipole dipole type chemical melted ionic the ions continue attracted each but not any ordered crystalline covalent bond covalent bond covalent bonding common type which the electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms small bonds within most organic compounds are described see sigma bonds and bonds for description such polar covalent bond covalent bond with significant ionic this means that the electrons are closer one the atoms than the creating imbalance they occur bond between two atoms with moderately different and give rise dipole dipole interactions the electronegativity these bonds coordinate covalent bond one where both bonding electrons are from one the atoms involved the these bonds give rise lewis acids and bases the electrons are shared roughly equally between the atoms contrast ionic such bonding occurs molecules such the ammonium ion and are shown arrow pointing the lewis also known polar covalent the electronegativity these bonds range from molecules which are formed primarily from polar covalent bonds are often immiscible water other polar solvents but much more soluble non polar solvents such hexane one and electron bonds dihydrogen cation bonds with one three electrons can found radical species which have odd number the simplest example electron bond found the dihydrogen cation one electron bonds often have about half the bond energy electron and are therefore called half however there are the case dilithium the bond actually stronger for the electron than for the electron this exception can explained terms hybridization and shell the simplest example electron bonding can found the helium dimer considered half because consists only one shared electron rather than addition one lone electron each molecular orbital the third electron bonding orbital which cancels out half the bond formed the other two another example molecule containing electron addition two electron nitric oxide the oxygen can also regarded having two electron bonds and one electron which accounts for its paramagnetism and its formal bond order chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain electron molecules with electron bonds are usually highly these types bond are only stable between atoms with similar bent bonds bent bond bent bonds are bonds strained otherwise sterically hindered molecules whose binding orbitals are forced into like bent bonds are often more susceptible reactions than ordinary resonant bonding resonance hypervalent bonding hypervalent molecule hypervalent there exists bonds which have significant bonding ionic quality this manifests bonding orbital levels molecular orbital theory while valence bond theory analyzed form resonant bonding electron deficient bonding three center electron bonds three atoms share two electrons this type bonding occurs electron deficient compounds like diborane each such bond per molecule contains pair electrons which connect the boron atoms each other banana with proton nucleus hydrogen the middle the sharing electrons with both boron certain cluster compounds called four center electron bonds also have been certain conjugated systems such benzene and other aromatic compounds see and conjugated network solids such graphite the electrons the conjugated system bonds are spread over many nuclear centers exist the the aromatic bonding aromaticity organic chemistry certain configurations electrons and orbitals infer extra stability this occurs when orbitals overlap and combine with others different atomic forming long range for molecule aromatic must obey rule where the number electrons fit the formula where the bonds involved the aromaticity are all benzene the prototypical aromatic bonding electrons bind carbon atoms together form planar ring the bond order average number between the different carbon atoms may said but this case the bonds are all identical from the chemical point they may sometimes written single bonds alternating with double but the view all ring bonds being equivalently about bonds much closer the case heterocyclic aromatics and substituted benzenes the electronegativity differences between different parts the ring may dominate the chemical behaviour aromatic ring which otherwise are metallic bond metallic bond metallic bonding electrons are delocalized over lattice ionic the locations the binding electrons and their charges are the moving delocalization bonding electrons leads classical metallic properties such luster surface light electrical and thermal conductivity ductility and high tensile strength intermolecular bonding intermolecular force there are four basic types bonds that can formed between two more otherwise molecules ions intermolecular forces cause molecules attracted repulsed each often these define some the physical characteristics such the melting point large difference electronegativity between two bonded atoms will cause permanent charge molecule two more molecules ions with permanent dipoles can interact within dipole dipole interactions the bonding electrons molecule ion closer the more electronegative atom more frequently than the less electronegative giving rise partial charges each and causing electrostatic forces between molecules hydrogen bond effectively strong example interaction between two permanent the large difference electronegativities between hydrogen and any fluorine nitrogen and oxygen coupled with their lone pairs electrons cause strong electrostatic forces between hydrogen bonds are responsible for the high boiling points water and ammonia with respect their heavier the london dispersion force arises due instantaneous dipoles neighbouring the negative charge the electron not uniform around the whole there always charge this small charge will induce corresponding dipole nearby causing attraction between the the electron then moves another part the electron cloud and the attraction cation interaction occurs between bond and summary electrons chemical bonds the limit pure ionic bonding electrons are perfectly localized one the two atoms the such bonds can understood classical physics the forces between the atoms are characterized isotropic continuum electrostatic their magnitude simple proportion the charge covalent bonds are better understood valence bond theory molecular orbital theory the properties the atoms involved can understood using concepts such oxidation number the electron density within bond not assigned individual but instead delocalized between valence bond the two electrons the two atoms are coupled together with the bond strength depending the overlap between molecular orbital the linear combination atomic orbitals helps describe the delocalized molecular orbital structures and energies based the atomic orbitals the atoms they came unlike pure ionic covalent bonds may have directed anisotropic properties these may have their own such sigma bond and bond the general atoms form bonds that are intermediates between ionic and depending the relative electronegativity the atoms this type bond sometimes called polar covalent
