chemical compound navigation search water stick model hydrogen oxygen chemical compound pure chemical substance consisting two more different chemical elements that can separated into simpler substances chemical reactions chemical compounds have unique and defined chemical structure they consist fixed ratio atoms that are held together defined spatial arrangement chemical bonds chemical compounds can molecular compounds held together covalent bonds salts held together ionic bonds intermetallic compounds held together metallic bonds complexes held together coordinate covalent bonds pure chemical elements are not considered chemical even they consist molecules that contain only multiple atoms single element such etc which are called diatomic molecules polyatomic molecules contents wider definitions elementary concepts compounds compared mixtures formula phases and thermal properties cas number see also references further reading external links wider definitions there are exceptions the definition and many solid chemical materials familiar earth for example many silicate minerals not have simple formulas which various elements that are chemically bonded each other stand exact and fixed these crystalline compounds are called non stoichiometric compounds they vary composition due either the presence foreign elements trapped within the crystal structure deficit excess the constituent such stoichiometric chemical compounds form most the crust and mantle the other compounds regarded chemically identical may have varying amounts heavy light isotopes the constituent which changes the ratio elements mass elementary concepts characteristic properties elements compound are present definite proportion atoms hydrogen atom oxygen becomes molecule compounds have definite set properties elements that comprise compound not retain their original for hydrogen combustible and supportive oxygen combustible and supportive becomes water combustible and supportive valency the number hydrogen atoms that can combine with one atom the element form compounds compared mixtures the physical and chemical properties compounds differ from those their constituent this one the main criteria that distinguish compound from mixture elements other properties are closely related and depend the properties its another criterion that distinguishes compound from mixture that constituents mixture can usually separated simple mechanical such evaporation magnetic but components compound can separated only chemical however mixtures can created mechanical means but compound can created either from elements from other combination the only chemical some mixtures are intimately combined that they have some properties similar compounds and may easily mistaken for one example alloys alloys are made most commonly heating the constituent metals liquid mixing them and then cooling the mixture quickly that the constituents are trapped the base other examples like mixtures include intermetallic compounds and solutions alkali metals liquid form formula chemical formula chemists describe compounds using formulas various for compounds that exist the formula for the molecular unit for polymeric materials such minerals and many metal oxides the empirical formula normally nacl for table salt the elements chemical formula are normally listed specific called the hill system this the carbon atoms there are are usually listed any hydrogen atoms are listed and all other elements follow alphabetical the formula contains then all the including are listed there however several important exceptions the normal for ionic the positive ion almost always listed first and the negative ion listed for oxygen usually listed organic acids follow the normal rules with and coming first the for the formula for trifluoroacetic acid usually written more descriptive formulas can convey structural such writing the formula for trifluoroacetic acid the other the chemical formulas for most inorganic acids and bases are exceptions the normal they are written according the rules for ionic compounds positive negative but they also follow rules that emphasize their arrhenius the formula for most inorganic acids begins with hydrogen and the formula for most bases ends with the hydroxide ion formulas for inorganic compounds not often convey structural illustrated the common use the formula for molecule sulfuric that contains more descriptive presentation would but almost never written this phases and thermal properties compounds may have several possible phases all compounds can exist solids least low enough molecular compounds may also exist liquids gases and some even plasmas all compounds decompose upon applying heat the temperature which such fragmentation occurs often called the decomposition temperature decomposition temperatures are not sharp and depend the rate cas number every chemical substance including chemical that has been described the literature carries unique numerical identifier its cas number see also chemical element chemical revolution chemical structure chemical name dictionary chemical formulas list chemical
