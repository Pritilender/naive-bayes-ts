when the forward reaction proceeds the same rate the reverse reaction the reaction rates the forward and backward reactions are generally not but thus there are net changes the concentrations the and such state known dynamic equilibrium contents historical introduction thermodynamics addition reactants products treatment activity concentration quotients metastable mixtures pure substances multiple

also references further reading historical introduction burette titration analytical chemistry the concept chemical equilibrium was developed after berthollet found that some chemical reactions are reversible for any reaction mixture exist the rates the forward and backward reactions are the following chemical equation with arrows pointing both ways indicate and are reactant chemical and are product and and are the stoichiometric coefficients the respective reactants and the equilibrium position reaction said lie far the nearly all the reactants are conversely the equilibrium position said far the hardly any product formed from the guldberg and waage building proposed the law mass action where and are active masses and and are rate constants since equilibrium forward and backward rates are and the ratio the rate constants also now known equilibrium constant convention the products form the numerator however the law mass action valid only for concerted step reactions that proceed through single transition state and not valid general because rate equations follow the stoichiometry the reaction guldberg and waage had proposed for nucleophilic aliphatic substitution reaction hydrogen and bromine form hydrogen bromide equality forward and backward reaction however necessary condition for chemical though not sufficient explain why equilibrium despite the failure this the equilibrium constant for reaction indeed independent the activities the various species though does depend temperature observed the van hoff equation adding catalyst will affect both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction the same way and will not have effect the equilibrium the catalyst will speed both reactions thereby increasing the speed which equilibrium although the macroscopic equilibrium concentrations are constant reactions occur the molecular for the case acetic acid dissolved water and forming acetate and hydronium ions proton may hop from one molecule acetic acid water molecule and then acetate anion form another molecule acetic acid and leaving the number acetic acid molecules this example dynamic equilibrium equilibria like the rest are statistical averages microscopic principle gives idea the behavior equilibrium system when changes its reaction conditions dynamic equilibrium disturbed changing the the position equilibrium moves partially reverse the change for adding more from the outside will cause excess and the system will try counteract this increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward though the equilibrium constant will stay the mineral acid added the acetic acid increasing the concentration hydronium the amount dissociation must decrease the reaction driven the left accordance with this this can also deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the increases must increase and must the left out pure liquid and its concentration quantitative version given the reaction quotient gibbs suggested that equilibrium attained when the gibbs free energy the system its minimum value assuming the reaction carried out constant temperature and what this means that the derivative the gibbs energy with respect reaction coordinate measure the extent reaction that has ranging from zero for all reactants maximum for all vanishes signalling stationary point this derivative called the reaction gibbs energy energy and corresponds the difference between the chemical potentials reactants and products the composition the reaction this criterion both necessary and mixture not the liberation the excess gibbs energy helmholtz energy constant volume the driving for the composition the mixture change until equilibrium the equilibrium constant can related the standard gibbs free energy change for the reaction the equation where the universal gas constant and the temperature when the reactants are dissolved medium high ionic strength the quotient activity coefficients may taken that case the concentration quotient where the concentration etc independent the analytical concentration the for this equilibrium constants for solutions are usually determined media high ionic varies with ionic temperature and pressure likewise for gases depends partial pressure these constants are easier measure and encountered school chemistry thermodynamics constant temperature and one must consider the gibbs free energy while constant temperature and one must consider the helmholtz free energy for the and constant internal energy and one must consider the entropy for the the constant volume case important geochemistry and atmospheric chemistry where pressure variations are note reactants and products were standard state completely then there would reversibility and the mixing the products and reactants contributes large entropy known entropy mixing states containing equal mixture products and the combination the standard gibbs energy change and the gibbs energy mixing determines the equilibrium this article only the constant pressure case the relation between the gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant can found considering chemical potentials constant temperature and the gibbs free energy for the reaction depends only the extent reaction greek letter and can only decrease according the second law thermodynamics means that the derivative with must negative the reaction the equilibrium the derivative being equal general equilibrium system defined writing equilibrium equation for the reaction order meet the thermodynamic condition for the gibbs energy must meaning that the derivative with respect the extent reaction must can shown that this the sum chemical potentials the products equal the sum those corresponding the therefore the sum the gibbs energies the reactants must the equal the sum the gibbs energies the where this case partial molar gibbs chemical potential the chemical potential reagent function the activity that standard chemical potential substituting expressions like this into the gibbs energy equation closed system now stoichiometric coefficient differential constant pressure and temperature gibbs free energy change for the reaction this results substituting the chemical the relationship standard gibbs energy change for the reaction reaction quotient therefore equilibrium equilibrium constant leading and obtaining the value the standard gibbs energy allows the calculation the equilibrium constant addition reactants products for reactional system and then activity reagent increases the reaction quotient and the reaction will shift the right the forward and thus more products will activity product increases and the reaction will shift the left the reverse and thus less products will note that activities and equilibrium constants are dimensionless treatment activity the expression for the equilibrium constant can rewritten the product concentration and activity coefficient quotient the concentration reagent etc possible principle obtain values the activity for equations such the debye ckel equation extensions such davies equation specific ion interaction theory pitzer equations may software however this not always common practice assume that and use the concentration quotient place the thermodynamic equilibrium also general practice use the term equilibrium constant instead the more accurate concentration quotient this practice will followed for reactions the gas phase partial pressure used place concentration and fugacity coefficient place activity the real for when making ammonia fugacity coefficients must taken into fugacity the product partial pressure and fugacity the chemical potential species the gas phase given the general expression defining equilibrium constant valid for both solution and gas concentration quotients aqueous equilibrium constants are usually determined the presence inert electrolyte such sodium nitrate nano potassium perchlorate kclo the ionic strength solution given where and stands for the concentration and ionic charge ion type and the sum taken over all the types charged species when the concentration dissolved salt much higher than the analytical concentrations the the ions originating from the dissolved salt determine the ionic and the ionic strength effectively since activity coefficients depend ionic strength the activity coefficients the species are effectively independent thus the assumption that constant the concentration quotient simple multiple the equilibrium however will vary with ionic measured series different ionic strengths the value can extrapolated zero ionic the concentration quotient obtained this manner paradoxically thermodynamic equilibrium use published value equilibrium constant conditions ionic strength different from the conditions used its the value should adjusted software metastable mixtures mixture may appear have tendency though not for mixture and metastable there kinetic barrier formation the the barrier can overcome when catalyst also present the mixture the contact process but the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium likewise the formation bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water very slow under normal conditions but almost instantaneous the presence the catalytic enzyme carbonic anhydrase pure substances when pure substances liquids are involved equilibria their activities not appear the equilibrium constant because their numerical values are considered applying the general formula for equilibrium constant the specific case acetic acid one obtains may assumed that the concentration water this assumption will valid for all but very concentrated the equilibrium constant expression therefore usually written where now constant factor incorporated into the equilibrium particular case the self ionization water itself the ionization constant water defined perfectly legitimate write for the hydronium ion concentration since the state solvation the proton constant dilute and does not affect the equilibrium varies with variation ionic strength the concentrations and are not independent most commonly replaced equilibrium constant expressions which would otherwise include hydroxide ion solids also not appear the equilibrium constant they are considered pure and thus their activities taken example the boudouard reaction for which the equation without solid written multiple equilibria consider the case dibasic acid when dissolved the mixture will contain and this equilibrium can split into two steps each which one proton and are examples stepwise equilibrium the overall equilibrium product the stepwise note that these constants are dissociation constants because the products the right hand side the equilibrium expression are dissociation many preferable use association and are examples association clearly and and for multiple equilibrium also theory response reactions effect temperature the effect changing temperature equilibrium constant given the van hoff equation for exothermic reactions decreases with increase but for endothermic reactions increases with increase alternative formulation first sight this appears offer means obtaining the standard molar enthalpy the reaction studying the variation with however the method unreliable because error propagation almost always

adduct the composition there are any number ways that the composition mixture can for see ice table for traditional method calculating the solution weak there are three approaches the general calculation the composition mixture the most basic approach manipulate the various equilibrium constants until the desired concentrations are expressed terms measured equilibrium constants equivalent measuring chemical and initial minimize the gibbs energy the satisfy the equation mass balance the equations mass balance are simply statements that demonstrate that the total concentration each reactant must constant the law conservation mass mass balance equations the calculations are rather complicated for the case dibasic dissolved water the two reactants can specified the conjugate base and the proton the following equations balance could apply equally well base such diaminoethane which case the base itself designated the reactant with the total concentration species note that customary omit the ionic charges when writing and using these when the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations two unknown free and this follows from the fact that and the concentrations the complexes are calculated from the free concentrations and the equilibrium general expressions applicable all systems with two and would easy see how this can extended three more polybasic acids the composition solutions containing reactants and easy calculate function when the free concentration calculated from the balance equation here example the results that can this for the hydrolysis the aluminium lewis acid shows the species concentrations for solution aluminium salt function each concentration shown percentage the total solution and precipitation the diagram above illustrates the point that precipitate that not one the main species the solution equilibrium may just below the main species present solution are aluminium hydroxides and but raising the precipitates from the this occurs because has very large lattice energy the rises more and more comes out this example principle increasing the concentration the hydroxide ion causes more aluminium hydroxide which removes hydroxide from the when the hydroxide concentration becomes sufficiently high the soluble another common instance where precipitation occurs when metal cation interacts with anionic ligand form electrically neutral the complex hydrophobic will precipitate out this occurs with the nickel ion and dimethylglyoxime dmgh this case the lattice energy the solid not particularly but greatly exceeds the energy solvation the molecule minimization free energy for closed particles may enter although they may combine various the total
