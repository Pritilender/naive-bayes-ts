category chemical kinetics also known reaction kinetics the study rates chemical chemical kinetics includes investigations how different experimental conditions can influence the speed chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction mechanism and transition states well the construction mathematical models that can describe the characteristics chemical peter waage and cato guldberg pioneered the development chemical kinetics formulating the law mass action which states that the speed chemical reaction proportional the quantity the reacting chemical kinetics deals with the experimental determination reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions for which reaction rates are independent first order reactions and second order reactions and can derived for consecutive the rate determining step often determines the consecutive order steady state approximation can simplify the rate law the activation energy for reaction experimentally determined through the arrhenius equation and the eyring equation the main factors that influence the reaction rate include the physical state the the concentrations the the temperature which the reaction and whether not any catalysts are present the contents factors affecting reaction rate nature the reactants physical state concentration temperature catalysts pressure equilibrium free energy applications see also references external links factors affecting reaction rate nature the reactants depending upon what substances are the reaction rate acid base the formation salts and ion exchange are fast when covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large molecules are the reactions tend very nature and strength bonds reactant molecules greatly influence the rate its transformation into physical state the physical state solid liquid gas reactant also important factor the rate when reactants are the same phase aqueous solution thermal motion brings them into however when they are different the reaction limited the interface between the reaction can occur only their area the case liquid and the surface the vigorous shaking and stirring may needed bring the reaction this means that the more finely divided solid liquid reactant the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact makes with the other thus the faster the make for when one starts one uses wood chips and small branches one does not start with large logs right organic water reactions are the exception the rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous concentration the reactions are due collisions reactant the frequency with which the molecules ions collide depends upon their concentrations the more crowded the molecules the more likely they are collide and react with one thus increase the concentrations the reactants will result the corresponding increase the reaction while decrease the concentrations will have reverse for combustion that occurs air oxygen will occur more rapidly pure temperature temperature usually has major effect the rate chemical molecules higher temperature have more thermal energy although collision frequency greater higher this alone contributes only very small proportion the increase rate much more important the fact that the proportion reactant molecules with sufficient energy react energy greater than activation energy significantly higher and explained detail the maxwell boltzmann distribution molecular the rule that the rate chemical reactions doubles for every temperature rise common this may have been generalized from the special case biological where the temperature often between and kinetics can also studied with temperature jump approach this involves using sharp rise temperature and observing the relaxation time the return particularly useful form temperature jump apparatus shock tube which can rapidly jump temperature more than degrees catalysts catalyst substance that accelerates the rate chemical reaction but remains chemically unchanged the catalyst increases rate reaction providing different reaction mechanism occur with lower activation energy autocatalysis reaction product itself catalyst for that reaction leading positive feedback proteins that act catalysts biochemical reactions are called enzymes michaelis menten kinetics describe the rate enzyme mediated reactions catalyst does not affect the position the the catalyst speeds the backward and forward reactions certain organic specific substituents can have influence reaction rate neighbouring group participation agitating mixing solution will also accelerate the rate chemical this gives the particles greater kinetic increasing the number collisions between reactants therefore the possibility successful pressure increasing the pressure gaseous reaction will increase the number collisions between increasing the rate this because the activity gas directly proportional the partial pressure the this similar the effect increasing the concentration addition this straightforward action the rate coefficients themselves can change due the rate coefficients and products many temperature phase reactions change inert gas added the variations this effect are called fall off and chemical activation these phenomena are due exothermic endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat causing the reacting molecules have thermal energy distributions boltzmann distribution increasing the pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules and the rest the reducing this condensed phase rate coefficients can also affected very pressure this completely different effect than off often studied using diamond anvils kinetics can also studied with pressure jump approach this involves making fast changes pressure and observing the relaxation time the return equilibrium while chemical kinetics concerned with the rate chemical thermodynamics determines the extent which reactions reversible reaction chemical equilibrium reached when the rates the forward and reverse reactions are equal the principle detailed balance and the concentrations the reactants and products longer this demonstrated for the haber bosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen produce chemical clock reactions such the belousov zhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate for long time before finally attaining the free energy general the free energy change reaction determines whether chemical change will take but kinetics describes how fast the reaction reaction can very exothermic and have very positive entropy change but will not happen practice the reaction too reactant can produce two different the thermodynamically most stable one will general except special circumstances when the reaction said under kinetic reaction control the curtin hammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting each going different possible make predictions about reaction rate constants for reaction from free energy relationships the kinetic isotope effect the difference the rate chemical reaction when atom one the reactants replaced one its isotopes chemical kinetics provides information residence time and heat transfer chemical reactor chemical engineering and the molar mass distribution polymer chemistry applications the mathematical models that describe chemical reaction kinetics provide chemists and chemical engineers with tools better understand and describe chemical processes such food microorganism stratospheric ozone and the complex chemistry biological these models can also used the design modification chemical reactors optimize product more efficiently separate and eliminate environmentally harmful when performing catalytic cracking heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light for
