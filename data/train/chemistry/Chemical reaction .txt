lavoisier chemical reactions such combustion the fermentation and the reduction ores metals were known since initial theories transformation materials were developed greek such the four element theory empedocles stating that any substance composed the four basic elements fire water air and the middle chemical transformations were studied alchemists they convert lead into gold for which purpose they used reactions lead and copper alloys with sulfur the production chemical substances that not normally occur nature has long been such the synthesis sulfuric and nitric acids attributed the controversial alchemist bir ibn the process involved heating sulfate and nitrate minerals such copper sulfate alum and saltpeter the johann rudolph glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride with the development the lead chamber process and the leblanc process allowing scale production sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate respectively chemical reactions became implemented into the further optimization sulfuric acid technology resulted the contact process and the haber process was developed for ammonia synthesis from the researchers including jan baptist van helmont robert boyle and isaac newton tried establish theories the experimentally observed chemical the phlogiston theory was proposed johann joachim becher postulated the existence like element called phlogiston which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion this proved false antoine lavoisier who found the correct explanation the combustion reaction with oxygen from the joseph louis lussac recognized that gases always react certain relationship with each based this idea and the atomic theory john dalton joseph proust had developed the law definite proportions which later resulted the concepts stoichiometry and chemical equations regarding the organic chemistry was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex obtained synthetically according the concept vitalism organic matter was endowed with vital and distinguished from inorganic this separation was ended however the synthesis urea from inorganic precursors friedrich hler other chemists who brought major contributions organic chemistry include alexander william williamson with his synthesis ethers and christopher kelk ingold who among many established the mechanisms substitution reactions equations oxygen water chemical equation chemical equations are used graphically illustrate chemical they consist chemical structural formulas the reactants the left and those the products the they are separated arrow which indicates the direction and type the the arrow read the word yields the tip the arrow points the direction which the reaction double arrow pointing opposite directions used for equilibrium reactions equations should balanced according the stoichiometry the number atoms each species should the same both sides the this achieved scaling the number involved molecules and schematic example the appropriate integers and more elaborate reactions are represented reaction which addition starting materials and products show important intermediates transition states also some relatively minor additions the reaction can indicated above the reaction examples such additions are heat illumination etc similarly some minor products can placed below the often with minus oxidation ketones esters peroxycarboxylic acid retrosynthetic analysis can applied design complex synthesis here the analysis starts from the for example splitting selected chemical arrive plausible initial special arrow used retro elementary reactions the elementary reaction the smallest division into which chemical reaction can decomposed has intermediate most experimentally observed reactions are built from many elementary reactions that occur parallel the actual sequence the individual elementary reactions known reaction mechanism elementary reaction involves few usually one because the low probability for several molecules meet certain azobenzene the most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular only one molecule involved unimolecular transformed isomerization dissociation into one more other such reactions require the addition energy the form heat typical example unimolecular reaction the cis trans isomerization which the form compound converts the form vice typical dissociation reaction bond molecule splits ruptures resulting two molecular the splitting can homolytic heterolytic the first the bond divided that each product retains electron and becomes neutral radical the second both electrons the chemical bond remain with one the resulting charged ions dissociation plays important role triggering chain reactions such hydrogen oxygen polymerization reactions for bimolecular two molecules collide and react with each their merger called chemical synthesis addition reaction another possibility that only portion one molecule transferred the other this type reaction for redox and base redox the transferred particle whereas base reactions this type reaction also called metathesis for example chemical equilibrium chemical equilibrium most chemical reactions are that they can and run both the forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ reaction rates these rates depend the concentration and therefore change with time the the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal the rate the forward establishing the called chemical the time reach equilibrium depends such parameters pressure and the materials and determined the minimum free energy the gibbs free energy must the pressure dependence can explained with the principle for increase pressure due decreasing volume causes the reaction shift the side with the fewer moles the reaction yield stabilizes but can increased removing the product from the reaction mixture changed increasing the temperature change the concentrations the reactants does not affect the equilibrium but does affect the equilibrium thermodynamics chemical reactions are determined the laws thermodynamics reactions can proceed themselves they are exergonic that they release the associated free energy the reaction composed two different thermodynamic enthalpy and entropy reactions can exothermic where negative and energy typical examples exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous liquid endothermic reactions heat consumed from the this can occur increasing the entropy the often through the formation gaseous reaction which have high since the entropy increases with many endothermic reactions preferably take place high the many exothermic reactions such crystallization occur low changes temperature can sometimes reverse the sign the enthalpy for the carbon monoxide reduction molybdenum dioxide this reaction form carbon dioxide and molybdenum endothermic low becoming less with increasing zero and the reaction becomes exothermic above that changes temperature can also reverse the direction tendency for the water gas shift reaction favored low but its reverse favored high the shift reaction direction tendency occurs reactions can also characterized the internal energy which takes into account changes the volume and chemical potential the latter among other the activities the involved small change sign kinetics the speed which reactions takes place studied reaction kinetics the rate depends various such reactant concentrations which usually make the reaction happen faster rate raised through increased collisions per unit some however have rates that are independent reactant these are called zero order reactions surface area available for contact between the particular solid ones heterogeneous larger surface areas lead higher reaction pressure increasing the pressure decreases the volume between molecules and therefore increases the frequency collisions between the activation energy which defined the amount energy required make the reaction start and carry higher activation energy implies that the reactants need more energy start than reaction with lower activation temperature which hastens reactions since higher temperature increases the energy the creating more collisions per unit the presence absence catalyst catalysts are substances which change the pathway reaction which turn increases the speed reaction lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction take catalyst not destroyed changed during can used for some the presence electromagnetic radiation most notably ultraviolet light needed promote the breaking bonds start the this particularly true for reactions involving radicals several theories allow calculating the reaction rates the molecular this field referred reaction the rate first order reaction which could disintegration substance given its integration here order rate constant having dimension concentration time and the initial the rate order reaction depends only the concentration and the properties the involved and the reaction itself can described with the characteristic half life more than one time constant needed when describing reactions higher the temperature dependence the rate constant usually follows the arrhenius equation where the activation energy and the boltzmann constant one the simplest models reaction rate the collision theory more realistic models are tailored specific problem and include the transition state theory the calculation the potential energy surface the marcus theory and the rice marcus theory reaction types four basic types synthesis synthesis reaction synthesis two more simple substances combine form more complex these reactions are the general two more reactants yielding one product another way identify synthesis one example synthesis reaction the combination iron and sulfur form iron sulfide another example simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas produce more complex such decomposition decomposition reaction decomposition reaction the opposite synthesis where more complex substance breaks down into its more simple these reactions are the general one example decomposition reaction the electrolysis water make oxygen and hydrogen gas single replacement single replacement reaction single uncombined element replaces another order one element trades places with another element compound these reactions come the general form one example single displacement reaction when magnesium replaces hydrogen water make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen double replacement double replacement reaction the anions and cations two compounds switch places and form two entirely different these reactions are the general for when barium chloride bacl and magnesium sulfate mgso react the anion switches places with the anion giving the compounds baso and mgcl another example double displacement reaction the reaction lead nitrate with potassium iodide form lead iodide and potassium nitrate oxidation and reduction sodium chloride redox reactions can understood terms transfer electrons from one involved species reducing agent another oxidizing agent this the former species oxidized and the latter reduced though sufficient for many these descriptions are not precisely oxidation better defined increase oxidation state and reduction decrease oxidation the transfer electrons will always change the oxidation but there are many reactions that are classed redox even though electron transfer occurs such those involving covalent bonds the following redox hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas form the ionic compound sodium chloride common table the sodium metal goes from oxidation state pure other the sodium lost one electron and said have been the other the chlorine gas goes from oxidation also pure the chlorine gains one electron and said have been because the chlorine the one considered the electron other induces oxidation the sodium thus the chlorine gas considered the oxidizing conversely the sodium oxidized the electron and thus induces reduction the other species and considered the reducing agent which the involved reactants would reducing oxidizing agent can predicted from the electronegativity their elements with low such most easily donate electrons and oxidize they are reducing the many ions with high oxidation such mno cro oso can gain one two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing the number electrons donated accepted redox reaction can predicted from the electron configuration the reactant elements try reach the energy noble gas configuration and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron noble gases themselves are chemically important class redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions where electrons from the power supply are used the reducing these reactions are particularly important for the production chemical such chlorine aluminium the reverse process which electrons are released redox reactions and can used electrical energy possible and used complexation ferrocene ligands complexation several ligands react with metal atom form coordination complex this achieved providing lone pairs the ligand into empty orbitals the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds the ligands are lewis bases they can both ions and neutral such carbon ammonia the number ligands that react with central metal atom can found using the electron rule saying that the valence shells transition metal will collectively accommodate electrons whereas the symmetry the resulting complex can predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory complexation reactions also include ligand exchange which one more ligands are replaced and redox processes which change the oxidation state the central metal acid base reactions the lowry base theory acid base reaction involves transfer protons from one species the acid another the base when proton removed from the resulting species termed that conjugate base when the proton accepted the resulting species termed that conjugate acid other acids act proton donors and bases act proton acceptors according the following the reverse reaction and thus the base and conjugated acid are always the equilibrium determined the acid and base dissociation constants and the involved special case the base reaction the neutralization where acid and taken exactly same form neutral salt acid base reactions can have different definitions depending the base concept some the most common arrhenius definition acids dissociate water releasing ions bases dissociate water releasing ions lowry definition acids are proton donors bases are proton this includes the arrhenius lewis definition acids are pair bases are pair this includes the lowry precipitation precipitation the formation solid solution inside another solid during chemical usually takes place when the concentration dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms insoluble this process can assisted adding precipitating agent removal the rapid precipitation results amorphous microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals the latter can also obtained recrystallization from microcrystalline solid state reactions reactions can take place between two however because the relatively small diffusion rates the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow comparison liquid and gas phase they are accelerated increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant increase the contacting surface photochemical reactions chi reaction olefin oxetane photochemical reactions atoms and molecules absorb energy photons the illumination light and convert into excited state they can then release this energy breaking chemical thereby producing photochemical reactions include oxygen radical polymerization chain reactions and rearrangement reactions many important processes involve the premier example photosynthesis which most plants use solar energy convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose disposing oxygen humans rely photochemistry for the formation vitamin and vision initiated photochemical reaction rhodopsin fireflies enzyme the abdomen catalyzes reaction that results bioluminescence many significant photochemical such ozone occur the earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry catalysis reaction progress kinetic analysis catalytic converters peugeot catalysis the reaction does not proceed but through third substance known catalyst unlike other reagents that participate the chemical catalyst not consumed the reaction however can deactivated destroyed secondary catalysts can used different phase heterogeneous the same phase homogeneous the heterogeneous typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered polymeric side additionally heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution liquid system evaporate gas catalysts can only speed the reaction chemicals that slow down the reaction are called substances that increase the activity catalysts are called and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic with reaction which kinetically inhibited high activation energy can take place circumvention this activation heterogeneous catalysts are usually powdered order maximize their surface particular importance heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition which are used hydrogenations catalytic reforming and the synthesis commodity chemicals such nitric acid and ammonia acids are example homogeneous they increase the nucleophilicity carbonyls allowing reaction that would not otherwise proceed with the advantage homogeneous catalysts the ease mixing them with the but they may also difficult separate from the therefore heterogeneous catalysts are preferred many industrial reactions organic chemistry organic addition reduction base number other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms carbon and heteroatoms such nitrogen halogens etc many specific reactions organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their substitution substitution reaction functional group particular chemical compound replaced another these reactions can distinguished the type substituting species into nucleophilic electrophilic radical substitution the first nucleophile atom molecule with excess electrons and thus negative charge partial charge replaces another atom part the substrate molecule the electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming new while the leaving group departs with electron the nucleophile may electrically neutral negatively whereas the substrate typically neutral positively examples nucleophiles are hydroxide ion alkoxides amines and halides this type reaction found mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons and rarely aromatic hydrocarbon the latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups nucleophilic substitution can take place two different and their stands for for and the number represents the kinetic order the unimolecular reaction the reaction proceeds two first the leaving group eliminated creating carbocation this followed rapid reaction with the the mechanism the nucleophile forms transition state with the attacked and only then the leaving group these two mechanisms differ the stereochemistry the leads the stereospecific addition and does not result chiral but rather set geometric isomers cis trans reversal walden inversion the previously existing stereochemistry observed the mechanism electrophilic substitution the counterpart the nucleophilic substitution that the attacking atom electrophile has low electron density and thus positive typical electrophiles are the carbon atom carbonyl groups carbocations sulfur nitronium cations this reaction takes place almost exclusively aromatic where called electrophilic aromatic substitution the electrophile attack results the called transition state which the aromatic system then the leaving usually split off and the aromaticity alternative aromatic substitution electrophilic aliphatic similar the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major and the third type substitution radical the attacking particle radical this process usually takes the form chain reaction for example the reaction alkanes with the first light heat disintegrates the containing molecules producing the then the reaction proceeds avalanche until two radicals meet and addition and elimination the addition and its the elimination are reactions which change the number substitutents the carbon and form cleave multiple bonds double and triple bonds can produced eliminating suitable leaving similar the nucleophilic there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction the mechanism the leaving group ejected forming the next formation the double takes place with elimination proton deprotonation the leaving order reversed the that the proton split off this mechanism requires participation because the similar both reactions the elimination always compete with the substitution the mechanism also requires but there the attack the base and the elimination the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce ionic contrast the eliminations different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product the mechanism because the attack the base preferentially occurs the position with respect the leaving because the similar conditions and the elimination always competition with the the counterpart elimination the addition where double triple bonds are converted into single similar the substitution there are several types additions distinguished the type the attacking for the electrophilic addition hydrogen electrophile attacks the double bond forming carbocation which then reacts with the nucleophile the carbocation can formed either side the double bond depending the groups attached its and the preferred configuration can predicted with the markovnikov rule this rule states that the heterolytic addition polar molecule alkene the more electronegative atom the polar molecule becomes attached the carbon atom bearing the smaller number hydrogen the addition functional group takes place the less substituted carbon atom the double then the electrophilic substitution with acids not this one has use the hydroboration oxidation reaction where the first the boron atom acts electrophile and adds the less substituted carbon the second the nucleophilic hydroperoxide halogen anion attacks the boron while the addition the rich alkenes and alkynes mainly the nucleophilic addition plays important role for the heteroatom multiple and especially its most important the carbonyl this process often associated with that after the reaction the carbonyl group present therefore called elimination reaction and may occur carboxylic acid derivatives such esters this reaction often catalyzed acids where the acids increase the electrophilicity the carbonyl group binding the oxygen whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity the attacking nucleophilic addition carbanion another nucleophile the double bond alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the michael reaction which belongs the larger class conjugate additions this one the most useful methods for the mild formation some additions which can not executed with nucleophiles and can succeeded with free with the radical the radical addition proceeds chain and such reactions are the basis the free radical polymerization other organic reaction mechanisms rearrangement reaction the carbon skeleton molecule rearranged give structural isomer the original these include hydride shift reactions such the wagner meerwein rearrangement where hydrogen alkyl aryl group migrates from one carbon neighboring most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation new carbon other examples are sigmatropic reaction such the cope rearrangement cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and more pericyclic reactions wherein two more double containing molecules form cyclic important example cycloaddition reaction the diels alder reaction the called cycloaddition between conjugated diene and substituted alkene form substituted cyclohexene system whether not certain cycloaddition would proceed depends the electronic orbitals the participating only orbitals with the same sign wave function will overlap and interact constructively form new cycloaddition usually assisted light these perturbations result different arrangement electrons the excited state the involved molecules and therefore different for the diels alder reactions can assisted heat whereas the cycloaddition selectively induced because the orbital the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition described the woodward hoffmann rules biochemical reactions biochemical reactions are mainly controlled enzymes these proteins can specifically catalyze single that reactions can controlled very the reaction takes place the active site small part the enzyme which usually found cleft pocket lined amino acid residues and the rest the enzyme used mainly for the catalytic action enzymes relies several mechanisms including the molecular shape induced bond proximity and orientation molecules relative the proton donation withdrawal base electrostatic interactions and many the biochemical reactions that occur living organisms are collectively known metabolism among the most important its mechanisms the anabolism which different dna and controlled processes result the production large molecules such proteins and carbohydrates from smaller bioenergetics studies the sources energy for such important energy source glucose which can produced plants via photosynthesis assimilated from all organisms use this energy produce adenosine triphosphate which can then used energize other applications chemical reactions are central chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis new compounds from natural raw materials such petroleum and mineral ores essential make the reaction efficient maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount energy inputs and catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate some specific reactions have their niche for the thermite reaction used generate light and heat pyrotechnics and welding although less controllable than the more conventional oxy fuel welding arc welding and flash welding requires much less equipment and still used mend especially remote monitoring mechanisms monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly the reaction relatively slow processes can analyzed situ for the concentrations and identities the individual important tools real time analysis are the measurement and analysis optical absorption and emission less accessible but rather efficient method introduction radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how changes over time and where moves this method often used analyze redistribution substances the human faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization
