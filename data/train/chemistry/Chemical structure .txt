chemical structure navigation search chemical structure includes molecular geometry electronic structure and crystal structure molecules molecular geometry refers the spatial arrangement atoms molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms molecular geometry can range from the very such diatomic oxygen nitrogen molecules the very such protein dna molecules molecular geometry can roughly represented using structural formula electronic structure describes the occupation molecular orbitals the theory chemical structure was first developed aleksandr butlerov which stated that the chemical compounds are not random cluster atoms and functional groups but structures with definite order formed according the valency the composing atoms other important contributors were archibald scott couper and friedrich august kekule structure determination structural determination chemistry the process determining the chemical structure practically the end result such process the obtainment the coordinates the atoms the methods which one can determine the structure molecule include spectroscopy such nuclear magnetic resonance infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy electron microscopy and ray crystallography ray diffraction the last technique can produce dimensional models scale resolution long crystals are ray diffraction needs numerous copies the molecule being studied that must also arranged organised the following are common methods for determining the chemical structure structural elucidation ray diffraction proton nmr nmr mass spectrometry infrared spectroscopy the following are common methods for determining the electronic electron spin resonance cyclic voltammetry electron absorption spectroscopy ray photoelectron spectroscopy see also pauli exclusion principle rule five describing molecular properties drugs qsar quantitative affinity relationship chemical property molecular property physical property crystallographic database
