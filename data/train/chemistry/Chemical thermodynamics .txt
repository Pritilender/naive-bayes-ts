thermodynamics chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements various thermodynamic but also the application mathematical methods the study chemical questions and the spontaneity the structure chemical thermodynamics based the first two laws thermodynamics starting from the first and second laws four equations called the fundamental equations can from these multitude relating the thermodynamic properties the thermodynamic system can derived using relatively simple this outlines the mathematical framework chemical contents history overview chemical energy chemical reactions gibbs function chemical affinity solutions non equilibrium system constraints see also references further reading external links history willard gibbs chemical thermodynamics the german physicist rudolf clausius his mechanical theory heat suggested that the principles thermochemistry the heat evolved combustion reactions could applied the principles thermodynamics building the work between the years the american mathematical physicist willard gibbs published series three the most famous one being the paper the equilibrium heterogeneous substances these gibbs showed how the first two laws thermodynamics could measured graphically and mathematically determine both the thermodynamic equilibrium chemical reactions well their tendencies occur gibbs collection papers provided the first unified body thermodynamic theorems from the principles developed such clausius and sadi carnot during the early two major publications successfully applied the principles developed gibbs chemical and thus established the foundation the science chemical the first was the textbook thermodynamics and the free energy chemical substances gilbert lewis and merle randall this book was responsible for supplanting the chemical affinity for the term free energy the speaking the second was the book modern thermodynamics the methods willard gibbs written guggenheim this lewis randall and guggenheim are considered the founders modern chemical thermodynamics because the major contribution these two books unifying the application thermodynamics chemistry overview the primary objective chemical thermodynamics the establishment criterion for the determination the feasibility spontaneity given this chemical thermodynamics typically used predict the energy exchanges that occur the following chemical reactions phase changes the formation solutions the following state functions are primary concern chemical internal energy enthalpy entropy gibbs free energy most identities chemical thermodynamics arise from application the first and second laws particularly the law conservation energy these state the laws thermodynamics the energy the universe any spontaneous there always increase entropy the universe the entropy perfect crystal kelvin zero chemical energy chemical energy chemical energy the potential chemical substance undergo transformation through chemical reaction transform other chemical breaking making chemical bonds involves energy which may either absorbed evolved from chemical energy that can released because reaction between set chemical substances equal the difference between the energy content the products and the this change energy called the change internal energy chemical where the internal energy formation the reactant molecules that can calculated from the bond energies the various chemical bonds the molecules under consideration and the internal energy formation the product the internal energy change process equal the heat change measured under conditions constant closed rigid container such bomb calorimeter however under conditions constant reactions vessels open the the measured heat change not always equal the internal energy because volume work also releases absorbs the heat change constant pressure called the enthalpy change this case the enthalpy formation another useful term the heat combustion which the energy released due combustion reaction and often applied the study fuels food similar hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate and when its caloric content similar though not assessed the same way hydrocarbon fuel see food energy chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy chemical potential and for chemical transformation equation most often used the gibbs duhem equation chemical reactions chemical reaction most cases interest chemical thermodynamics there are internal degrees freedom and such chemical reactions and phase transitions which always create entropy unless they are are maintained running through changes being coupled constraining such pistons electrodes deliver and receive external even for homogeneous bulk materials the free energy functions depend the composition all the extensive thermodynamic potentials including the internal the quantities the number chemical species are omitted from the impossible describe compositional gibbs function for bulk system they are the last remaining extensive for homogeneous bulk system there are still various extensive compositional variables that depends which specify the the amounts each chemical substance expressed the numbers molecules present dividing avogadro number the numbers moles for the case where only work possible which the chemical potential for the component the system the expression for especially useful constant and conditions which are easy achieve experimentally and which approximates the condition living creatures chemical affinity chemical affinity while this formulation mathematically not particularly transparent since one does not simply add remove molecules from there always process involved changing the chemical reaction movement molecules from one phase another gas should find notation which does not seem imply that the amounts the components can changed all real processes obey conservation mass and conservation the numbers atoms each whatever molecules are transferred from should considered part the system consequently introduce explicit variable represent the degree advancement progress variable for the extent reaction prigogine defay prigogine guggenheim and the use the partial derivative place the widely used since the quantity issue not finite the result understandable expression for the dependence chemical reactions other there just one reaction introduce the stoichiometric coefficient for the component the reaction which tells how many molecules are produced obtain algebraic expression for the partial derivative progoine defay guggenheim introduce concise and historical name for this the affinity symbolized introduced ophile donder the minus sign comes from the fact the affinity was defined represent the rule that spontaneous changes will ensue only when the change the gibbs free energy the process meaning that the chemical species have positive affinity for each the differential for takes simple form which displays its dependence compositional change there are number chemical reactions going usually the case set reaction coordinates avoiding the notion that the amounts the components can changed the expressions above are equal zero thermodynamic equilibrium while the general case for real they are negative because all chemical reactions proceeding finite rate produce this can made even more explicit introducing the reaction rates for each and every physically independent process prigogine defay prigogine this remarkable result since the chemical potentials are intensive system depending only the local molecular they cannot know whether the temperature and pressure any other system are going held constant over purely local criterion and must hold regardless any such could have been obtained taking partial derivatives any the other fundamental state but nonetheless general criterion for times the entropy production from that spontaneous least any part that not captured external see constraints below now relax the requirement homogeneous system letting the chemical potentials and the affinity apply any locality which chemical reaction any other accounting for the entropy production due irreversible the inequality for now replaced equality any decrease the gibbs function system the upper limit for any isothermal isobaric work that can captured the surroundings may simply dissipated appearing times corresponding increase the entropy the system its may partly toward doing external work and partly toward creating the important point that the extent reaction for chemical reaction may coupled the displacement some external mechanical electrical quantity such way that one can advance only the other one also the coupling may occasionally rigid but often flexible and solutions solution chemistry and biochemistry the gibbs free energy decrease molar denoted cryptically commonly used surrogate for times the entropy produced spontaneous chemical reactions situations where there work being least useful work other than perhaps some the assertion that all spontaneous reactions have negative merely restatement the fundamental thermodynamic relation giving the physical dimensions energy and somewhat obscuring its significance terms when there useful work being would less misleading use the legendre transforms the entropy appropriate for constant for constant and the massieu functions and respectively non equilibrium non equilibrium thermodynamics generally the systems treated with the conventional chemical thermodynamics are either equilibrium near ilya prigogine developed the thermodynamic treatment open systems that are far from doing has discovered phenomena and structures completely new and completely unexpected his nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has found surprising applications wide variety the non equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how ordered structures the biological can develop from even relations are the classical principles equilibrium thermodynamics still show that linear systems close equilibrium always develop into states disorder which are stable perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence ordered prigogine called these systems dissipative systems because they are formed and maintained the dissipative processes which take place because the exchange energy between the system and its environment and because they disappear that exchange they may said live symbiosis with their the method which prigogine used study the stability the dissipative structures perturbations very great general makes possible study the most varied such city traffic the stability insect the development ordered biological structures and the growth cancer cells mention but few system constraints this crucial understand the role walls and other constraints and the distinction between independent processes and coupling contrary the clear implications many reference the previous analysis not restricted homogeneous isotropic bulk systems which can deliver only work the outside but applies even the most structured there are complex systems with many chemical reactions going the same some which are really only parts the overall independent process one that could proceed even all others were unaccountably stopped their understanding this perhaps thought experiment chemical kinetics but actual examples gas reaction which results increase the number molecules will lead increase volume constant external occurs inside cylinder closed with the equilibrated reaction can proceed only doing work against external force the the extent variable for the reaction can increase only the piston and the piston pushed the reaction driven similarly redox reaction might occur electrochemical cell with the passage current wires connecting the electrodes the cell reactions the electrodes are constrained current allowed the current might dissipated joule heating might turn run electrical device like motor doing mechanical work automobile lead acid battery can driving the chemical reaction this case the reaction not independent some perhaps the gibbs free energy reaction may delivered external the hydrolysis atp adp and phosphate can drive the force times distance work delivered living muscles and synthesis atp turn driven redox chain mitochondria and chloroplasts which involves the transport ions across the membranes these cellular organelles the coupling processes and the previous often not gas can leak slowly past just can slowly leak out rubber balloon some reaction may occur battery even external current there usually coupling coefficient which may depend relative which determines what percentage the driving free energy turned into external captured
