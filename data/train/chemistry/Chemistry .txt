the structure properties and change matter chemistry chiefly concerned with atoms and molecules and their interactions and for the properties the chemical bonds formed between atoms create chemical compounds chemistry studies the involvement electrons and various forms energy photochemical reactions oxidation reduction reactions changes phases matter and separation mixtures preparation and properties complex such alloys polymers biological and pharmaceutical agents are considered specialized fields chemistry sometimes called the central science because bridges other natural sciences like physics geology and biology chemistry branch physical science but distinct from physics the etymology the word chemistry has been much the history chemistry can traced certain known alchemy which had been practiced for several millennia various parts the particularly the middle contents etymology definition history chemistry science chemical structure principles modern chemistry matter atom element compound molecule substance and mixture mole and amount substance phase bonding energy reaction ions and salts acidity and basicity redox equilibrium chemical laws practice subdisciplines chemical industry professional societies see also references bibliography further reading etymology history outline index glossary category portal the word chemistry comes from the word alchemy earlier set practices that encompassed elements metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism and commonly thought the quest turn lead another common starting material into alchemy which was practiced around the study the composition movement growth embodying disembodying drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies zosimos alchemist was called popular and later the suffix was added this describe the art the chemist chemistry the word alchemy turn derived from the arabic word the term borrowed from the greek this may have egyptian origins many believe that derived from the greek which turn derived from the word chemi kimi which the ancient name egypt egyptian alternately may derived from meaning cast definition the definition chemistry has changed over new discoveries and theories add the functionality the the term chymistry the view noted scientist robert boyle meant the subject the material principles mixed chymistry meant scientific which one learns dissolve and draw from them the different substances their and how unite them and exalt them higher perfection this definition was used chemist christopher glaser the definition the word chemistry used georg ernst stahl meant the art resolving compound aggregate bodies into their and composing such bodies from those jean baptiste dumas considered the word chemistry refer the science concerned with the laws and effects molecular this definition further evolved came mean the science their their and the reactions that change them into other substances characterization accepted linus pauling more the definition chemistry was broadened mean the study matter and the changes phrased professor raymond chang history history chemistry alchemy timeline chemistry democritus epicurus early such the egyptians and babylonians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts pottery and but develop systematic basic chemical hypothesis first emerged classical greece with the theory four elements propounded definitively aristotle stating that that fire air earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything formed greek atomism dates back arising works philosophers such democritus and epicurus the roman philosopher lucretius expanded upon the theory his book rerum natura the nature unlike modern concepts greek atomism was purely philosophical with little concern for empirical observations and concern for chemical the hellenistic world the art alchemy first mingling magic and occultism into the study natural substances with the ultimate goal transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir eternal alchemy was discovered and practised widely throughout the arab world after the muslim conquests and from diffused into medieval and renaissance europe through latin chemistry science under the influence the new empirical methods propounded sir francis bacon and group chemists oxford robert boyle robert hooke and john mayow began reshape the old alchemical traditions into scientific boyle particular regarded the founding father chemistry due his most important the classic chemistry text the sceptical chymist where the differentiation made between the claims alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries the new formulated boyle law rejected the classical four and proposed mechanistic alternative atoms and chemical reactions that could subject rigorous antoine laurent lavoisier the theory phlogiston substance the root all was propounded the german georg ernst stahl the early century and was only overturned the end the century the french chemist antoine lavoisier the chemical analogue newton who did more than any other establish the new science proper theoretical elucidating the principle conservation mass and developing new system chemical nomenclature used this prior his though many important discoveries had been specifically relating the nature which was discovered composed many different the scottish chemist joseph black the first experimental and the dutchman van helmont discovered carbon dioxide what black called fixed henry cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and joseph priestley and independently carl wilhelm scheele isolated pure oxygen english scientist john dalton proposed the modern theory atoms that all substances are composed indivisible matter and that different atoms have varying atomic the development the electrochemical theory chemical combinations occurred the early century the result the work two scientists berzelius and humphry davy made possible the prior invention the voltaic pile alessandro volta davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals extracting them from their oxides with electric british william prout first proposed ordering all the elements their atomic weight all atoms had weight that was exact multiple the atomic weight newlands devised early table which was then developed into the modern periodic table elements the german julius lothar meyer and the russian dmitri mendeleev the the inert later called the noble gases were discovered william ramsay collaboration with lord rayleigh the end the thereby filling the basic structure the organic chemistry was developed justus von liebig and following friedrich hler synthesis urea which proved that living organisms reducible other crucial century advances understanding valence bonding edward frankland and the application thermodynamics chemistry gibbs and svante arrhenius the chemical structure alpha particles plum pudding model concentrated charge the turn the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings chemistry were finally understood due series remarkable discoveries that succeeded probing and discovering the very nature the internal structure thomson cambridge university discovered the electron and soon after the french scientist becquerel well the couple pierre and marie curie investigated the phenomenon radioactivity series pioneering scattering experiments ernest rutherford the university manchester discovered the internal structure the atom and the existence the classified and explained the different types radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles his work atomic structure was improved his the danish physicist niels bohr and henry moseley the electronic theory chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed the american scientists linus pauling and gilbert lewis the year was declared the united nations the international year was initiative the international union pure and applied and the united nations scientific and cultural organization and involves chemical academics and institutions worldwide and relied individual initiatives organize local and regional principles modern chemistry laboratory university cologne the current model atomic structure the quantum mechanical model traditional chemistry starts with the study elementary particles atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates this matter can studied liquid gas states isolation the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied chemistry are usually the result interactions between leading rearrangements the chemical bonds which hold atoms such behaviors are studied chemistry laboratory the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms laboratory glassware however glassware not central and great deal experimental well chemistry done without chemical reaction transformation some substances into one more different the basis such chemical transformation the rearrangement electrons the chemical bonds between can symbolically depicted through chemical equation which usually involves atoms the number atoms the left and the right the equation for chemical transformation equal when the transformation definition not but rather nuclear reaction radioactive decay the type chemical reactions substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany are constrained certain basic known chemical energy and entropy considerations are invariably important almost all chemical chemical substances are classified terms their structure phase well their chemical compositions they can analyzed using the tools chemical analysis spectroscopy and chromatography scientists engaged chemical research are known chemists most chemists specialize one more several concepts are essential for the study some them matter matter matter defined anything that has rest mass and volume takes and made particles the particles that make matter have rest mass well not all particles have rest such the photon matter can pure chemical substance mixture atom rutherford model the atom the basic unit consists dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded space called the electron cloud the nucleus made positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons together called nucleons while the electron cloud consists charged electrons which orbit the neutral the charged electrons balance out the positive charge the the nucleus the mass nucleon times that yet the radius atom about times that its the atom also the smallest entity that can envisaged retain the chemical properties the such electronegativity ionization potential preferred oxidation state coordination number and preferred types bonds form metallic ionic covalent element periodic table chemical element chemical element pure substance which composed single type characterized its particular number protons the nuclei its known the atomic number and represented the symbol the mass number the sum the number protons and neutrons although all the nuclei all atoms belonging one element will have the same atomic they may not necessarily have the same mass atoms element which have different mass numbers are known isotopes for all atoms with protons their nuclei are atoms the chemical element carbon but atoms carbon may have mass numbers the standard presentation the chemical elements the periodic table which orders elements atomic the periodic table arranged groups and periods the periodic table useful identifying periodic trends compound carbon dioxide chemical compound compound pure chemical substance composed more than one the properties compound bear little similarity those its the standard nomenclature compounds set the international union pure and applied chemistry organic compounds are named according the organic nomenclature system inorganic compounds are named according the inorganic nomenclature system addition the chemical abstracts service has devised method index chemical this scheme each chemical substance identifiable number known its cas registry number molecule molecule caffeine molecule the smallest indivisible portion pure chemical substance that has its unique set chemical that its potential undergo certain set chemical reactions with other however this definition only works well for substances that are composed which not true many substances see molecules are typically set atoms bound together covalent bonds such that the structure electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either bonds lone pairs thus molecules exist electrically neutral unlike when this rule giving the molecule the result sometimes named molecular ion polyatomic however the discrete and separate nature the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions present only separated such directed beam vacuum mass spectrometer charged polyatomic collections residing solids for common sulfate nitrate are generally not considered molecules skeletal model benzene the inert noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed lone atoms their smallest discrete but the other isolated chemical elements consist either molecules networks atoms bonded each other some identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such air and many organic compounds like sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals however not all substances chemical compounds consist discrete and indeed most the solid substances that make the solid mantle and core the earth are chemical compounds without these other types such ionic compounds and network solids are organized such way lack the existence identifiable molecules per instead these substances are discussed terms formula units unit cells the smallest repeating structure within the examples such substances are mineral salts such table salt solids like carbon and metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such quartz and one the main characteristics molecule its geometry often called its structure while the structure triatomic tetra atomic molecules may angular pyramidal the structure polyatomic that are constituted more than six atoms several can crucial for its chemical substance and mixture tin sulfur diamond allotrope carbon sucrose sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate chemical substance kind matter with definite composition and set properties collection substances called examples mixtures are air and citation needed mole and amount substance mole the mole unit measurement that denotes amount substance also called chemical the mole defined the number atoms found exactly kilogram carbon where the atoms are rest and their ground state the number entities per mole known the avogadro constant and determined empirically approximately mol molar concentration the amount particular substance per volume solution and commonly reported mol phase phase addition the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical chemicals can exist several for the most the chemical classifications are independent these bulk phase however some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical phase set states chemical system that have similar bulk structural over range such pressure temperature physical such density and refractive index tend fall within values characteristic the the phase matter defined the phase transition which when energy put into taken out the system goes into rearranging the structure the instead changing the bulk sometimes the distinction between phases can continuous instead having discrete this case the matter considered supercritical state when three states meet based the known triple point and since this convenient way define set the most familiar examples phases are solids liquids and gases many substances exhibit multiple solid for there are three phases solid iron gamma and that vary based temperature and principal difference between solid phases the crystal structure the another phase commonly encountered the study chemistry the aqueous phase which the state substances dissolved aqueous solution that less familiar phases include plasmas bose einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases magnetic materials while most familiar phases deal with dimensional also possible define analogs dimensional which has received attention for its relevance systems biology bonding chemical bond sodium chlorine sodium chloride atoms sticking together molecules crystals are said bonded with one chemical bond may visualized the multipole balance between the positive charges the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about more than simple attraction and the energies and distributions characterize the availability electron bond another chemical bond can covalent bond ionic bond hydrogen bond just because van der waals force each these kinds bonds ascribed some these potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together molecules crystals many simple valence bond theory the valence shell electron pair repulsion model vsepr and the concept oxidation number can used explain molecular structure and ionic bond formed when metal loses one more its becoming positively charged and the electrons are then gained the metal becoming negatively charged the two oppositely charged ions attract one and the ionic bond the electrostatic force attraction between for sodium loses one electron become cation while chlorine gains this electron become the ions are held together due electrostatic and that compound sodium chloride common table methane covalent one more pairs valence electrons are shared two the resulting electrically neutral group bonded atoms termed molecule atoms will share valence electrons such way create noble gas electron configuration eight electrons their outermost for each atoms that tend combine such way that they each have eight electrons their valence shell are said follow the octet rule however some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons their outermost shell attain this stable these atoms are said follow the duet rule and this way they are reaching the electron configuration the noble gas helium which has two electrons its outer similarly theories from classical physics can used predict many ionic with more complicated such metal complexes valence bond theory less applicable and alternative such the molecular orbital theory are generally see diagram electronic energy energy the context energy attribute substance consequence its atomic molecular aggregate structure since chemical transformation accompanied change one more these kinds invariably accompanied increase decrease energy the substances some energy transferred between the surroundings and the reactants the reaction the form heat light thus the products reaction may have more less energy than the reaction said exergonic the final state lower the energy scale than the initial the case endergonic reactions the situation the reaction said exothermic the reaction releases heat the the case endothermic reactions the reaction absorbs heat from the chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount energy barrier known the activation energy the speed chemical reaction given temperature related the activation energy the population factor that the probability molecule have energy greater than equal the given temperature this exponential dependence reaction rate temperature known the arrhenius equation the activation energy necessary for chemical reaction occur can the form light electricity mechanical force the form ultrasound related concept free energy which also incorporates entropy very useful means for predicting the feasibility reaction and determining the state equilibrium chemical chemical thermodynamics reaction feasible only the total change the gibbs free energy equal zero the chemical reaction said equilibrium there exist only limited possible states energy for atoms and these are determined the rules quantum mechanics which require quantization energy bound the molecules higher energy state are said the atoms substance excited energy state are often much more that more amenable chemical the phase substance invariably determined its energy and the energy its when the intermolecular forces substance are such that the energy the surroundings not sufficient overcome occurs more ordered phase like liquid solid the case with water liquid room temperature because its molecules are bound hydrogen bonds whereas hydrogen sulfide gas room temperature and standard its molecules are bound weaker dipole dipole interactions the transfer energy from one chemical substance another depends the size energy quanta emitted from one however heat energy often transferred more easily from almost any substance another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy thus because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy heat more easily transferred between substances relative light other forms electronic for ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation not transferred with much efficacy from one substance another thermal electrical the existence characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances useful for their identification the analysis spectral lines different kinds spectra are often used chemical spectroscopy microwave nmr esr etc spectroscopy also used identify the composition remote objects like stars and distant galaxies analyzing their radiation iron the term chemical energy often used indicate the potential chemical substance undergo transformation through chemical reaction transform other chemical reaction chemical reaction compound chemical elements when chemical substance transformed result its interaction with another substance with chemical reaction said have chemical reaction therefore concept related the substance when comes close contact with whether mixture solution exposure some form results some energy exchange between the constituents the reaction well with the system environment which may designed vessels which are often laboratory glassware chemical reactions can result the formation dissociation that molecules breaking apart form two more smaller rearrangement atoms within across chemical reactions usually involve the making breaking chemical oxidation reduction dissociation acid base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some the commonly used kinds chemical chemical reaction can symbolically depicted through chemical equation while nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind atoms both sides the equation are for nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles protons and the sequence steps which the reorganization chemical bonds may taking place the course chemical reaction called its mechanism chemical reaction can envisioned take place number each which may have different many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus envisaged during the course reaction mechanisms are proposed explain the kinetics and the relative product mix many physical chemists specialize exploring and proposing the mechanisms various chemical several empirical like the woodward hoffmann rules often come handy while proposing mechanism for chemical according the iupac gold chemical reaction process that results the interconversion chemical accordingly chemical reaction may elementary reaction stepwise reaction additional caveat that this definition includes cases where the interconversion conformers experimentally such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets molecular entities indicated this but often conceptually convenient use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities microscopic chemical ions and salts potassium chloride ion ion charged atom that has lost gained one more when atom loses electron and thus has more protons than the atom charged ion cation when atom gains electron and thus has more electrons than the atom charged ion anion cations and anions can form crystalline lattice neutral salts such the and ions forming sodium chloride examples polyatomic ions that not split during acid base reactions are hydroxide and phosphate plasma composed gaseous matter that has been completely usually through high acidity and basicity hydrogen bromide hydrobromic acid base reaction substance can often classified acid base there are several different theories which explain base the simplest arrhenius theory which states than acid substance that produces hydronium ions when dissolved and base one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved according lowry base theory acids are substances that donate positive hydrogen ion another substance chemical base the substance which receives that hydrogen third common theory lewis base theory which based the formation new chemical lewis theory explains that acid substance which capable accepting pair electrons from another substance during the process bond while base substance which can provide pair electrons form new according this the crucial things being exchanged are unreliable there are several other ways which substance may classified acid evident the history this concept acid strength commonly measured two one based the arrhenius definition which measurement the hydronium ion concentration expressed negative logarithmic scale thus solutions that have low have high hydronium ion and can said more the other based the lowry the acid dissociation constant which measures the relative ability substance act acid under the lowry definition that substances with higher are more likely donate hydrogen ions chemical reactions than those with lower values redox redox redox red reactions include all chemical reactions which atoms have their oxidation state changed either gaining electrons losing electrons substances that have the ability oxidize other substances are said oxidative and are known oxidizing agents oxidants oxidant removes electrons from another similarly substances that have the ability reduce other substances are said reductive and are known reducing agents reductants reductant transfers electrons another and thus oxidized and because donates electrons also called electron oxidation and reduction properly refer change oxidation the actual transfer electrons may never thus oxidation better defined increase oxidation number and reduction decrease oxidation equilibrium chemical equilibrium although the concept equilibrium widely used across the context arises whenever number different states the chemical composition are for mixture several chemical compounds that can react with one when substance can present more than one kind system chemical substances even though having unchanging most often not static molecules the substances continue react with one another thus giving rise dynamic equilibrium thus the concept describes the state which the parameters such chemical composition remain unchanged over chemical laws chemical law chemical reactions are governed certain which have become fundamental concepts some them avogadro law lambert law law relating pressure and charles law relating volume and fick laws diffusion law relating pressure and principle law law law conservation energy leads the important concepts equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics law conservation mass continues conserved isolated systems even modern however special relativity shows that due mass energy equivalence whenever material energy light kinetic removed from isolated some mass will lost with high energy losses result loss weighable amounts important topic nuclear chemistry law definite composition although many systems notably biomacromolecules and the ratios tend require large and are frequently represented law multiple proportions law practice subdisciplines chemistry typically divided into several major there are also several main disciplinary and more specialized fields analytical chemistry the analysis material samples gain understanding their chemical composition and structure analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods these methods may used all subdisciplines excluding purely theoretical biochemistry the study the
