chemistry	conservation mass navigation search has been suggested that this article merged with conservation energy discuss proposed since march antoine lavoisier joseph proust law definite proportions john dalton atomic theory oxygen phlogiston the law conservation mass principle mass conservation states that for any system closed all transfers matter and energy both which have the mass the system must remain constant over system mass cannot change quantity not added hence the quantity mass conserved over the law implies that mass can neither created nor although may rearranged the entities associated with may changed for example when light physical work transformed into particles that contribute the same mass the system the light work had the law implies that during any chemical reaction nuclear reaction radioactive decay isolated the total mass the reactants starting materials must equal the mass the the concept mass conservation widely used many fields such chemistry mechanics and fluid dynamics historically mass conservation was discovered chemical reactions antoine lavoisier the late and was crucial importance the progress from alchemy the modern natural science chemistry the closely related concept matter conservation was found hold good chemistry such high approximation that failed only for the high energies treated the later refinements relativity but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical even modern special relativity needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes since conservation mass strictly and perfectly upheld only for called isolated those completely isolated from all exchanges with the this the mass energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation equivalent total energy which the first law thermodynamics for thermodynamically closed system one which closed exchanges but open exchanges material such heat and with the mass only approximately the input output material energy must change the mass the system relativity although the change usually since relatively large amounts such energy comparison with ordinary carry only small amount mass again ordinary standards special mass not converted since mass and energy cannot and energy all its forms always retains its equivalent amount mass throughout any transformation different type energy within system translocation into out certain types matter different may created but all these the energy and mass associated with such matter remains unchanged quantity although type energy associated with the matter may change general relativity mass and conservation expanding volumes space complex subject different and neither mass nor energy strictly and simply conserved the case special relativity and minkowski space for see mass general relativity contents history mass conservation chemistry generalization the mass associated with chemical amounts energy too small measure mass conservation remains correct energy not lost exceptions caveats matter conservation matter not perfectly conserved open systems and thermodynamically closed systems general relativity see also references history important idea ancient greek philosophy was that nothing comes from nothing that what exists now has always new matter can come into existence where there was none explicit statement along with the further principle that nothing can pass away into found empedocles bce for impossible for anything come from what and cannot brought about heard that what should utterly further principle conservation was stated epicurus bce who describing the nature the wrote that the totality things was always such and always will jain philosophy non creationist philosophy based the teachings mahavira century states that the universe and its constituents such matter cannot destroyed the jain text tattvarthasutra century states that substance but its modes are characterised creation and principle the conservation matter was also stated nas wrote that body matter cannot disappear only changes its condition composition color and other properties and turns into different complex elementary mass conservation chemistry the principle conservation mass was first outlined mikhail lomonosov proved though this sometimes antoine lavoisier had expressed these ideas others whose ideas dated the work lavoisier include joseph black henry cavendish and jean rey the conservation mass was obscure for millennia because the buoyancy effect the atmosphere the weight for piece wood weighs less after this seemed suggest that some its mass transformed this was not disproved until careful experiments were performed which chemical reactions such rusting were allowed take place sealed glass was found that the chemical reaction did not change the weight the sealed container and its the vacuum pump also enabled the weighing gases using once the conservation mass was great importance progressing from alchemy modern once early chemists realized that chemical substances never disappeared but were only transformed into other substances with the same these scientists could for the first time embark quantitative studies the transformations the idea mass conservation plus surmise that certain elemental also could not transformed into others chemical turn led understanding chemical elements well the idea that all chemical processes and transformations such burning and metabolic are reactions between invariant amounts weights these chemical following the pioneering work lavoisier the prolonged and exhaustive experiments jean stas supported the strict accuracy this law chemical even though they were carried out with other his research indicated that certain reactions the loss gain could not have been more than from parts the difference the accuracy aimed and attained lavoisier the one and morley and stas the generalization conservation mass special relativity conservation energy special the conservation mass does not apply the system open and energy however does continue apply totally closed systems energy cannot escape its mass cannot relativity long any type energy retained within this energy exhibits also mass must differentiated from matter see since matter may not perfectly conserved isolated even though mass always conserved such however matter nearly conserved chemistry that violations matter conservation were not measured until the nuclear and the assumption matter conservation remains important practical concept most systems chemistry and other studies that not involve the high energies typical radioactivity and nuclear reactions the mass associated with chemical amounts energy too small measure the change mass certain kinds open systems where atoms massive particles are not allowed but other types energy such light are allowed enter went unnoticed during the because the change mass associated with addition loss small quantities thermal radiant energy chemical reactions very mass would not change all for experiments conducted isolated systems where heat and work were not allowed the theoretical association all energy with mass was made albert einstein however max planck pointed out that the change mass systems result extraction addition chemical predicted small that could not measured with available for example test einstein speculated that the energies associated with newly discovered radioactivity were significant compared with the mass systems producing enable their change once the energy the reaction had been removed from the this later indeed proved although was eventually the first artificial nuclear transmutation reaction demonstrated cockcroft and walton that proved the first successful test theory regarding loss with mass conservation remains correct energy not lost the conservation relativistic mass implies the viewpoint single observer the view from single inertial since changing inertial frames may result change the total energy relativistic for and this quantity determines the relativistic the principle that the mass system particles must equal the sum their rest masses even though true classical may false special relativity the reason that rest masses cannot simply added that this does not take into account other forms such kinetic and potential and massless particles such all which may may affect the total mass for moving massive particles examining the rest masses the various particles also amounts introducing many different inertial observation frames which prohibited total system energy and momentum are and also when the rest frame one this procedure ignores the momenta other which affect the system mass the other particles are motion this for the special type mass called invariant mass changing the inertial frame observation for whole closed system has effect the measure invariant mass the which remains both conserved and invariant even for different observers who view the entire invariant mass system combination energy and which invariant for any because any inertial the energies and momenta the various particles always add the same quantity the momentum may the addition amounts the invariant mass the relativistic mass the system when viewed the center momentum frame the minimum mass which system may viewed from all possible inertial the conservation both relativistic and invariant mass applies even systems particles created pair production where energy for new particles may come from kinetic energy other from one more photons part system that includes other particles besides again neither the relativistic nor the invariant mass totally closed that isolated systems changes when new particles are however different inertial observers will disagree the value this conserved the relativistic mass relativistic mass conserved not however all observers agree the value the conserved mass the mass being measured the invariant mass invariant mass both conserved and the energy equivalence formula gives different prediction isolated systems since energy allowed escape both relativistic mass and invariant mass will escape this the energy equivalence formula predicts that the change mass system associated with the change its energy due energy being added this form involving changes was the form which this famous equation was originally presented this mass changes any system are explained simply the mass the energy added removed from the are taken into the formula implies that bound systems have invariant mass rest mass for the less than the sum their the binding energy has been allowed escape the system after the system has been this may happen converting system potential energy into some other kind active such kinetic energy which easily escape bound the difference system called mass measure the binding energy bound systems other the energy needed break the system the greater the mass the larger the binding the binding energy which itself has must released light when the parts combine form the bound and this the reason the mass the bound system decreases when the energy leaves the the total invariant mass actually when the mass the binding energy that has taken into exceptions caveats matter conservation matter not perfectly conserved the principle matter conservation may considered approximate physical law that true only the classical without consideration special relativity and quantum mechanics approximately true except certain high energy particular difficulty with the idea conservation matter that matter not defined word and when particles that are considered matter such electrons and are annihilated make photons which are often not considered then conservation matter does not take place over even within isolated however matter conserved such extent that matter conservation may safely assumed chemical reactions and all situations which radioactivity and nuclear reactions are not even when matter not the mass and energy associated with matter are conserved open systems and thermodynamically closed systems mass also not generally conserved open systems such the case when various forms energy are allowed out the system see for binding energy however again unless radioactivity nuclear reactions are the amount energy escaping such systems work electromagnetic radiation usually too small measured decrease system the law mass conservation for isolated systems totally closed all mass and viewed over time from any single inertial frame continues true modern the reason for this that relativistic equations show that even massless particles such photons still add mass and energy isolated allowing mass though not strictly conserved all processes where energy does not escape the different observers may disagree the particular value the conserved mass given but each observer will agree that this value does not change over time long the system isolated totally closed general relativity general the total invariant mass photons expanding volume space will due the red shift such expansion see mass general relativity the conservation both mass and energy therefore depends various corrections made energy the due the changing gravitational potential energy such see also conservation law continuity
