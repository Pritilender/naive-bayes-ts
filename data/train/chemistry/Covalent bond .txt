chemistry	covalent bond navigation search covalent hydrogen atoms covalent bond chemical bond that involves the sharing electron pairs between atoms the stable balance attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons known covalent for many the sharing electrons allows each atom attain the equivalent full outer corresponding stable electronic covalent bonding includes many kinds including bonding bonding metal metal agostic interactions and three center electron bonds the term covalent bond dates from the prefix means jointly associated partnered lesser etc thus valent means that the atoms share valence such discussed valence bond theory the molecule the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent covalency greatest between atoms similar electronegativities thus covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms the same only that they comparable covalent bonding that entails sharing electrons over more than two atoms said delocalized contents history physical properties covalent compounds polar and polarity covalent bonds subdivision covalent bonds see also references sources external links history methane lewis structure the term covalence regard bonding was first used irving langmuir journal the american chemical society article entitled the arrangement electrons atoms and langmuir wrote that shall denote the term covalence the number pairs electrons that given atom shares with its the idea covalent bonding can traced several years before gilbert lewis who described the sharing electron pairs between introduced the lewis notation electron dot notation lewis dot structure which valence electrons those the outer are represented dots around the atomic pairs electrons located between atoms represent covalent multiple pairs represent multiple such double bonds and triple bonds alternative form not shown has forming electron pairs represented solid lewis proposed that atom forms enough covalent bonds form full outer electron the methane diagram shown the carbon atom has valence four and therefore surrounded eight electrons the octet rule four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded each hydrogen has valence one and surrounded two electrons duet its own one electron plus one from the the numbers electrons correspond full shells the quantum theory the the outer shell carbon atom the shell which can hold eight whereas the outer and shell hydrogen atom the shell which can hold only while the idea shared electron pairs provides effective qualitative picture covalent quantum mechanics needed understand the nature these bonds and predict the structures and properties simple walter heitler and fritz london are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation chemical bond molecular hydrogen their work was based the valence bond which assumes that chemical bond formed when there good overlap between the atomic orbitals participating these atomic orbitals are known have specific angular relationships between each and thus the valence bond model can successfully predict the bond angles observed simple physical properties covalent compounds polar and polarity covalent bonds covalent bonds are affected the electronegativity the connected two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such unequal relationship creates polar covalent bond such with subdivision covalent bonds there are three types covalent individual molecular and macromolecular structures individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms but there are negligible forces attraction between such covalent substances are usually for hcl and molecular there are weak forces such covalent substances are temperature liquids such ethanol and temperature solids such iodine and solid macromolecular structures have large numbers atoms linked chains sheets such graphite dimensional structures such diamond and quartz these substances have high melting and boiling are frequently and tend have high electrical resistivity elements that have high electronegativity and the ability form three four electron pair often form such large macromolecular see also bonding solids bond order coordinate covalent bond also known dipolar bond dative covalent bond covalent bond classification lxz covalent radius disulfide bond hybridization hydrogen bond ionic bond linear combination atomic orbitals metallic bonding noncovalent bonding resonance shared pair
