microscopic arrangement atoms inside called the crystal structure crystal solid where the atoms form periodic quasicrystals are see below not all solids are for when liquid water starts the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they forming polycrystalline structure the final block each the small crystals called crystallites grains true crystal with periodic arrangement but the whole polycrystal does not have periodic arrangement because the periodic pattern broken the grain boundaries most macroscopic inorganic solids are including almost all metals ceramics ice rocks etc solids that are neither crystalline nor such glass are called amorphous solids also called glassy vitreous these have periodic even there are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous most the process forming glass does not release the latent heat fusion but forming crystal crystal structure arrangement atoms characterized its unit cell small imaginary box containing one more atoms specific spatial the unit cells are stacked dimensional space form the the symmetry crystal constrained the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with there are possible crystal called crystallographic space groups these are grouped into crystal systems such cubic crystal system where the crystals may form cubes rectangular such halite shown hexagonal crystal system where the crystals may form such ordinary water ice crystal faces and shapes halite dangling bonds stable crystals are commonly recognized their consisting flat faces with sharp these shape characteristics are not necessary for crystal scientifically defined its microscopic atomic not its macroscopic but the characteristic macroscopic shape often present and easy euhedral crystals are those with well formed flat anhedral crystals usually because the crystal one grain polycrystalline the flat faces also called facets euhedral crystal are oriented specific way relative the underlying atomic arrangement the crystal they are planes relatively low miller index this occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others lower surface energy crystal new atoms attach easily the rougher and less stable parts the but less easily the stable therefore the flat surfaces tend grow larger and until the whole crystal surface consists these plane see diagram one the oldest techniques the science crystallography consists measuring the dimensional orientations the faces and using them infer the underlying crystal symmetry crystal habit its visible external this determined the crystal structure which restricts the possible facet the specific crystal chemistry and bonding which may favor some facet types over and the conditions under which the crystal occurrence nature ice fossil shell calcite rocks volume and the largest concentrations crystals the earth are part the solid bedrock some crystals have formed magmatic and metamorphic processes giving origin large masses crystalline rock the vast majority igneous rocks are formed from molten magma and the degree crystallization depends primarily the conditions under which they such rocks granite which have cooled very slowly and under great have completely but many kinds lava were poured out the surface and cooled very and this latter group small amount amorphous glassy matter other crystalline the metamorphic rocks such marbles mica schists and quartzites are this means that they were first fragmental rocks like limestone shale and sandstone and have never been molten condition nor entirely but the high temperature and pressure conditions metamorphism have acted them erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization the solid other rock crystals have formed out precipitation from commonly form druses quartz veins the evaporites such halite gypsum and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous mostly owing evaporation arid ice based ice the form snow sea ice and glaciers very common manifestation crystalline polycrystalline matter single snowflake typically single while ice cube polycrystal organigenic crystals many living organisms are able produce for example calcite and aragonite the case most molluscs hydroxylapatite the case vertebrates polymorphism and allotropy polymorphism materials allotropy the same group atoms can often solidify many different polymorphism the ability solid exist more than one crystal for water ice ordinarily found the hexagonal form ice but can also exist the cubic ice the rhombohedral ice and many other the different polymorphs are usually called different phases the same atoms may able form noncrystalline phases for water can also form amorphous ice while sio can form both fused silica amorphous and quartz likewise substance can form can also form for pure chemical polymorphism known allotropy for diamond and graphite are two crystalline forms carbon while amorphous carbon noncrystalline polymorphs despite having the same may have wildly different for diamond among the hardest substances while graphite soft that used polyamorphism similar phenomenon where the same atoms can exist more than one amorphous solid form crystallization cooling crystallizer crystallization crystal growth crystallization the process forming crystalline structure from fluid from materials dissolved more crystals may deposited directly from see thin film deposition and epitaxy crystallization complex and studied because depending the single fluid can solidify into many different possible can form single crystal perhaps with various possible phases stoichiometries impurities defects and habits can form polycrystal with various possibilities for the arrangement orientation and phase its the final form the solid determined the conditions under which the fluid being such the chemistry the the ambient pressure the temperature and the speed with which all these parameters are specific industrial techniques produce large single crystals called boules include the czochralski process and the bridgman technique other less exotic methods crystallization may depending the physical properties the including hydrothermal synthesis sublimation simply solvent based crystallization large single crystals can created geological for selenite crystals excess meters are found the cave the crystals mexico for more details geological crystal see above crystals can also formed biological see above conversely some organisms have special techniques prevent crystallization from such antifreeze proteins defects impurities and twinning crystallographic defect impurity crystal twinning top edge dislocation bottom screw dislocation ideal crystal has every atom exactly repeating however most crystalline materials have variety crystallographic defects places where the pattern the types and structures these defects may have profound effect the properties the few examples crystallographic defects include vacancy defects empty space where atom should interstitial defects extra atom squeezed where does not and dislocations see figure dislocations are especially important materials science because they help determine the mechanical strength materials another common type crystallographic defect impurity meaning that the wrong type atom present for perfect crystal diamond would only contain carbon atoms but real crystal might perhaps contain few boron atoms these boron impurities change the diamond color slightly likewise the only difference between ruby and sapphire the type impurities present corundum crystal twinned pyrite semiconductors special type called dopant drastically changes the electrical semiconductor devices such transistors are made possible largely putting different semiconductor dopants into different specific twinning phenomenon somewhere between crystallographic defect and grain boundary like grain twin boundary has different crystal orientations its two but unlike grain the orientations are not but related mirror image chemical bonds crystalline structures occur all classes with all types chemical bonds almost all metal exists polycrystalline amorphous crystal metals must produced often with great ionically bonded crystals can form upon solidification salts either from molten fluid upon crystallization from covalently bonded crystals are also very notable examples being diamond silica and graphite polymer materials generally will form crystalline but the lengths the molecules usually prevent complete

but not strictly they have many attributes common with ordinary such displaying discrete pattern ray diffraction and the ability form shapes with flat quasicrystals are most famous for their ability show fold which impossible for ordinary periodic crystal see crystallographic restriction theorem the international union crystallography has redefined the term crystal include both ordinary periodic crystals and quasicrystals any solid having essentially discrete diffraction diagram quasicrystals first discovered are quite rare only about solids are known form compared about periodic crystals measured the nobel prize chemistry was awarded dan shechtman for the discovery special properties from anisotropy crystal optics crystals can have certain special optical and mechanical properties that glass and polycrystals normally these properties are related the anisotropy the the lack rotational symmetry its atomic one such property the piezoelectric effect where voltage across the crystal can shrink stretch another birefringence where double image appears when looking through moreover various properties including electrical conductivity electrical permittivity and young modulus may different different directions for graphite crystals consist stack and although each individual sheet mechanically very the sheets are rather loosely bound each therefore the mechanical strength the material quite different depending the direction not all crystals have all these conversely these properties are not quite exclusive they can appear glasses polycrystals that have been made
