gemological characteristic gem the experts gemology have developed methods grading diamonds and other gemstones based the characteristics most important their value four known informally the four are now commonly used the basic descriptors these are carat cut color and clarity flawless diamond known paragon natural history the formation natural diamond requires very specific exposure bearing materials high ranging approximately between and kilobars and gpa but comparatively low temperature range between approximately and and these conditions are met two places the lithospheric mantle below relatively stable continental plates and the site meteorite formation cratons the conditions for diamond formation happen the lithospheric mantle occur considerable depth corresponding the requirements temperature and these depths are estimated between and kilometers and though occasionally diamonds have crystallized depths about kilometers the rate which temperature changes with increasing depth into the earth varies greatly different parts the under oceanic plates the temperature rises more quickly with beyond the range required for diamond formation the depth the correct combination temperature and pressure only found the ancient and stable parts continental plates where regions lithosphere known cratons exist long residence the cratonic lithosphere allows diamond crystals grow through studies carbon isotope ratios similar the methodology used carbon dating except with the stable isotopes and has been shown that the carbon found diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic some known harzburgitic are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep the eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface the crust through subduction see plate tectonics before transforming into these two different source carbon have measurably different diamonds that have come the surface are generally quite ranging from under billion billion years this the age the earth diamonds occur most often euhedral rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known macles crystal structure has cubic arrangement the they have many facets that belong cube octahedron rhombicosidodecahedron tetrakis hexahedron disdyakis dodecahedron the crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can sometimes they are found grown together form double twinned crystals the surfaces the these different shapes and habits some diamonds result from differing external diamonds especially those with rounded crystal are commonly found coated nyf opaque like space diamonds aggregated diamond nanorod primitive interstellar meteorites were found contain carbon possibly the form diamond lewis not all diamonds found earth originated type diamond called carbonado that found south america and africa may have been deposited there via asteroid impact not formed from the about billion years these diamonds may have formed the intrastellar but there was scientific consensus how carbonado diamonds diamonds can also form under other naturally occurring pressure very small diamonds micrometer and nanometer known microdiamonds nanodiamonds respectively have been found meteorite impact craters such impact events create shock zones high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond impact type microdiamonds can used indicator ancient impact popigai crater russia may have the largest diamond estimated trillions and formed asteroid scientific evidence indicates that white dwarf stars have core crystallized carbon and oxygen the largest these found the universe bpm located light years away the constellation centaurus news release from the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics described the mile wide stellar core diamond was referred lucy after the song lucy the sky with transport from mantle bearing rock carried from the mantle the surface origin volcanic the magma for such volcano must originate depth where diamonds can formed more three times more the depth source magma for most this relatively rare these typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward formations known volcanic pipes the pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface volcanic but was not ejected before the volcanic activity during eruption these pipes are open the resulting open many xenoliths surface rock and even wood and fossils are found volcanic diamond bearing volcanic pipes are closely related the coolest regions continental crust this because cratons are very and their lithospheric mantle extends great enough depth that diamonds are not all pipes contain and even fewer contain enough diamonds make mining economically diamonds are very rare because most the crust too thin permit diamond whereas most the mantle has relatively little the magma volcanic pipes usually one two characteristic which cool into igneous rock known either kimberlite the magma itself does not contain instead acts elevator that carries formed rocks minerals xenocrysts and fluids these rocks are characteristically rich magnesium bearing olivine pyroxene and amphibole minerals which are often altered serpentine heat and fluids during and after certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used mineralogical tracers who follow the indicator trail back the volcanic pipe which may contain these minerals are rich chromium titanium elements which impart bright colors the the most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets usually bright red pyrope and occasionally green series eclogitic orange red chromium spinels dark chromite bright green diopside glassy green black picroilmenite and magnetite kimberlite deposits are known blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part the yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion once diamonds have been transported the surface magma volcanic they may erode out and distributed over large volcanic pipe containing diamonds known primary source secondary sources diamonds include all areas where significant number diamonds have been eroded out their kimberlite lamproite and accumulated because water wind these include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient where loose diamonds tend accumulate because their size and diamonds have also rarely been found deposits left behind glaciers notably wisconsin and indiana contrast alluvial glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources material properties material properties diamond crystallographic defects diamond phase diagram allotropes diamond transparent crystal tetrahedrally bonded carbon atoms covalent network lattice that crystallizes into the diamond lattice which variation the face centered cubic structure diamonds have been adapted for many uses because the exceptional physical most notable are its extreme hardness and thermal conductivity well wide bandgap and high optical above vacuum free diamond converts transformation starts diamond ignition point oxygen and naturally occurring diamonds have density ranging from with pure diamond close the chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms diamonds together are weaker than those the bonds form inflexible dimensional whereas the atoms are tightly bonded into which can slide easily over one making the overall structure hardness diamond the hardest known natural material the mohs scale mineral hardness where hardness defined resistance scratching and graded between and diamond has hardness this diamond hardness has been known since and the source its diamond hardness depends its crystalline perfection and hardness higher for pure crystals oriented the direction along the longest diagonal the cubic diamond therefore whereas might possible scratch some diamonds with other such boron nitride the hardest diamonds can only scratched other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates the hardness diamond contributes its suitability because can only scratched other maintains its polish extremely unlike many other suited daily wear because its resistance perhaps contributing its popularity the preferred gem engagement wedding rings which are often worn every vickers hardness tester the hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from the copeton and bingara fields located the new england area new south wales australia these diamonds are generally perfect semiperfect and are used polish other their hardness associated with the crystal growth form which stage crystal most other diamonds show more evidence multiple growth which produce flaws and defect planes the crystal all which affect their possible treat regular diamonds under combination high pressure and high temperature produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used hardness somewhat related hardness another mechanical property toughness which ability resist breakage from forceful the toughness natural diamond has been measured mpa this value good compared other but poor compared most engineering with any the macroscopic geometry diamond contributes its resistance diamond has cleavage plane and therefore more fragile some orientations than diamond cutters use this attribute cleave some prior impact one the main indexes measure the quality synthetic industrial electrical conductivity other specialized applications also exist are being including use semiconductors some blue diamonds are natural contrast most which are excellent electrical insulators the conductivity and blue color originate from boron boron substitutes for carbon atoms the diamond donating hole into the valence band substantial conductivity commonly observed nominally undoped diamond grown chemical vapor deposition this conductivity associated with related species adsorbed the and can removed annealing other surface surface property diamonds are naturally lipophilic and hydrophobic which means the surface cannot wet water but can easily wet and stuck this property can utilized extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic however when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain they are expected become hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers water ice human body temperature chemical stability diamonds are not very under room temperature diamonds not react with any chemical reagents including strong acids and surface can only oxidized little just few oxidants high temperature below therefore acids and bases can used refine synthetic color diamond color national museum natural history diamond has wide bandgap corresponding the deep ultraviolet wavelength nanometers this means pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear clear colorless colors diamond originate from lattice defects and the diamond crystal lattice exceptionally strong and only atoms boron and hydrogen can introduced into diamond during the growth significant concentrations atomic transition metals and which are commonly used for growth synthetic diamond pressure temperature have been detected diamond individual the maximum concentration for and even less for virtually any element can introduced diamond ion nitrogen far the most common impurity found gem diamonds and responsible for the yellow and brown color boron responsible for the blue color diamond has two additional irradiation usually alpha that causes the color green and plastic deformation the diamond crystal plastic deformation the cause color some brown and perhaps pink and red order yellow diamond followed colorless then green black pink orange purple and black carbonado diamonds are not truly but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark colored diamonds contain impurities structural defects that cause the while pure nearly pure diamonds are transparent and most diamond impurities replace carbon atom the crystal lattice known carbon flaw the most common nitrogen causes slight intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration nitrogen the gemological institute america classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds diamonds the normal color range and applies grading scale from light diamonds different such are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under different grading the wittelsbach diamond carat blue diamond once belonging the king fetched over million may carat blue diamond fetched the highest price per carat ever paid for diamond when was sold auction for million swiss francs million euro million the that record was however beaten the same carat vivid pink diamond was sold for million hong kong december identification diamonds can identified their high thermal their high refractive index also but other materials have similar diamonds cut but this does not positively identify diamond because other such also lie above glass the mohs scale and can also cut diamonds can scratch other but this can result damage one both hardness tests are infrequently used practical gemology because their potentially destructive the extreme hardness and high value diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention detail than the case with most other these tend result extremely highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet diamonds also possess extremely high refractive index and fairly high taken these factors affect the overall appearance polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use loupe magnifying identify diamonds industry brilliant cut diamonds investment the diamond industry can separated into two distinct one dealing with grade diamonds and another for

diamonds were cut and polished surat india other important centers diamond cutting and trading are the antwerp diamond district belgium where the international gemological institute london the diamond district new york tel aviv and single company beers controls significant proportion the trade they are based johannesburg south africa and england one contributory factor the geological nature diamond several large primary pipe mines each account for significant portions market share such the jwaneng mine which single large pit operated beers that can produce between carats carats diamonds per whereas secondary alluvial diamond deposits tend fragmented amongst many different operators because they can dispersed over many hundreds square kilometers alluvial deposits the production and distribution diamonds largely consolidated the hands few key and concentrated traditional diamond trading the most important being where all rough all cut diamonds and more than all cut and industrial diamonds combined are this makes antwerp facto world diamond another important diamond center new york city where almost the diamonds are including auction the debeers the largest diamond miner holds dominant position the and has done since soon after its founding the british imperialist cecil rhodes beers owns controls significant portion the rough diamond production facilities and distribution channels for quality the diamond trading company subsidiary beers and markets rough diamonds from operated beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some annual world diamond for most the century over the rough diamonds passed through but the figure had decreased around and the market share had further decreased around value terms and even less beers sold off the vast majority its diamond stockpile the late early and the remainder largely represents working stock diamonds that are being sorted before this was well documented the press but remains little known the general part reducing its beers withdrew from purchasing diamonds the open market and the end purchasing russian diamonds mined the largest russian diamond company alrosa january beers states that only sells diamonds from the following four botswana namibia south africa and alrosa had suspend their sales october due the global energy crisis but the company reported that had resumed selling rough diamonds

and billion retail cutting diamond cutting diamond cut nur mined rough diamonds are converted into gems through step process called cutting diamonds are extremely but also brittle and can split single therefore diamond cutting traditionally considered delicate procedure requiring scientific tools and its final goal produce faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond that dispersion white whereas the number and area facets would determine the weight the final the weight reduction upon cutting significant and can the order several possible shapes are but the final decision often determined not only but also practical for example the diamond might intended for display for ring singled surrounded other gems certain color and the most consuming part the cutting the preliminary analysis the rough needs address large number bears much and therefore can last years case unique the following issues are the hardness diamond and its ability cleave strongly depend the crystal therefore the crystallographic structure the diamond cut analyzed using ray diffraction choose the optimal cutting most diamonds contain visible diamond inclusions and crystal the cutter has decide which flaws are removed the cutting and which could the diamond can split well calculated blow hammer pointed which but alternatively can cut with diamond saw which more reliable but tedious after initial the diamond shaped numerous stages unlike which responsible but quick polishing removes material gradual erosion and extremely time the associated technique well considered routine and can performed after the diamond reexamined for possible either remaining induced the those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques such crack clever arrangement the stone the remaining diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling the voids marketing marketing has significantly affected the image diamond valuable ayer son the advertising firm retained beers the succeeded reviving the american diamond and the firm created new markets countries where diamond tradition had existed ayer marketing included product placement advertising focused the diamond product itself rather than the beers and associations with celebrities and without advertising the beers beers was also advertising its diamond products market share dipped temporarily place the global market below alrosa the aftermath the global economic crisis down less than terms carats rather than the campaign lasted for decades but was effectively discontinued early beers still advertises but the advertising now mostly promotes its own licensed product rather than completely generic diamond the campaign was perhaps best captured the slogan

early diamond identification tests included scratch test relying the superior hardness this test diamond can scratch and rarely used instead diamond identification relies its superior thermal electronic thermal probes are widely used the gemological centers separate diamonds from their these probes consist pair powered thermistors mounted fine copper one thermistor functions heating device while the other measures the temperature the copper the stone being tested will conduct the thermal energy rapidly enough produce measurable temperature this test takes about seconds whereas the thermal probe can separate diamonds from most their distinguishing between various types for example synthetic irradiated etc requires more optical those techniques are also used for some diamonds such silicon which pass the thermal conductivity optical techniques can distinguish between natural diamonds and synthetic they can also identify the vast majority treated natural perfect crystals the atomic lattice have never been both natural and synthetic diamonds always possess characteristic arising from the circumstances their crystal that allow them distinguished from each laboratories use techniques such microscopy and luminescence under shortwave ultraviolet light determine they also use specially made instruments aid them the identification two screening instruments are the diamondsure and the diamondview both produced the dtc and marketed the several methods for identifying synthetic diamonds can depending the method production and the color the cvd diamonds can usually
