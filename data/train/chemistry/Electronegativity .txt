electronegativity navigation search electronegative electronegativity symbol chemical property that describes the tendency atom functional group attract electrons electron density towards electronegativity affected both its atomic number and the distance which its valence electrons reside from the charged the higher the associated electronegativity the more element compound attracts electrons towards first proposed linus pauling development valence bond theory has been shown correlate with number other chemical electronegativity cannot directly measured and must calculated from other atomic molecular several methods calculation have been and although there may small differences the numerical values the all methods show the same periodic trends between elements the most commonly used method calculation that originally proposed linus this gives dimensionless quantity commonly referred the pauling scale relative scale running from around hydrogen when other methods calculation are conventional although not quote the results scale that covers the same range numerical this known electronegativity pauling units electronegativity usually not strictly property but rather property atom molecule properties free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity expected that the electronegativity element will vary with its chemical but usually considered transferable property that say that similar values will valid variety the most basic electronegativity determined factors like the nuclear charge the more protons atom the more pull will have negative and the location other electrons present the atomic shells the more electrons atom the farther from the nucleus the valence electrons will and result the less positive charge they will both because their increased distance from the and because the other electrons the lower energy core orbitals will act shield the valence electrons from the positively charged the opposite electronegativity

explanation the fact that the covalent bond between two different atoms stronger than would expected taking the average the strengths the and according valence bond theory which pauling was notable this additional the heteronuclear bond due the contribution ionic canonical forms the the difference electronegativity between atoms and given where the dissociation energies the and bonds are expressed electronvolts the factor being included ensure dimensionless hence the difference pauling electronegativity between hydrogen and bromine dissociation only differences electronegativity are necessary choose arbitrary reference point order construct hydrogen was chosen the forms covalent bonds with large variety its electronegativity was fixed first later revised also necessary decide which the two elements the more electronegative equivalent choosing one the two possible signs for the square this usually done using chemical the above hydrogen bromide dissolves water form and ions may assumed that bromine more electronegative than however since the same electronegativities should obtained for any two bonding the data fact and the signs are unique once reference point fixed for calculate pauling electronegativity for necessary have data the dissociation energies least two types covalent bond formed that allred updated original values take account the greater availability thermodynamic and these revised values the electronegativity that are most often the essential point pauling electronegativity that there quite semi empirical formula for dissociation namely more accurate fit this approximate but holds with good pauling obtained noting that bond can approximately represented quantum mechanical superposition covalent bond and two ionic the covalent energy bond quantum mechanical the geometric mean the two energies covalent bonds the same and there additional energy that comes from ionic polar character the the geometric mean approximately equal the arithmetic mean which applied the first formula above when the energies are the similar except for the highly electropositive where there larger difference two dissociation the geometric mean more accurate and almost always gives positive excess due ionic the square root this excess pauling approximately and hence one can introduce the thus this empirical formula for bond energy that underlies pauling electronegativity the formulas are but this rough approximation fact relatively good and gives the right with the notion polarity the bond and some theoretical grounding quantum the electronegativities are then determined best fit the more complex there additional error since electronegativity depends the molecular environment also the energy estimate can only used for not for multiple the energy formation molecule containing only single bonds then can approximated from electronegativity and depends the constituents and sum squares differences electronegativities all pairs bonded such formula for estimating energy typically has relative error order but can used get rough qualitative idea and understanding mulliken electronegativity robert mulliken proposed that the arithmetic mean the first ionization energy and the electron affinity should measure the tendency atom attract this definition not dependent arbitrary relative has also been termed absolute electronegativity with the units kilojoules per mole electronvolts however more usual use linear transformation transform these absolute values into values that resemble the more familiar pauling for ionization energies and electron affinities and for energies kilojoules per the mulliken electronegativity can only calculated for element for which the electron affinity fifty seven elements the mulliken electronegativity atom sometimes said the negative the chemical inserting the energetic definitions the ionization potential and electron affinity into the mulliken possible show that the mulliken chemical potential finite difference approximation the electronic energy with respect the number allred rochow electronegativity louis allred and eugene rochow considered that electronegativity should related the charge experienced electron the surface the higher the charge per unit area atomic surface the greater the tendency that atom attract the effective nuclear charge experienced valence electrons can estimated using slater rules while the surface area atom molecule can taken proportional the square the covalent radius when expressed picometres sanderson electronegativity equalization sanderson has also noted the relationship between mulliken electronegativity and atomic and has proposed method calculation based the reciprocal the atomic with knowledge bond sanderson model allows the estimation bond energies wide range sanderson model has also been used calculate molecular electrons nmr spin spin constants and other parameters for organic this work underlies the concept electronegativity equalization which suggests that electrons distribute themselves around molecule minimize equalize the mulliken this behavior analogous the equalization chemical potential macroscopic allen electronegativity perhaps the simplest definition electronegativity that leland allen who has proposed that related the average energy the valence electrons free where are the electron energies and electrons the free atom and are the number and electrons the valence usual apply scaling for energies expressed kilojoules per mole for energies measured give values that are numerically similar pauling the electron energies can determined directly from spectroscopic data and electronegativities calculated this method are sometimes referred spectroscopic electronegativities the necessary data are available for almost all and this method allows the estimation electronegativities for elements that cannot treated the other francium which has allen electronegativity however not clear what should considered valence electrons for the and block which leads ambiguity for their electronegativities calculated the allen this scale neon has the highest electronegativity all followed fluorine helium and oxygen electronegativity using the allen scale group period electronegativities the elements data correlation electronegativity with other properties ssbauer spectroscopy the wide variety methods calculation which all give results that correlate well with one one indication the number chemical properties which might affected the most obvious application electronegativities the discussion bond polarity for which the concept was introduced the greater the difference electronegativity between two atoms the more polar the bond that will formed between with the atom having the higher electronegativity being the negative end the pauling proposed equation relate ionic bond the difference electronegativity the two although this has fallen somewhat into several correlations have been shown between infrared stretching frequencies certain bonds and the electronegativities the atoms however this not surprising such stretching frequencies depend part bond which enters into the calculation pauling more convincing are the correlations between electronegativity and chemical shifts nmr spectroscopy isomer shifts ssbauer spectroscopy see both these measurements depend the electron density the and are good indication that the different measures electronegativity really are describing the ability atom molecule attract electrons trends electronegativity periodic trends electronegativity increases passing from left right along and decreases descending hence fluorine the most electronegative the elements not counting noble gases whereas caesium the least least those elements for which substantial data there are some exceptions this general gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because the block contraction elements the fourth period immediately after the first row the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the electrons are not effective shielding the increased nuclear and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity see allred rochow electronegativity sanderson electronegativity above the anomalously high electronegativity lead particular when compared thallium and bismuth appears artifact data selection and data methods calculation other than the pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these variation electronegativity with oxidation number inorganic chemistry common consider single value the electronegativity valid for most normal situations while this approach has the advantage clear that the electronegativity element not invariable atomic property increases with the oxidation state the allred used the pauling method calculate separate electronegativities for different oxidation states the handful elements including tin and for which sufficient data was however for most there are not enough different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known make this approach this particularly true the transition where quoted electronegativity values are averages over several different oxidation states and where trends electronegativity are harder see hypochlorous acid chlorous acid chloric acid perchloric acid the chemical effects this increase electronegativity can seen both the structures oxides and halides and the acidity oxides and hence cro and are acidic oxides with low melting points while amphoteric and completely basic oxide the effect can also clearly seen the dissociation constants the oxoacids chlorine the effect much larger than could explained the negative charge being shared among larger number oxygen which would lead difference log between hypochlorous acid and perchloric acid the oxidation state the central chlorine atom more electron density drawn from the oxygen atoms onto the reducing the partial negative charge the oxygen atoms and increasing the group electronegativity organic electronegativity associated more with different functional groups than with individual the terms group electronegativity and substituent electronegativity are used however common distinguish between the inductive effect and the resonance effect which might described and respectively there are number linear energy relationships that have been used quantify these which the hammett equation the best kabachnik parameters are group electronegativities for use organophosphorus chemistry electropositivity electropositivity measure ability donate electrons and therefore form positive ions thus opposed mainly this attribute metals meaning the greater the metallic character element the greater the therefore the alkali metals are most electropositive this because they have single electron their outer shell this relatively far from the nucleus the easily other these metals have low ionization energies while electronegativity increases along periods the periodic table and decreases down groups electropositivity decreases along periods from left and increases down electropositive shark repellent utilizes electropositive metals shark repellents since they generate measurable voltages seawater electrolyte relative see
