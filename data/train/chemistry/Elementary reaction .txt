elementary reaction navigation search elementary reaction chemical reaction which one more the chemical species react directly form products single reaction step and with single transition state unimolecular elementary molecule dissociates isomerises form the constant the rate such reaction proportional the concentration the species bimolecular elementary two atoms molecules ions radicals and react together form the the rate such constant proportional the product the concentrations the species and the rate expression for elementary bimolecular reaction sometimes referred the law mass action was first proposed guldberg and waage example this type reaction cycloaddition reaction this rate expression can derived from first principles using collision theory for ideal for the case dilute fluids equivalent results have been obtained from simple probabilistic according collision theory the probability three chemical species reacting simultaneously with each other termolecular elementary reactions hence such termolecular reactions are commonly referred elementary reactions and can broken down into more fundamental set bimolecular agreement with the law mass action however not always possible derive overall reaction schemes but solutions based rate equations are possible terms steady state michaelis menten approximations
