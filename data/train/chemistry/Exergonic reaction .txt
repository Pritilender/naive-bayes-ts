chemistry	exergonic reaction navigation search exergonic reaction chemical reaction where the change the free energy indicating spontaneous reaction for processes that take place under constant pressure and temperature the gibbs free energy used whereas the helmholtz energy used for processes that take place under constant volume and temperature symbolically the release free exergonic reaction constant pressure and denoted although exergonic reactions are said occur spontaneously this does not imply that the reaction will take place observable rate for the disproportionation hydrogen peroxide very slow the absence suitable has been suggested that eager would more intuitive term this more the terms exergonic and endergonic relate the free energy change any not just chemical example exergonic reaction cellular the terms exothermic and endothermic relate the overall exchange heat during see also endergonic reaction
