reaction stoichiometry batch production this defined the concentration chemical reagents and their volumetric ratio flow this defined the concentration reagents and the ratio their flow residence batch production this determined how long vessel held given flow the volumemetric residence time used given the ratio volume the reactor and the overall flow most plug flow reactors are running flow reactions choosing run chemical reaction using flow either microreactor other mixing device offers variety pros and advantages reaction temperature can raised above the boiling point the volume the laboratory devices typically typically non compressible fluids are used with gas volume that the expansion factor function pressure mixing can achieved within seconds the smaller scales used flow heat transfer mostly because the area volume ratio thereby endothermal and exothermal reaction can the temperature gradient can allowing efficient control over reaction safety thermal mass the system dominated the apparatus making thermal runaways smaller reaction volume also considered safety the reactor operates under steady state conditions flow reactions can automated with far less effort than batch this allows for unattended operation and experimental coupling the output the reactor detector possible further and create automated system which can sequentially investigate range possible reaction parameters varying stoichiometry residence time and and therefore explore reaction parameters with little typical drivers are higher less needed manpower higher safety multi step reactions can arranged continuous this can especially beneficial intermediate compounds are toxic sensitive since they will exist only momentarily and very small position along the flowing stream and reaction time point are directly related one this means that possible arrange the system such that further reagents can introduced into the flowing reaction stream precisely the time point the reaction that possible arrange flowing system such that purification coupled with the there are three primary techniques that are solid phase scavenging chromatographic separation liquid extraction reactions which involve reagents containing dissolved gases are easily whereas batch pressurized bomb reactor would multi phase liquid reactions phase transfer catalysis can performed straightforward with high reproducibility over range scales and scale proven reaction can achieved rapidly with little process development either changing the reactor volume running several reactors provided that flows are recalculated achieve the same residence disadvantages dedicated equipment needed for precise continuous dosing pumps connections etc start and shut down procedures have scale micro effects such the high area volume ratio not possible and economy scale may not typically scale leads dedicated safety issues for the storage reactive material still the drawbacks have been discussed view establishing small scale continuous production processes pashkova and continuous flow reactors continuous reactors are typically tube like and manufactured from reactive materials such stainless glass and mixing methods include diffusion alone the diameter the reactor small such microreactors and static mixers continuous flow reactors allow good control over reaction conditions including heat time and the residence time the reagents the reactor the amount time that the reaction heated calculated from the volume the reactor and the flow rate through therefore achieve longer residence reagents can pumped more slowly larger volume reactor production rates can vary from nano liters liters per some examples flow reactors are spinning disk reactors colin spinning tube multi cell flow oscillatory flow microreactors hex and aspirator aspirator reactor pump propels one which causes reactant sucked this type reactor was patented around the nobel company for the production nitroglycerin flow reactor scale the smaller scale micro flow reactors microreactors can make them ideal for process development although possible operate flow processes ton synthetic efficiency benefits from improved thermal and mass transfer well mass key application areas use gases flow laboratory scale flow reactors are ideal systems for using particularly those that are toxic associated with other the gas reactions that have been most successfully adapted flow are hydrogenation and carbonylation although work has also been performed using other ethylene and ozone reasons for the suitability flow systems for hazardous gas handling systems allow the use fixed bed catalyst combined with low solution this allows all compound adsorbed catalyst the presence gas comparatively small amounts gas are continually exhausted the eliminating the need for many the special precautions normally required for handling toxic flammable gases the addition pressure means that far greater proportion the gas will solution during the reaction than the case conventionally the greatly enhanced mixing the liquid and gaseous phases allows the researcher exploit the kinetic benefits elevated temperatures without being concerned about the gas being displaced from solution process development the process development change from serial approach parallel batch the chemist works first followed the chemical flow chemistry this changes parallel where chemist and chemical engineer work typically there plant setup the which the tool for this setup can either commercial non the development scale can small for idea verification using chip system and the range couple liters per hour for scalable systems like the flow miniplant technology chip systems are mainly used for liquid application while flow miniplant systems can deal with solids viscous scale microwave reactions microwave reactors are frequently used for small scale batch however due the extremes temperature and pressure reached microwave often difficult transfer these reactions conventional microwave apparatus for subsequent leading difficulties with scaling flow reactor with suitable high temperature ability and pressure control can directly and accurately mimic the conditions created microwave this eases the synthesis larger quantities extending reaction manufacturing scale solutions flow systems can scaled the tons per hour plant redesign batch conti for existing unit operation exchaning only one reaction and modular purpose cutting continuous plant into modular are typical realization solutions for flow other uses flow possible run experiments flow using more sophisticated such solid phase chemistries solid phase reagents catalysts scavengers can used solution and pumped through glass for the synthesis alkaloid natural product oxomaritidine using solid phase there increasing interest polymerization continuous flow for example reversible fragmentation chain transfer raft polymerization continuous flow techniques have also been used for controlled generation the very rapid mixing and excellent temperature control microreactors are able give consistent and narrow particle size distribution segmented flow chemistry discussed running experiments continuous flow systems especially when one developing new chemical which requires screening multiple varying temperature and residence continuous experiments are performed which means one experimental condition can experimental throughput highly variable and typically five times the residence time needed for obtaining steady state for temperature variation the thermal mass the reactor well peripherals such fluid baths need more often than the analysis time needs segmented flow approach that improves upon the speed which optimization and libraries can conducted flow segmented flow uses plug flow approach where specific volumetric experimental mixtures are created and then injected into high pressure flow diffusion the segment reaction minimized using immiscible solvent the leading and rear ends the one the primary benefits segmented flow chemistry the ability run experiments parallel manner where experiments that share the same residence time and temperature can repeatedly created and the volume each experiment independent that the volume the flow tube thereby saving significant amount reactant per when performing reaction screening and segment composition typically varied composition when performing reaction segments vary segmented flow also used with online both analytical and preparative where the
