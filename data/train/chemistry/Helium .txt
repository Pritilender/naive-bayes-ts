and the second most abundant element the observable universe being present about the total elemental which more than times the mass all the heavier elements its abundance similar this figure the sun and jupiter this due the very high nuclear binding energy per nucleon helium with respect the next three elements after this binding energy also accounts for why product both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay most helium the universe and believed have been formed during the big bang large amounts new helium are being created nuclear fusion hydrogen stars helium named for the greek god the

august bright yellow line with wavelength nanometers the spectrum the chromosphere the sun the line was detected french astronomer jules janssen during total solar eclipse guntur india this line was initially assumed sodium october the same english astronomer norman lockyer observed yellow line the solar which named the fraunhofer line because was near the known and lines concluded that was caused element the sun unknown lockyer and english chemist edward frankland named the element with the greek word for the helios italian physicist luigi palmieri detected helium for the first through its spectral when analyzed the lava mount vesuvius william ramsay march scottish chemist sir william ramsay isolated helium earth treating the mineral cleveite variety uraninite with least rare earth elements with mineral acids ramsay was looking for argon but after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated sulfuric acid noticed bright yellow line that matched the line observed the spectrum the these samples were identified helium lockyer and british physicist william crookes was independently isolated from cleveite the same year chemists per teodor cleve and abraham langlet uppsala sweden who collected enough the gas accurately determine its atomic weight helium was also isolated the american geochemist william francis hillebrand prior discovery when noticed unusual spectral lines while testing sample the mineral hillebrand however attributed the lines his letter congratulations ramsay offers interesting case discovery and discovery ernest rutherford and thomas royds demonstrated that alpha particles are helium nuclei allowing the particles penetrate the thin glass wall evacuated then creating discharge the tube study the spectra the new gas helium was first liquefied dutch physicist heike kamerlingh onnes cooling the gas less than one kelvin tried solidify further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have triple point temperature which the liquid and gas phases are onnes student willem hendrik keesom was eventually able solidify helium applying additional external russian physicist pyotr leonidovich kapitsa discovered that helium has almost viscosity temperatures near absolute zero phenomenon now called superfluidity this phenomenon related bose einstein condensation the same phenomenon was observed helium but temperatures much closer absolute american physicists douglas osheroff david lee and robert richardson the phenomenon thought related pairing fermions make bosons analogy cooper pairs electrons

and took them back the university kansas lawrence with the help chemists hamilton cady and david discovered that the gas consisted nitrogen methane combustible percentage only with sufficient hydrogen and unidentifiable with further cady and mcfarland discovered that the gas sample was this showed that despite its overall rarity helium was concentrated large quantities under the american great plains available for extraction byproduct natural gas this enabled the united states become the leading supplier following suggestion sir richard threlfall the united states navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during world war the goal was supply barrage balloons with the lighter air total helium was produced the program even though less than cubic meter the gas had previously been some this gas was used the first filled the navy which flew its maiden voyage from hampton virginia bolling field december although the extraction using temperature gas liquefaction was not developed time significant during world war production helium was primarily used lifting gas air this use increased demand during world war well demands for shielded arc welding the helium mass spectrometer was also vital the atomic bomb manhattan project the government the united states set the national helium reserve amarillo texas with the goal supplying military airships time war and commercial airships because the helium control act which banned the export scarce helium which the then had production together with the prohibitive cost the the hindenburg like all german zeppelins was forced use hydrogen the lift helium use following world war was depressed but the reserve was expanded the ensure supply liquid helium coolant create hydrogen rocket fuel among other during the space race and cold war helium use the united states was more than eight times the peak wartime after the helium acts amendments public law the bureau mines arranged for five private plants recover helium from natural for this helium conservation program the bureau built mile pipeline from bushton kansas connect those plants with the partially depleted cliffside gas near texas this nitrogen mixture was injected and stored the cliffside gas field until when then was further billion cubic meters the gas had been collected and the reserve was billion prompting the congress the united states phase out the the resulting helium privatization act public law directed the united states department the interior empty the with sales starting helium produced between and was about pure nitrogen which was adequate for small amount helium was produced for welding commercial quantities grade helium were for many years the united states produced over commercially usable helium the while extraction plants poland russia and other nations produced the the new plant arzew algeria producing million cubic meters million cubic began with enough production cover all meanwhile the consumption helium within the had risen above million per two additional one ras laffan qatar and the other skikda algeria were algeria quickly became the second leading producer through this both helium consumption and the costs producing helium from helium prices the united states national helium reserve accounted for percent the the reserve was expected run out helium despite that proposed bill the united states senate would allow the reserve continue sell the other large reserves were the hugoton kansas united states and nearby gas fields kansas and the panhandles texas and oklahoma new helium plants were scheduled open qatar russia and the united states state wyoming but they were not expected ease the characteristics the helium atom helium atom the helium nucleus electron cloud helium quantum mechanics the perspective quantum mechanics helium the second simplest atom following the hydrogen atom helium composed two electrons atomic orbitals surrounding nucleus containing two protons along with some newtonian system consisting more than two particles can solved with exact analytical mathematical approach see body problem and helium thus numerical mathematical methods are even solve the system one nucleus and two such computational chemistry methods have been used create quantum mechanical picture helium electron binding which accurate within the correct few computational such models found that each electron helium partly screens the nucleus from the that the effective nuclear charge which each electron about units not the charges classic bare helium the related stability the nucleus and electron shell the nucleus the atom identical with alpha particle high energy scattering experiments show its charge decrease exponentially from maximum central exactly does the charge density own electron cloud this symmetry reflects similar underlying the pair neutrons and the pair protons nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules pair electrons although the nuclear particles are subject different nuclear binding that all these fermions fully occupy orbitals none them possessing orbital angular and each cancelling the intrinsic adding another any these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy nucleus with five nucleons this arrangement thus energetically extremely stable for all these and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium for the stability and low energy the electron cloud state helium accounts for the chemical and also the lack interaction helium atoms with each producing the lowest melting and boiling points all the similar the particular energetic stability the nucleus produced similar accounts for the ease production atomic reactions involving both particle and some stable produced fusion reactions from but very small compared with the highly favorable the unusual stability the nucleus also important explains the fact that the first few minutes after the big bang the soup free protons and neutrons which had initially been created about ratio cooled the point that nuclear binding was almost all first compound atomic nuclei form were nuclei tight was binding that production consumed nearly all the free neutrons few before they could and also leaving few form heavier atoms such beryllium helium nuclear binding per nucleon stronger than any these elements see nucleogenesis and binding energy and thus energetic drive was once helium had been make elements and was barely energetically favorable for helium fuse into the next element with lower energy per nucleon carbon however due lack intermediate this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously see triple alpha process there was thus time for significant carbon formed the few minutes after the big before the early expanding universe cooled the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion carbon was longer this left the early universe with very similar ratio helium observed today parts hydrogen part with nearly all the neutrons the universe trapped all heavier elements including those necessary for rocky planets like the and for based other have thus been created since the big bang stars which were hot enough fuse helium all elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only the mass atomic matter the helium makes about the ordinary nearly all the ordinary matter that not gas and plasma phases helium the second least reactive noble gas after neon and thus the second least reactive all inert and monatomic all standard because relatively low molar mass its thermal conductivity specific heat and sound speed the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen for similar and also due the small size helium helium diffusion rate through solids three times that air and around that helium the least water soluble monatomic and one the least water soluble any gas and have lower mole fraction and respectively versus and index refraction closer unity than that any other helium has negative joule thomson coefficient normal ambient meaning heats when allowed freely only below its joule thomson inversion temperature about does cool upon free once precooled below this helium can liquefied through expansion most extraterrestrial helium found plasma state with properties quite different from those atomic helium electrons are not bound its resulting very high electrical even when the gas only partially the charged particles are highly influenced magnetic and electric for the solar wind together with ionized the particles interact with the magnetosphere giving rise birkeland currents and the aurora solid liquid and superfluid phases the following text needs harmonized with text liquid helium superfluidity liquid helium unlike any other helium will remain liquid down absolute zero normal this direct effect quantum specifically the zero point energy the system too high allow solid helium requires temperature about and about bar often hard distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index the two phases are nearly the the solid has sharp melting point and has crystalline structure but highly compressible applying pressure laboratory can decrease its volume more than with bulk modulus about mpa times more compressible than solid helium has density and the projected density and bar mpa helium state below its boiling point kelvins and above the lambda point the isotope helium exists normal colorless liquid called helium like other cryogenic liquids helium boils when heated and contracts when its temperature below the lambda however helium does not and expands the temperature lowered helium has like index refraction which makes its surface hard see that floats styrofoam are often used show where the surface this colorless liquid has very low viscosity and density between about and which only fourth the value expected from classical physics quantum mechanics needed explain this property and thus both types liquid helium are called quantum fluids meaning they display atomic properties macroscopic this may effect its boiling point being close absolute preventing random molecular motion thermal energy from masking the atomic helium state liquid helium below its lambda point begins exhibit very unusual state called helium when due its high thermal conductivity does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its helium also has superfluid phase but only much lower less known about such properties the rollin film helium quantum mechanical state macroscopic quantum phenomena matter with strange for when flows through capillaries thin has measurable viscosity however when measurements were done between two moving viscosity comparable that gaseous helium was current theory explains this using the two fluid model for helium this liquid helium below the lambda point viewed containing proportion helium atoms ground state which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero and proportion helium atoms excited which behave more like ordinary the fountain effect chamber constructed which connected reservoir sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which superfluid helium cannot the interior the container the superfluid helium changes superfluid order maintain the equilibrium fraction superfluid superfluid helium leaks through and increases the causing liquid fountain out the the thermal conductivity greater than that any other known million times that and several hundred times that copper this because heat conduction occurs exceptional quantum most materials that conduct heat well have valence band free electrons which serve transfer the helium has such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat the flow heat governed equations that are similar the wave equation used characterize sound propagation when heat moves meters per second through waves phenomenon known second sound helium also exhibits creeping when surface extends past the level the moves along the against the force gravity helium will escape from vessel that not sealed creeping along the sides until reaches warmer region where moves thick film regardless surface this film called rollin film and named after the man who first characterized this bernard rollin result this creeping behavior and ability leak rapidly through tiny very difficult confine liquid unless the container carefully the will creep along the surfaces and through valves until reaches somewhere where will waves propagating across rollin film are governed the same equation gravity waves shallow but rather than the restoring force the van der waals force these waves are known third sound isotopes isotopes helium there are eight known isotopes but only helium and helium are stable the there one atom for every million atoms unlike most helium isotopic abundance varies greatly due the different formation the most common helium produced earth alpha decay heavier radioactive the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized nuclei helium unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells was also formed enormous quantities during big bang nucleosynthesis helium present earth only trace most since though some falls earth trapped cosmic dust trace amounts are also produced the beta decay tritium rocks from the crust have isotope ratios varying much factor and these ratios can used investigate the origin rocks and the composition the mantle much more abundant product nuclear thus the interstellar medium the proportion around times higher than extraplanetary such lunar and asteroid regolith have trace amounts from being bombarded solar winds the moon surface contains concentrations the order ppm much higher than the ppt found the number starting with gerald kulcinski have proposed explore the mine lunar regolith and use the for fusion liquid can cooled about kelvin using evaporative cooling pot similar cooling which has lower boiling can achieve about kelvin helium refrigerator equal mixtures liquid and below separate into two immiscible phases due their dissimilarity they follow different quantum statistics helium atoms are bosons while atoms are fermions dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility achieve temperatures few possible produce exotic helium isotopes which rapidly decay into other the lived heavy helium isotope with half life helium decays emitting beta particle and has life helium also emits beta particle well gamma ray helium and are created certain nuclear reactions helium and are known exhibit nuclear halo compounds noble gas compound helium hydride ion helium has valence zero and chemically unreactive under all normal electrical insulator unless ionized with the other noble helium has metastable energy levels that allow remain ionized electrical discharge with voltage below its ionization potential helium can form

metastable heo anion first theorized group from confirmed the only remaining element with known stable compounds would neon helium has been put inside the hollow carbon cage molecules the fullerenes heating under high the endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable high when chemical derivatives these fullerenes are the helium stays helium can readily observed helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy many fullerenes containing have been although the helium atoms are not attached covalent ionic these substances have distinct properties and definite like all stoichiometric chemical occurrence and production natural abundance although rare helium the second most abundant element the known universe after hydrogen constituting its baryonic mass the vast majority helium was formed big bang nucleosynthesis one three minutes after the big measurements its abundance contribute cosmological stars formed the nuclear fusion hydrogen proton proton chain reactions and the cno cycle part stellar nucleosynthesis the earth atmosphere the concentration helium volume only parts per the concentration low and fairly constant despite the continuous production new helium because most helium the atmosphere escapes into space several the heterosphere part the upper helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant most helium earth result radioactive decay helium found large amounts minerals uranium and thorium including cleveite pitchblende carnotite and monazite because they emit alpha particles helium which electrons immediately combine soon the particle stopped the this way estimated metric tons helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere the the concentration helium parts per the concentration only parts per there are also small amounts mineral springs volcanic and meteoric iron because helium trapped the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural the greatest natural concentrations helium the planet are found natural from which most commercial helium the concentration varies broad range from few ppm over small gas field san juan new mexico modern extraction and distribution for scale helium extracted fractional distillation from natural which can contain helium since helium has lower boiling point than any other low temperature and high pressure are used liquefy nearly all the other gases mostly nitrogen and methane the resulting crude helium gas purified successive exposures lowering which almost all the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out the gaseous activated charcoal used final purification usually resulting pure the principal impurity helium neon final production most the helium that produced liquefied via cryogenic process this necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers reduce the cost long distance the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity the largest gaseous helium tube approximately million standard cubic meters helium were extracted from natural gas withdrawn from helium reserves with approximately from the united from and most the remainder from poland and the united most helium extracted from natural gas the hugoton and nearby gas fields oklahoma and the panhandle field much this gas was once sent pipeline the national helium reserve but since this reserve presently being depleted and sold diffusion crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and other barriers another method recover and purify the had proven helium such gas well about billion standard cubic feet billion rates use that time million scm per year the see pie chart this enough helium for about years use and less than this perhaps the world use although factors saving and processing impact effective reserve helium must extracted from natural gas because present air only fraction that yet the demand for far estimated that all neon production were retooled save that the helium demands would similarly only the helium demands could satisfied tooling all air distillation helium can synthesized bombardment lithium boron with velocity but this process completely uneconomic method helium commercially available either liquid gaseous can supplied small insulated containers called dewars which hold liters large iso containers which have nominal capacities large around gallons gaseous small quantities helium are supplied pressure cylinders holding standard cubic feet while large quantities pressure gas are supplied tube trailers which have capacities standard cubic conservation advocates according helium conservationists like robert coleman richardson the free market price helium has contributed wasteful usage for helium balloons prices the have been lowered congress decision sell off the large helium stockpile according the current price needs multiplied eliminate the excessive wasting their the future helium natural resource nuttall clarke glowacki also proposed create international helium agency build sustainable market for this precious applications estimated fractional helium use total use million cubic while balloons are perhaps the most known use they are minor part all helium helium used for many purposes that require some its unique such its low boiling point low density low solubility high thermal conductivity inertness the world helium total

also useful supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities gas tungsten arc welding gas tungsten arc welding helium used shielding gas arc welding processes materials that welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened air number inert shielding gases are used gas tungsten arc but helium used instead cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity like aluminium copper minor uses industrial leak detection one industrial application for helium leak detection because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than used tracer gas detect leaks vacuum equipment such cryogenic and pressure the tested object placed which then evacuated and filled with the helium that escapes through the leaks detected sensitive device helium mass spectrometer even the leak rates small mbar the measurement procedure normally automatic and called helium integral simpler procedure fill the tested object with helium and manually search for leaks with held helium leaks through cracks should not confused with gas permeation through bulk while helium has documented permeation constants thus calculable permeation through ceramics and synthetic inert gases such helium will not permeate most bulk flight goodyear blimp because lighter than air airships and balloons are inflated with helium for while hydrogen gas also helium has the advantage being flammable addition being fire another minor use rocketry where helium used ullage medium displace fuel and oxidizers storage tanks and condense hydrogen and oxygen make rocket fuel also used purge

oxygen mixtures begin experience tremors and decrease psychomotor symptoms high pressure nervous syndrome this effect may countered some extent adding amount narcotic gas such hydrogen nitrogen oxygen these depths the low density helium found considerably reduce the effort helium neon lasers type powered gas laser producing red had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers before they were almost universally replaced cheaper diode lasers for its inertness and high thermal conductivity neutron and because does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor helium used transfer medium some cooled nuclear reactors helium mixed with heavier gas such useful for thermoacoustic refrigeration due the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low prandtl number the inertness helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute ozone depletion global helium also used some hard disk drives scientific uses the use helium
