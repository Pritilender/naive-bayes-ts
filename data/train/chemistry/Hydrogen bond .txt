such nitrogen oxygen fluorine the name hydrogen bond something not true bond but particularly strong dipole dipole attraction and should not confused with covalent bond these bond attractions can occur between molecules intermolecular within different parts single molecule intramolecular the hydrogen bond stronger than van der waals interaction but weaker than covalent ionic bonds this type bond can occur inorganic molecules such water and organic molecules like dna and intermolecular hydrogen bonding responsible for the high boiling point water compared the other group hydrides that have hydrogen intramolecular hydrogen bonding partly responsible for the secondary and tertiary structures proteins and nucleic acids also plays important role the structure polymers both synthetic

acetylacetone enol tautomer hydrogen atom attached relatively electronegative atom hydrogen bond this electronegative atom usually fluorine oxygen nitrogen electronegative atom such oxygen nitrogen hydrogen bond whether bonded hydrogen atom example hydrogen bond donor ethanol which has hydrogen bonded example hydrogen bond acceptor that does not have hydrogen atom bonded the oxygen atom diethyl ether green hydrogen attached carbon can also participate hydrogen bonding when the carbon atom bound electronegative the case chloroform chcl the electronegative atom attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus decentralizing the leaves the atom with positive partial because the small size hydrogen relative other atoms and the resulting though only represents large charge hydrogen bond results when this strong positive charge density attracts lone pair electrons another heteroatom which becomes the bond acceptor the hydrogen bond often described electrostatic dipole dipole interaction however also has some features covalent bonding directional and produces interatomic distances shorter than sum van der waals and usually involves limited number interaction which can interpreted type valence these covalent features are more substantial when acceptors bind hydrogens from more electronegative the partially covalent nature hydrogen bond raises the following which molecule atom does the hydrogen nucleus belong and which should labeled and which usually this simple determine the basis interatomic distances the distance typically whereas distance liquids that display hydrogen bonding are called associated liquids hydrogen bonds can vary strength from very weak mol extremely strong mol the ion typical enthalpies vapor mol kcal mol kcal mol kcal mol kcal mol kcal mol kcal data obtained using molecular dynamics detailed the reference and should compared mol for bulk obtained using the same molecular dynamics quantum chemical calculations the relevant interresidue potential constants compliance revealed large differences between individual bonds the same for the central interresidue hydrogen bond between guanine and cytosine much stronger comparison the bond between the thymine the length hydrogen bonds depends bond temperature and the bond strength itself dependent pressure bond and environment usually characterized local dielectric constant the typical length hydrogen bond water the ideal bond angle depends the nature the hydrogen bond the following hydrogen bond angles between hydrofluoric acid donor and various acceptors have been determined history the book the nature the chemical bond linus pauling credits moore and winmill with the first mention the hydrogen moore and winmill used the hydrogen bond account for the fact that trimethylammonium hydroxide weaker base than tetramethylammonium hydroxide the description hydrogen bonding its known water came some years from latimer and that latimer and rodebush cite work fellow scientist their maurice loyal huggins saying huggins this laboratory some work yet has used the idea hydrogen kernel held between two atoms theory regard certain organic hydrogen bonds water the most ubiquitous and perhaps simplest example hydrogen bond found between water molecules discrete water there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen two molecules water can form hydrogen bond between the simplest when only two molecules are called the water dimer and often used model when more molecules are the case with liquid more bonds are possible because the oxygen one water molecule has two lone pairs each which can form hydrogen bond with hydrogen another water this can repeat such that every water molecule bonded with four other shown the figure two through its two lone and two through its two hydrogen hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure ice helping create open hexagonal the density ice less than the density water the same thus the solid phase water floats the unlike most other liquid water high boiling point due the high number hydrogen bonds each molecule can relative its low molecular mass owing the difficulty breaking these water has very high boiling melting and viscosity compared otherwise similar liquids not conjoined hydrogen water unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen meaning that the total number bonds water molecule for hydrogen which has three lone pairs the atom but only one can form only two ammonia has the opposite three hydrogen atoms but only one lone the exact number hydrogen bonds formed molecule liquid water fluctuates with time and depends the from tip liquid water simulations was estimated that each water molecule participates average hydrogen this number decreases due the increased molecular motion and decreased while the average number hydrogen bonds increases more recent study found much smaller number hydrogen the differences may due the use different method for defining and counting the hydrogen where the bond strengths are more one might instead find the atoms two interacting water molecules partitioned into two polyatomic ions opposite specifically hydroxide and hydronium hydronium ions are also known ions indeed pure water under conditions standard temperature and pressure this latter formulation applicable only average about one every molecules gives proton another water accordance with the value the dissociation constant for water under such crucial part the uniqueness because water forms hydrogen bonds with the donors and acceptors solutes dissolved within inhibits the formation hydrogen bond between two molecules those solutes the formation intramolecular hydrogen bonds within those solutes through competition for their donors and consequently hydrogen bonds between within solute molecules dissolved water are almost always unfavorable relative hydrogen bonds between water and the donors and acceptors for hydrogen bonds those hydrogen bonds between water molecules have duration about seconds bifurcated and coordinated hydrogen bonds water can that single hydrogen atom participates two hydrogen rather than this type bonding called bifurcated split two can exist for instance complex natural synthetic organic was suggested that bifurcated hydrogen atom essential step water type hydrogen bonds terminating lone are more likely form bifurcation called overcoordinated oco than are type hydrogen beginning the same hydrogen bonds dna and proteins double helix guanine cytosine base pairs hydrogen bonding also plays important role determining the dimensional structures adopted proteins and nucleic these bonding between parts the same macromolecule cause fold into specific which helps determine the physiological biochemical for the double helical structure dna due largely hydrogen bonding between its base pairs well stacking interactions which link one complementary strand the other and enable replication the secondary structure proteins hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and amide when the spacing the amino acid residues participating hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions and alpha helix when the spacing between positions and then helix when two strands are joined hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues each participating beta sheet hydrogen bonds also play part forming the tertiary structure protein through interaction see also protein folding the role hydrogen bonds protein folding has also been linked induced protein protective such trehalose and sorbitol shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded concentration dependent while the prevalent explanation for osmolyte action relies excluded volume that are entropic recent circular dichroism experiments have shown osmolyte act through enthalpic the molecular mechanism for their role protein stabilization still not well though several mechanism have been recently computer molecular dynamics simulations suggested that osmolytes stabilize proteins modifying the hydrogen bonds the protein hydration several studies have shown that hydrogen bonds play important role for the stability between subunits multimeric for study sorbitol dehydrogenase displayed important hydrogen bonding network which stabilizes the tetrameric quaternary structure within the mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase protein protein backbone hydrogen bond incompletely shielded from water attack dehydron dehydrons promote the removal water through proteins ligand binding the exogenous dehydration enhances the electrostatic interaction between the amide and carbonyl groups shielding their partial charges furthermore the dehydration stabilizes the hydrogen bond destabilizing the nonbonded state consisting dehydrated isolated charges hydrogen bonds polymers many polymers are strengthened hydrogen bonds their main among the synthetic polymers the best known example nylon where hydrogen bonds occur the repeat unit and play major role crystallization the the bonds occur between carbonyl and amine groups the amide repeat they effectively link adjacent chains create which help reinforce the the effect greatest aramid fibre where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains the chain axes are aligned along the fibre making the fibres extremely stiff and hydrogen bonds are also important the structure cellulose and derived polymers its many different forms such wood and natural fibres such cotton and flax the hydrogen bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive humidity levels the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the some polymers are more sensitive than thus nylons are more sensitive than aramids and nylon more sensitive than nylon symmetric hydrogen bond symmetric hydrogen bond special type hydrogen bond which the proton spaced exactly halfway between two identical the strength the bond each those atoms example three center electron bond this type bond much stronger than normal hydrogen the effective bond order its strength comparable covalent seen ice high and also the solid phase many anhydrous acids such hydrofluoric acid and formic acid high also seen the bifluoride ion symmetric hydrogen bonds have been observed recently spectroscopically formic acid high pressure each hydrogen atom forms partial covalent bond with two atoms rather than symmetric hydrogen bonds have been postulated ice high pressure ice low barrier hydrogen bonds form when the distance between two heteroatoms very dihydrogen bond the hydrogen bond can compared with the closely related dihydrogen bond which also intermolecular bonding interaction involving hydrogen these structures have been known for some and well characterized crystallography however understanding their relationship the conventional hydrogen ionic bond and covalent bond remains generally the hydrogen bond characterized proton acceptor that lone pair electrons nonmetallic atoms most notably the nitrogen and chalcogen groups some these proton acceptors may bonds metal complexes the dihydrogen however metal hydride serves proton thus forming hydrogen neutron diffraction has shown that the molecular geometry these complexes similar hydrogen that the bond length very adaptable the metal hydrogen donor advanced theory the hydrogen bond isaacs showed from interpretations the anisotropies the compton profile ordinary ice that the hydrogen bond partly some nmr data hydrogen bonds proteins also indicate covalent most the hydrogen bond can viewed metric dependent electrostatic scalar field between two more intermolecular this slightly different from the intramolecular bound states for covalent ionic bonds however hydrogen bonding generally still bound state phenomenon since the interaction energy has net negative the initial theory hydrogen bonding proposed linus pauling suggested that the hydrogen bonds had partial covalent this remained controversial conclusion until the late when nmr techniques were employed cordier transfer information between bonded feat that would only possible the hydrogen bond contained some covalent while much experimental data has been recovered for hydrogen bonds water for that provide good resolution the scale intermolecular distances and molecular thermodynamics the kinetic and dynamical properties the hydrogen bond dynamic systems remain dynamics probed spectroscopic means the dynamics hydrogen bond structures water can probed the
