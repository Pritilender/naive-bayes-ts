reducing agent high temperature the presence catalysts sulfur dioxide can made react with hydrogen sulfide form elemental sulfur and water this exploited the claus process the main way convert hydrogen sulfide into elemental hydrogen sulfide slightly soluble water and acts weak acid giving the hydrosulfide ion litre solutions solution hydrogen sulfide known sulfhydric acid hydrosulfuric acid initially clear but over time turns this due the slow reaction hydrogen sulfide with the oxygen dissolved yielding elemental which precipitates the sulfide dianion exists only strongly alkaline aqueous exceptionally basic with hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions form metal sulfides which may considered the salts hydrogen some ores are metal sulfides often have dark lead acetate paper used detect hydrogen sulfide because turns grey the presence the gas lead sulfide reacting metal sulfides with strong acid liberates hydrogen gaseous hydrogen sulfide put into contact with concentrated nitric acid hydrogen sulfide reacts with alcohols form thiols important class organosulfur compounds production hydrogen sulfide most commonly obtained its separation from sour gas which natural gas with high content can also produced reacting hydrogen gas with molten elemental sulfur about hydrocarbons can replace hydrogen this sulfate reducing sulfur reducing bacteria generate usable energy under oxygen conditions using sulfates elemental oxidize organic compounds this produces hydrogen sulfide waste the standard lab preparation react ferrous sulfide with strong acid kipp generator less known and more convenient alternative react aluminium sulfide with this gas also produced heating sulfur with solid organic compounds and reducing sulfurated organic compounds with hydrogen sulfide production can costly because the dangers involved occurrence small amounts hydrogen sulfide occur crude petroleum but natural gas can contain volcanoes and some hot springs well cold springs emit some where probably arises via the hydrolysis sulfide citation needed hydrogen sulfide can present naturally well often result the action sulfate reducing bacteria portion global emissions are due human far the largest industrial route occurs petroleum refineries the hydrodesulfurization process liberates sulfur from petroleum the action the resulting converted elemental sulfur partial combustion via the claus process which major source elemental other anthropogenic sources hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens paper mills using the sulfate and tanneries arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes contact with organic especially high was reported that increased concentration possibly due oil field was observed the bakken formation crude and presented challenges such health and environmental corrosion added expense with regard materials handling and pipeline and additional refinement uses production thioorganic compounds several organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen these include methanethiol ethanethiol and thioglycolic acid alkali metal sulfides upon combining with alkali metal bases hydrogen sulfide converts alkali hydrosulfides such sodium hydrosulfide and sodium sulfide which are used the degradation the depilation hides and the delignification pulp the kraft process both are effected alkali analytical chemistry for well over hydrogen sulfide was important analytical chemistry the qualitative inorganic analysis metal these heavy metal and nonmetal ions are precipitated from solution upon exposure the components the resulting precipitate redissolve with some for scale laboratory use analytic the use thioacetamide has superseded source sulfide precursor metal sulfides indicated many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide give the corresponding metal this conversion widely for gases waters contaminated hydrogen sulfide can cleaned with metal the purification metal ores flotation mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide enhance the metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen catalysts used hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen and the behavior metallic catalysts used other parts refinery also modified using hydrogen miscellaneous applications hydrogen sulfide used separate deuterium heavy water from normal water via the girdler

filtration through impregnated activated carbon activated carbon landfill biogas chp treatment plasma plasma dissociation hydrogen sulfide safety hydrogen sulfide highly toxic and flammable gas flammable range being heavier than tends accumulate the bottom poorly ventilated although very pungent quickly deadens the sense victims may unaware its presence until too for safe handling hydrogen sulfide material safety data sheet should toxicity hydrogen sulfide considered spectrum meaning that can poison several different systems the although the nervous system most the toxicity comparable with that hydrogen cyanide carbon monoxide forms complex bond with iron the mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes thus preventing cellular respiration since hydrogen sulfide occurs naturally the the environment and the enzymes exist the body capable detoxifying oxidation sulfate hence low levels hydrogen sulfide may tolerated some threshold believed average around ppm the oxidative enzymes become many personal safety gas such those used sewage and petrochemical are set alarm low ppm and into high alarm ppm diagnostic clue extreme poisoning the discoloration copper coins the pockets the treatment involves immediate inhalation amyl nitrite injections sodium nitrite administration dimethylaminophenol combination with inhalation pure administration bronchodilators overcome eventual bronchospasm and some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot has clinical and anecdotal exposure lower concentrations can result eye irritation sore throat and cough nausea shortness and fluid the lungs pulmonary edema these effects are believed due the fact that hydrogen sulfide combines with alkali present moist surface tissues form sodium sulfide caustic these symptoms usually away few long low level exposure may result fatigue loss headaches irritability poor and dizziness chronic exposure low level around ppm has been implicated increased miscarriage and reproductive health issues among russian and finnish wood pulp but the reports have not circa been short high level exposure can induce immediate with high probability death does not studies have shown high exposure hydrogen sulfide can lead cortical pseudolaminar necrosis and degeneration the basal ganglia has also been shown that cerebral edema has been the cause death some fatal exposures with hydrogen ppm ppb the odor also known the recognition the point which human panel can detect the presence the compound its its characteristic odor normally described resembling rotten ppm the osha permissible exposure limit hour weighted ppm the borderline concentration for eye ppm the acceptable ceiling concentration established ppm the acceptable maximum peak above the ceiling concentration for hour with maximum duration minutes ppm leads eye ppm the olfactory nerve paralyzed after few and the sense smell often together with awareness ppm leads pulmonary edema with the possibility ppm causes strong stimulation the central nervous system and rapid leading loss ppm the lethal concentration for humans for minutes exposure concentrations over ppm cause immediate collapse with loss even after inhalation single cortical pseudolaminar necrosis degeneration the basal ganglia and cerebral edema have also been although respiratory paralysis may can also delayed hours incidents hydrogen sulfide was used the british army chemical weapon during world war was not considered ideal war but while other gases were short was used two occasions hydrogen sulfide release from oil drilling operation denver texas killed nine people and caused the state legislature focus the deadly hazards the state representative short took the lead endorsing investigation the texas railroad commission and urged that residents warned knocking doors the imminent danger stemming from the one may die from the second inhalation the and warning itself may too dump toxic waste containing hydrogen sulfide believed have caused deaths and thousands illnesses abidjan the west african the ivoire toxic waste dump suicides the produced mixing certain household was used suicide wave the wave prompted staff suicide prevention center set special hot line during golden week they received increase calls from people wanting kill themselves during the annual may this phenomenon has occurred number prompting warnings those arriving the site the these first such emergency services workers family members are risk death from inhaling lethal quantities the local governments have also initiated campaigns prevent such function the body hydrogen sulfide produced small amounts some cells the mammalian body and has number biological signaling only two other such gases are currently nitric oxide and carbon monoxide the gas produced from cysteine the enzymes cystathionine synthase and cystathionine lyase acts relaxant smooth muscle and vasodilator and also active the brain where increases the response the nmda receptor and facilitates long term potentiation which involved the formation eventually the gas converted sulfite the mitochondria thiosulfate reductase and the sulfite further oxidized thiosulfate and sulfate sulfite oxidase the sulfates are excreted the due its effects similar nitric oxide without its potential form peroxides interacting with superoxide hydrogen sulfide now recognized potentially protecting against cardiovascular the cardioprotective role effect garlic caused catabolism the polysulfide group allicin reaction that could depend reduction mediated glutathione though both nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide have been shown relax blood their mechanisms action are while activates the enzyme guanylyl cyclase activates atp sensitive potassium channels smooth muscle researchers are not clear how the relaxing responsibilities are shared between nitric oxide and hydrogen however there exists some evidence suggest that nitric oxide does most the relaxing work large vessels and hydrogen sulfide responsible for similar action smaller blood additionally reacts with intracellular nitrosothiols form the smallest nitrosothiol and role hydrogen sulfide controlling the intracellular nitrosothiol pool has been like nitric hydrogen sulfide involved the relaxation smooth muscle that causes erection the presenting possible new therapy opportunities for erectile dysfunction interdependence hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide recent findings suggest strong cellular crosstalk and demonstrating that the vasodilatatory effects these two gases are mutually hydrogen sulfide deficiency hydrogen sulfide deficiency can detrimental the vascular function after acute myocardial infarction amis can lead cardiac dysfunction through two distinct increased oxidative stress via free radical accumulation and decreased free radical accumulation occurs due increased electron transport uncoupling the active site endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme involved converting arginine during oxidative degradation tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor limits availability and limits productionby instead enos reacts with another cosubstrates involved the products enos are reduced increasing free radical production and oxidative stress within the deficiency impairs enos activity limiting akt activation and inhibiting akt phosphorylation the activation instead akt activity increased phosphorylate the inhibition downregulating enos production hydrogen sulfide therapy acute myocardial infarction therapy uses such diallyl trisulfide increase the supply ami donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion increased levels within the body will react with oxygen produce sulfane storage intermediate for pools the body attracts oxygen react with excess and enos increase with increased use oxygen produce more less oxygen available react with enos produce superoxides during ultimately lowering the accumulation reactive oxygen species furthermore decreased accumulation ros lowers oxidative stress vascular smooth muscle decreasing oxidative degeneration increased cofactor contributes increased production within the higher concentrations directly increase enos activity through akt activation increase phosphorylation the activation and decrease phosphorylation the inhibition this phosphorylation process upregulates enos catalyzing more conversion arginine increased production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase activity leading increased conversion guanosine triphosphate cyclic guanosine monophosphate therapy immediately following increased cgmp triggers increase protein kinase activity pkg reduces intracellular vascular smooth muscle increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood pkg also limits smooth muscle cell reducing intima thickening following ami ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct alzheimer disease the hydrogen sulfide concentration severely certain rat model parkinson disease the hydrogen sulfide concentration was found and administering hydrogen sulfide alleviated the trisomy down the body produces excess hydrogen hydrogen sulfide also involved the disease process type diabetes the beta cells the pancreas type diabetes produce excess the leading the death these cells and reduced production insulin those that induced hypothermia and suspended animation was shown that mice can put into state suspended animation like hypothermia applying low dosage hydrogen sulfide ppm the the breathing rate the animals sank from breaths per minute and their temperature fell from just above ambient temperature they had become cold blooded the mice survived this procedure for hours and afterwards showed negative health was shown that the blood pressure mice treated this fashion with hydrogen sulfide did not significantly similar process known hibernation occurs naturally many mammals and also toads but not mice can fall into state called clinical torpor when food shortage the induced hibernation can made work could useful the emergency management severely injured and the conservation donated hypothermia induced hydrogen sulfide for hours was shown reduce the extent brain damage caused experimental stroke mentioned hydrogen sulfide binds cytochrome oxidase and thereby prevents oxygen from which leads the dramatic slowdown metabolism animals and humans naturally produce some hydrogen sulfide their researchers have proposed that the gas used regulate metabolic activity and body which would explain the above two recent studies cast doubt that the effect can achieved larger study failed reproduce the effect concluding that the effects seen mice were not present larger likewise paper haouzi noted that there induction hypometabolism either the february ted conference mark roth announced that hydrogen sulfide induced hypothermia humans had completed phase clinical the clinical trials commissioned the company helped ikaria were however withdrawn terminated august participant the sulfur cycle sulfur cycle hydrogen sulfide central participant the sulfur cycle the biogeochemical cycle sulfur the absence oxygen sulfur reducing and sulfate reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen organic molecules reducing elemental sulfur sulfate hydrogen other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from containing amino acids this gives rise the odor rotten eggs and contributes the odor flatulence organic matter decays under oxygen hypoxic conditions such eutrophic lakes dead zones sulfate reducing bacteria will use the sulfates present the water oxidize the organic producing hydrogen sulfide some the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions the water produce metal which are not water these metal such ferrous sulfide fes are often black leading the dark color several groups bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide oxidizing elemental sulfur sulfate using dissolved metal oxides oxyhydroxides and nitrate the purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide electron donor photosynthesis thereby producing elemental this mode photosynthesis older than the mode cyanobacteria algae and plants which uses water electron donor and liberates mass extinctions bird eye view hydrogen sulfide has been implicated several mass extinctions that have occurred the buildup hydrogen sulfide the atmosphere may have caused the permian triassic extinction event million years organic residues from these extinction boundaries indicate that the oceans were anoxic and had species shallow plankton that metabolized the formation may have been initiated massive volcanic which emitted carbon dioxide and methane into the which warmed the lowering their capacity absorb oxygen that would otherwise oxidize the increased levels hydrogen sulfide could have killed generating plants well depleted the ozone causing further small blooms have been detected modern times the dead sea and the atlantic ocean off the coast see also amine gas
