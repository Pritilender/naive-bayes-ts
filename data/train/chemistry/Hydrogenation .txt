convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes and cycloalkanes which are less toxic and less for mineral turpentine usually hydrocracking heavy residues into diesel another isomerization and catalytic reforming processes some hydrogen pressure maintained hydrogenolyze coke formed the catalyst and prevent its hydrogenation useful reaction for converting more oxidized oxygen and nitrogen compounds such imines and nitriles into the corresponding saturated alcohols and primary alcohols can synthesized from aldehydes thus alkyl which can synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and can converted propanol produced from produced from ethene and carbon xylitol polyol produced hydrogenation the sugar xylose primary amines can synthesized hydrogenation nitriles while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and suitable for isophorone precursor the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate produced from isophorone nitrile tandem nitrile reductive amination wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another the food industry fats food unsaturated fat monounsaturated fat polyunsaturated fat trans fat omega saturated fat interesterified fat fatty acid essential fatty acid the largest scale application hydrogenation for the processing vegetable typical vegetable oils are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids containing more than one carbon double bonds their partial hydrogenation reduces most but not these carbon double the degree hydrogenation controlled restricting the amount reaction temperature and and the hydrogenation converts liquid vegetable oils into solid solid such those present margarine changing the degree saturation the fat changes some important physical properties such the melting which why liquid oils become solid solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces more desirable texture the baked because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal source are available wide range and have other desirable characteristics increased oxidative longer shelf they are the predominant fats used shortening most commercial baked health implications trans fat side effect incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health the isomerization some the remaining unsaturated carbon the cis configuration these double bonds predominates the unprocessed fats most edible fat but incomplete hydrogenation partially converts these molecules trans isomers which have been implicated circulatory diseases including heart disease the conversion from cis trans bonds favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis the cis isomer ratio about food legislation the and codes practice have long required labels declaring the fat content foods retail trade more have also required declaration the trans fat the use trans fats human food products has been effectively banned denmark since and switzerland the local legislation banned trans fats from restaurants and public kitchens new york city since and california other countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling trans fats food products and appealed the industry for voluntary hydrogenation coal bergius process history heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation the earliest hydrogenation that platinum catalyzed addition hydrogen oxygen the lamp device commercialized early the french chemist paul sabatier considered the father the hydrogenation building the earlier work james boyce american chemist working the manufacture soap discovered that the introduction trace nickel catalyst facilitated the addition hydrogen molecules gaseous hydrocarbons what now known the sabatier process for this work sabatier shared the nobel prize chemistry wilhelm normann was awarded patent germany and britain for the hydrogenation liquid which was the beginning what now world wide the commercially important haber bosch process first described involves hydrogenation the fischer tropsch process reported carbon which easily derived from hydrogenated liquid also voorhees and adams described apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one the parr the first product allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and was commercialized based voorhees and research and remains widespread murray raney developed nickel fine powder catalyst named after him which still widely used hydrogenation reactions such conversion nitriles amines the production homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation the history homogeneous hydrogenation has been assigned the development the meerwein verley reduction ketones using aluminium the calvin discovered that complexes oxidized the witnessed the development well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal wilkinson catalyst soon thereafter schrock and discovered that cationic and catalyze the hydrogenation alkenes and the asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated the synthesis dopa and the saw the invention noyori asymmetric hydrogenation the development homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced work started the and the oxo process and ziegler natta polymerization more homogeneous hydrogenation has been used promote reductive bond metal free hydrogenation for all practical hydrogenation requires metal hydrogenation however proceed from some hydrogen donors without illustrative hydrogen donors being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide some free catalytic systems have been investigated academic one such system for reduction ketones consists tert butanol and potassium butoxide and very high the reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation benzophenone chemical kinetics study found this reaction first order all three reactants suggesting cyclic membered transition state another system for free hydrogenation based the phosphine borane compound which has been called frustrated lewis pair reversibly accepts dihydrogen relatively low temperatures form the phosphonium borate which can reduce simple hindered imines the reduction nitrobenzene aniline has been reported catalysed fullerene its atmospheric hydrogen and equipment used for hydrogenation today bench chemist has three main choices hydrogenation batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions batch hydrogenation elevated temperature pressure flow hydrogenation batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions the original and still commonly practised form hydrogenation teaching this process usually effected adding solid catalyst round bottom flask dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen argon gas and sealing the mixture with penetrable rubber hydrogen gas then supplied from filled balloon the resulting three phase mixture agitated promote hydrogen uptake can which can useful for monitoring progress this achieved either using graduated tube containing coloured usually aqueous copper sulfate with gauges for each reaction batch hydrogenation elevated temperature pressure since many hydrogenation reactions such hydrogenolysis protecting groups and the reduction aromatic systems proceed extremely sluggishly atmospheric temperature and pressurised systems are these catalyst added solution reactant under inert atmosphere pressure vessel hydrogen added directly from cylinder built laboratory hydrogen and the pressurized slurry mechanically rocked provide spinning basket heat may also the pressure compensates for the associated reduction gas flow hydrogenation flow hydrogenation has become popular technique the bench and increasingly the process this technique involves continuously flowing dilute stream dissolved reactant over fixed bed catalyst the presence using established hplc technology this technique allows the application pressures from atmospheric psi elevated temperatures may also the bench systems use range packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering pyrophoric catalysts industrial reactors catalytic hydrogenation done tubular flow reactor packed with supported the pressures and temperatures are typically although this depends the catalyst loading typically much lower than laboratory batch and various promoters are added the mixed metals are improve selectivity and catalyst the use nickel common despite its low due its low cost compared precious gas liquid induction reactors are also used for carrying out catalytic see also carbon neutral fuel dehydrogenation transfer hydrogenation
