chemistry	iupac nomenclature inorganic chemistry inorganic nomenclature navigation search has been suggested that nomenclature inorganic chemistry merged into this discuss proposed since march iupac nomenclature inorganic chemistry the iupac nomenclature inorganic chemistry systematic method naming inorganic chemical compounds recommended the international union pure and applied chemistry the rules are commonly known the red ideally every inorganic compound should have name from which unambiguous formula can there also iupac nomenclature organic chemistry contents system traditional naming naming simple ionic compounds list common ion names naming hydrates naming molecular compounds revision nomenclature for inorganic compounds see also external links references system the names caffeine and dione both signify the same the systematic name encodes the structure and composition the caffeine molecule some and provides unambiguous reference this whereas the name caffeine just names these advantages make the systematic name far superior the common name when absolute clarity and precision are however for the sake even professional chemists will use the systematic name almost all the because caffeine known common chemical with unique similarly most often simply called water though other chemical names exist single atom anions are named with ide suffix for hydride compounds with positive ion cation the name the compound simply the name usually the same the followed the for nacl sodium chloride and caf calcium fluoride cations which have taken more than one positive charge are labeled with roman numerals for deprecated notation append ous the root the latin name name ions with lesser greater under this naming cuprous and for naming metal complexes see the page complex oxyanions polyatomic anions containing are named with ite ate for lesser greater quantity respectively for while four oxyanions are the prefixes hypo and per are hypochlorite clo perchlorate clo the prefix deprecated way indicating the presence single hydrogen ion sodium bicarbonate nahco the modern method specifically names the hydrogen atom thus nahco would pronounced sodium hydrogen positively charged ions are called cations and negatively charged ions are called the cation always named ions can metals polyatomic therefore the name the metal positive polyatomic ion followed the name the metal negative polyatomic the positive ion retains its element name whereas for single metal anion the ending changed example sodium potassium oxide calcium carbonate when the metal has more than one possible ionic charge oxidation number the name becomes ambiguous these cases the oxidation number the same the the metal ion represented roman numeral parentheses immediately following the metal ion for example fluoride the oxidation number uranium another example the iron feo oxide and oxide older system used prefixes and suffixes indicate the oxidation according the following thus the four oxyacids chlorine are called hypochlorous acid chlorous acid chloric acid hoclo and perchloric acid hoclo and their respective conjugate bases are the chlorite chlorate and perchlorate this system has partially fallen out but survives the common names many chemical compounds the modern literature contains few references ferric instead calling chloride but names like potassium instead potassium and sulfuric abound traditional naming naming simple ionic compounds ionic compound named its cation followed its see polyatomic ions for list possible for cations that take multiple the charge written using roman numerals parentheses immediately following the element for copper nitrate because the charge two nitrate ions and since the net charge the ionic compound must the ion has charge this compound therefore nitrate the case cations with oxidation the acceptable format for the roman numeral and not the roman numerals fact show the oxidation number but simple ionic compounds not metal complexes this will always equal the ionic charge the for simple overview see for more details see selected pages from iupac rules for naming inorganic compounds list common ion names monatomic chloride sulfide phosphide polyatomic ions ammonium hydronium nitrate nitrite hypochlorite chlorite chlorate perchlorate sulfite sulfate hydrogen sulfite bisulfite hydrogen carbonate bicarbonate carbonate phosphate hydrogen phosphate dihydrogen phosphate chromate dichromate borate arsenate oxalate cyanide thiocyanate permanganate naming hydrates hydrates are ionic compounds that have absorbed they are named the ionic compound followed numerical prefix and hydrate the numerical prefixes used are listed below see iupac numerical multiplier mono tri tetra penta hexa hepta octa nona deca for cuso sulfate naming molecular compounds inorganic molecular compounds are named with prefix see list before each the more electronegative element written last and with ide suffix for can called dihydrogen monoxide organic molecules not follow this the prefix mono not used with the first for sulfur dioxide not monosulfur sometimes prefixes are shortened when the ending vowel the prefix conflicts with starting vowel the this makes the name easier for carbon opposed monooxide revision nomenclature for inorganic compounds iupac nomenclature inorganic chemistry see also iupac
