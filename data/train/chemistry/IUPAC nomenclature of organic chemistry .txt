iupac nomenclature organic chemistry organic nomenclature navigation search the iupac nomenclature organic chemistry systematic method naming organic chemical compounds recommended the international union pure and applied chemistry ideally every possible organic compound should have name from which unambiguous structural formula can for ordinary spare tedious the official iupac naming recommendations are not always followed except when necessary give unambiguous and absolute definition when the iupac name simpler ethanol instead ethyl otherwise the common trivial name may often derived from the source the compound see very long names may less concise than structural contents basic principles alkanes alkenes and alkynes functional groups alcohols halogens alkyl ketones aldehydes carboxylic acids ethers esters amines and amides cyclic compounds order precedence groups common nomenclature trivial names ketones aldehydes ions hydron parent hydride cations cations and substitution see also references external links basic principles number prefixes suffixes and infixes are used describe the type and position functional groups the the steps naming organic compound identification the parent hydrocarbon chain this chain must obey the following order should have the maximum number substituents the suffix functional meant that the parent functional group should have unlike halogen more than one functional group the one with highest precedence should should have the maximum number multiple bonds should have the maximum number single should have the maximum identification the parent functional group with the highest order identification the side chains are the carbon chains that are not the parent but are branched off from identification the remaining functional and naming them the their ion names such hydroxy for oxy for oxyalkane for etc different chains and functional groups will grouped together alphabetical order the prefixes tri etc are not taken into consideration for grouping for ethyl comes before dihydroxy the ethyl precedes the dihydroxy and the dimethyl alphabetically the not considered either when both side chains and secondary functional groups are they should written mixed together one group rather than two separate identification triple numbering the this done first numbering the chain both directions left right and right and then choosing the numbering which follows these order has the numbered locant for the suffix functional locants are the numbers the carbons which the substituent directly has the numbered locants for multiple bonds the locant multiple bond the number the adjacent carbon with lower has the numbered locants for double has the numbered locants for numbering the various substituents and bonds with their there more than one the same type double prefix added showing how many there table tri tetra then for the number carbons below with added the numbers for that type side chain will grouped ascending order and written before the name the there are two chains with the same alpha carbon the number will written example there are both double bonds and triple double written before yne triple when the main functional group terminal functional group group which can only exist the end like formyl and carboxyl there need number arrangement this group side chains and secondary functional groups with numbers made step prefix parent hydrocarbon chain meth double triple bonds with numbers ane primary functional group suffix with wherever says with understood that between the word and the the tri adding commas are put between numbers becomes hyphens are put between number and letter trimethylheptane becomes successive words are merged into one word trimethyl heptane becomes iupac uses word names this why all parts are the finalized name should look like side secondary functional side tri secondary functional parent chain all bonds are single use ane double triple primary functional used for the group secondary functional groups and side chains may not look the same shown the side chains and secondary functional groups are arranged the and have been used just show their after tri after etc example here sample molecule with the parent carbons for here image the same where the hydrogens the parent chain are removed and the carbons are shown their now following the above the parent hydrocarbon chain has carbons called tricosa the functional groups with the highest precedence are the two ketone the groups are carbon atoms and there are write dione the numbering the molecule based the ketone when numbering from left the ketone groups are numbered and when numbering from right the ketone groups are numbered and less than therefore the ketones are numbered and the smaller number always not the sum the constituents the side chains carbon carbon and carbon the carbon atom not side but methoxy functional there are two groups they are combined diethyl the side chains are grouped like diethyl but this not the final functional groups may added the secondary functional groups carbon carbon carbon and carbon grouped with the side this gives methoxy there are two double one between carbons and and one between carbons and they would called but the presence alkynes switches dien there one triple bond between carbon atoms and will called yne the arrangement with dione due cis trans isomerism have specify the relative orientation functional groups around each double for this have the final name dione alkanes alkane chain alkanes take the suffix ane and are prefixed depending the number carbon atoms the following standard the first few for the simplest alkane methane and the carbon alkane named the names the first four alkanes were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively the rest are named with greek numeric with the exceptions nonane which has latin prefix and undecane and tridecane which have language cyclic alkanes are simply prefixed with for cyclobutane and branched alkanes are named chain alkane with attached alkyl groups they are prefixed with number indicating the carbon the group attached counting from the end the alkane for chch commonly known treated propane chain with methyl group bonded the middle carbon and given the systematic name however although the name methylpropane could easier and more logical call simply methylpropane the methyl group could not possibly occur any the other carbon atoms that would lengthen the chain and result not and therefore the use the number there ambiguity the position the depending which end the alkane chain counted then numbering chosen that the smaller number for chch named not there are multiple branches the same size alkyl their positions are separated commas and the group prefixed with tri tetra etc depending the number branches there are different they are added alphabetical separated commas the longest possible main alkane chain therefore methylhexane instead even though these describe equivalent the tri etc prefixes are ignored for the purpose alphabetical ordering side chains not alkenes and alkynes alkenes alkynes alkenes are named for their parent alkane chain with the suffix ene and infixed number indicating the position the bonded carbon the chch multiple double bonds take the form etc with the size prefix the chain taking extra simple cis and trans isomers may indicated with prefixed cis trans cis trans however cis and trans are relative descriptors iupac convention describe all alkenes using absolute descriptors same and with the cahn prelog priority rules alkynes are named using the same with the suffix yne indicating triple ethyne acetylene propyne methylacetylene functional groups functional group table common functional groups alcohols alcohols alcohols take the suffix with infix numerical bonding the suffixes diol triol tetraol etc are used for multiple ethylene glycol ohch higher precedence functional groups are present see order precedence below the prefix hydroxy used with the bonding chohcooh hydroxypropanoic halogens alkyl halogens halogen functional groups are prefixed with the bonding position and take the form chloro bromo iodo etc depending the multiple groups are trichloro etc and dissimilar groups are ordered alphabetically for chcl chloroform the anesthetic halothane ketones ketones general ketones take the suffix one pronounced own not won with infix position coch higher precedence suffix the prefix coch cho aldehydes aldehydes aldehydes take the suffix other functional groups are the chain numbered such that the aldehyde carbon the position unless functional groups higher precedence are prefix form used for with the position number indicating the end choch cooh oxopropanoic the carbon the carbonyl group cannot included the attached chain for instance the case cyclic aldehydes the prefix the suffix carbaldehyde cho aldehyde attached benzene and the main functional the suffix becomes carboxylic acids carboxylic acids general carboxylic acids are named with the suffix oic acid etymologically back formation from benzoic acid similar they take the position the parent but not have their position number for cooh valeric named pentanoic for common carboxylic acids some traditional names such acetic acid are such widespread use they are considered retained iupac names although systematic names such ethanoic acid are also for carboxylic acids attached benzene ring such these are named benzoic acid its there are multiple carboxyl groups the same parent the suffix carboxylic can used dicarboxylic tricarboxylic etc these the carbon the carboxyl group does not count being part the main alkane the same true for the prefix citric acid one named tricarboxylic rather than hydroxypentanedioic ethers ethers ethers consist oxygen atom between the two attached carbon the shorter the two chains becomes the first part the name with the ane suffix changed and the longer alkane chain becomes the suffix the name the thus och and och methoxyethane not ethoxymethane the oxygen not attached the end the main alkane then the whole shorter ether group treated chain and prefixed with its bonding position the main thus esters esters esters are named alkyl derivatives carboxylic the alkyl group named the part then named separate word based the carboxylic acid with the ending changed from oic acid oate for cooch methyl pentanoate and chch cooch ethyl methylpentanoate for esters such ethyl acetate cooch ethyl formate hcooch dimethyl phthalate that are based common iupac recommends use these established called retained names the oate changes ate some simple named both are shown the figure the alkyl group not attached the end the the bond position the ester group infixed before oocch may called propanoate citation needed amines and amides amine amide amines are named for the attached alkane chain with the suffix methyl the bonding position propan chnh propan the prefix form for secondary amines the form the longest carbon chain attached the nitrogen atom becomes the primary name the the other chain prefixed alkyl group with location prefix given italic nhch tertiary amines are treated again the substituent groups are ordered amides take the suffix the carbon the amide group cannot included the main the prefix form both and amides that have additional substituents the nitrogen are treated similarly the case they are ordered alphabetically with the location prefix hcon cyclic compounds cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds can treated the main parent chain the which case the position substituents are numbered around the ring for the three isomers xylene commonly the ortho meta and para forms are and the cyclic structures can also treated functional groups which case they take the prefix cyclo alkyl for the iupac nomenclature scheme becomes rapidly more elaborate for more complex cyclic with notation for compounds containing conjoined and many common names such phenol being accepted base names for compounds derived from order precedence groups when compounds contain more than one functional the order precedence determines which groups are named with prefix suffix the precedence group takes the with all others taking the prefix however double and triple bonds only take suffix form and and are used with other prefixed substituents are ordered alphabetically excluding any modifiers such tri etc chlorofluoromethane not fluorochloromethane there are multiple functional groups the same either prefixed the position numbers are ordered numerically thus not ethane the position indicator for amines and amides comes before functional group formula cations ammonium carboxylic

acetaldehyde ions the iupac nomenclature also provides rules for naming ions hydron hydron generic term for hydrogen protons deuterons and tritons are all the hydrons are not found heavier however parent hydride cations see also onium compounds simple cations formed adding hydron hydride chalcogen pnictogen are named adding the suffix the and ammonium was adopted instead which commonly refers the cationic center the hydride not chalcogen pnictogen then the suffix added the name the neutral hydride after dropping any final dioxidanium and diazanium cations and substitution the above cations except for methanium are strictly organic since they not contain however many organic cations are obtained substituting another element some functional group for the name each substitution prefixed
