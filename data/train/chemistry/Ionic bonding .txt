chemistry	ionic bonding ionic bond navigation search sodium fluorine sodium fluoride electron electron configuration exothermically ionic bonding type chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions these ions represent atoms that have lost one more electrons known cations and atoms that have gained one more electrons known anions the simplest the cation metal atom and the anion nonmetal atom but these ions can more complex molecular ions like important recognize that clean ionic bonding which one atom steals electron from another cannot all ionic compounds have some degree covalent bonding electron thus the term ionic given when the ionic character greater than the covalent that bond which large electronegativity difference exists between the two causing the bonding more polar than covalent bonding where electrons are shared more bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called polar covalent bonds ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten but typically not there are exceptions this such rubidium silver iodide where the silver ion can quite ionic compounds generally have high melting point depending the charge the ions they consist the higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting they also tend soluble here the opposite trend roughly the weaker the cohesive forces the greater the contents formation structures bond strength polarization effects comparison with covalent bonding electrical conductivity see also references external links formation ionic bonding can result from redox reaction when atoms element usually whose ionization energy release some their electrons achieve stable electron doing cations are the atom another element usually whose electron affinity then accepts the again attain stable electron and after accepting the atom becomes typically the stable electron configuration one the noble gases for elements the block and the block and particular stable electron configurations for block and block elements the electrostatic attraction between the anions and cations leads the formation solid with crystallographic lattice which the ions are stacked alternating such usually not possible distinguish discrete molecular that the compounds formed are not molecular however the ions themselves can complex and form molecular ions like the acetate anion the ammonium for common table salt sodium chloride when sodium and chlorine are the sodium atoms each lose electron forming cations and the chlorine atoms each gain electron form anions these ions are then attracted each other ratio form sodium chloride however maintain charge strict ratios between anions and cations are observed that ionic obey the rules stoichiometry despite not being molecular for compounds that are transitional the alloys and possess mixed ionic and metallic this may not the case many form stoichiometric many ionic compounds are referred salts they can also formed the neutralization reaction arrhenius base like naoh with arrhenius acid like hcl the salt nacl then said consist the acid rest and the base rest lithium fluorine lithium fluoride valence electron isoelectronic helium neon the removal electrons from the cation raising the overall there may also energy changes associated with breaking existing bonds the addition more than one electron form however the action the accepting the valence electrons and the subsequent attraction the ions each other releases energy thus lowers the overall energy the ionic bonding will occur only the overall energy change for the reaction the reaction but the formation mercuric oxide the charge the resulting ions major factor the strength ionic salt held together electrostatic forces roughly four times weaker than according coulombs where and represent generic cation and anion course the sizes the ions and the particular packing the lattice are ignored this simple structures ionic compounds the solid state form lattice the two principal factors determining the form the lattice are the relative charges the ions and their relative some structures are adopted number for the structure the rock salt sodium chloride also adopted many alkali halides and binary oxides such mgo bond strength lattice energy for solid crystalline ionic compound the enthalpy change forming the solid from gaseous ions termed the lattice energy the experimental value for the lattice energy can determined using the born haber cycle can also calculated using the born equation the sum the electrostatic potential energy calculated summing interactions between cations and and range repulsive potential energy the electrostatic potential can expressed terms the ionic separation and constant madelung constant that takes account the geometry the the born equation gives reasonable fit the lattice energy sodium where the calculated value which compares mol using the born haber cycle polarization effects ions crystal lattices purely ionic compounds are spherical however the positive ion small highly will distort the electron cloud the negative effect summarised fajans rules this polarization the negative ion leads extra charge density between the two nuclei partial larger negative ions are more easily but the effect usually important only when positive ions with charges are however ions even show some polarizing power because their sizes are small lii ionic but has some covalent bonding note that this not the ionic polarization effect that refers displacement ions the lattice due the application electric comparison with covalent bonding ionic the atoms are bound attraction opposite whereas covalent bonding atoms are bound sharing electrons attain stable electron covalent the molecular geometry around each atom determined valence shell electron pair repulsion vsepr rules whereas ionic the geometry follows maximum packing rules one could say that covalent bonding more directional the sense that the energy penalty for not adhering the optimum bond angles whereas ionic bonding has such there are shared electron pairs repel each the ions should simply packed efficiently this often leads much higher coordination each ion has neighbors and all bond angles are degrees cscl the coordination number comparison carbon typically has maximum four purely ionic bonding cannot the proximity the entities involved the bonding allows some degree sharing electron density between therefore all ionic bonding has some covalent thus bonding considered ionic where the ionic character greater than the covalent the larger the difference electronegativity between the two types atoms involved the the more ionic bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called polar covalent bonds for and interactions have few percent while bonds are usually ionic and covalent pauling estimated that electronegativity difference the pauling corresponds ionic that difference greater than corresponds bond which predominantly when ionic bonding occurs the solid state not possible talk about single ionic between two individual because the cohesive forces that keep the lattice together are more collective this quite different the case covalent where can often speak distinct bond localized between two particular however even ionic bonding combined with some the result not necessarily discrete bonds localized such the resulting bonding often requires description terms band structure consisting gigantic molecular orbitals spanning the entire thus the bonding the solid often retains its collective rather than localized when the difference electronegativity the bonding may then lead semimetal eventually metallic conductor with metallic electrical conductivity electrolyte ionic molten can conduct electricity because the ions these conditions are free move and carry electrons between the anode and the the solid however they typically cannot conduct because the electrons are held together too tightly for them however some ionic compounds can conduct electricity when this due migration the ions particular and themselves under the influence electric these compounds are known fast ion conductors see also coulomb law ionic potential linear combination atomic orbitals hybridization chemical polarity
