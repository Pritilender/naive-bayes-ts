number member group noble elements odorless tasteless noble gas krypton occurs trace amounts the atmosphere isolated fractionally distilling liquefied and often used with other rare gases fluorescent lamps krypton inert for most practical krypton like the other noble gases can used lighting and photography krypton light has large number spectral lines and high light output plasmas allows play important role many powered gas lasers krypton ion and excimer lasers which pick out one the many spectral lines there also specific krypton fluoride laser the high power and relative ease operation krypton discharge tubes caused from the official length meter defined terms the wavelength the spectral line contents history characteristics isotopes chemistry natural occurrence applications precautions see also references further reading external links history krypton was discovered britain sir william ramsay scottish and morris travers english residue left from evaporating nearly all components liquid neon was discovered similar procedure the same workers just few weeks william ramsay was awarded the nobel prize chemistry for discovery series noble gases including international agreement defined the meter terms wavelength light emitted the isotope wavelength nanometers this agreement replaced the longstanding standard meter located paris which was metal bar made platinum iridium alloy the bar was originally estimated one millionth quadrant the earth polar and was itself replaced definition based the speed light fundamental physical however the international conference weights and measures had redefined the meter terms red cadmium spectral line wavelengths october the same bureau defined the meter the distance that light travels vacuum during characteristics krypton characterized several sharp emission lines spectral signatures the strongest being green and one the products uranium fission solidified krypton white and crystalline with centered cubic crystal structure which common property all noble gases except helium with hexagonal packed crystal isotopes isotopes krypton naturally occurring krypton made six stable isotopes about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are the product atmospheric produced with the other naturally occurring isotopes being radioactive has half life years krypton highly volatile when near surface waters but has been used for dating old years groundwater inert radioactive noble gas with life years produced the fission uranium and plutonium such nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors released during the reprocessing fuel rods from nuclear concentrations the north pole are higher than the south pole due convective chemistry like the other noble krypton highly chemically however following the first successful synthesis xenon compounds synthesis krypton difluoride krf was reported before the noble gas compounds had been under extreme krypton reacts with fluorine form krf according the following the same krf was reported but was subsequently shown mistaken there are also unverified reports barium salt krypton oxoacid and polyatomic ions have been investigated and there evidence for krxe compounds with krypton bonded atoms other than fluorine have also been the reaction krf with otef produces unstable otef that contains oxygen bond nitrogen bond found the cation produced the reaction krf with asf below hkrcn and krypton cyanide and were reported stable natural occurrence the earth has retained all the noble gases that were present its formation except for helium krypton concentration the atmosphere about ppm can extracted from liquid air fractional distillation the amount krypton space the amount derived from the meteoric activity and that from solar the first measurements suggest overabundance krypton applications multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear which turn makes based bulbs useful photography brilliant white light krypton thus used some types photographic flashes used high speed photography krypton gas also combined with other gases make luminous signs that glow with bright yellow krypton mixes with argon the fill gas energy saving fluorescent this reduces their power unfortunately this also reduces their light output and raises their krypton costs about times much krypton along with also used fill incandescent lamps reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures used for the brighter light results which contains more blue than conventional krypton white discharge often used good effect colored gas discharge which are then simply painted stained other ways allow the desired color for neon type advertising signs where the letters appear differing colors are often entirely krypton also capable much higher light power density than neon the red spectral line and for this red lasers for power laser shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors which select out the red spectral line for laser amplification and rather than the more familiar neon which could never practically achieve the watt red laser light outputs needed for this krypton has important role production and usage the krypton fluoride laser the laser has been important the nuclear fusion energy research community confinement the laser has high beam short wavelength and the ability modify the spot size track imploding experimental particle physics liquid krypton used construct homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters notable example the calorimeter the experiment cern containing about tonnes liquid this usage since the cheaper liquid argon typically the advantage krypton over argon small moli radius which allows for excellent spatial resolution and low degree the other parameters relevant for calorimetry application radiation length density the sealed spark gap assemblies contained ignition exciters used some older jet engines contain very small amount obtain consistent ionization levels and uniform krypton has application magnetic resonance imaging for imaging may used distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces containing although xenon has potential for use computed tomography assess regional its anesthetic properties limit its fraction the breathing gas the use breathing mixture containing xenon and krypton comparable effectiveness for xenon while avoiding the unwanted effects high fraction xenon precautions krypton considered toxic asphyxiant krypton has narcotic potency seven times greater than breathing gas containing krypton and air would cause narcosis similar breathing air four times atmospheric this would comparable scuba diving depth see nitrogen narcosis and potentially could affect anyone breathing nevertheless that mixture would contain only oxygen and hypoxia would greater see also books view order collections articles krypton period elements noble gases chemical elements chemical elements sorted portals access related topics chemistry
