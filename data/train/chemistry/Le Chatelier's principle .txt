chemistry	principle navigation search chemistry principle also called chatelier principle the equilibrium can used predict the effect change conditions chemical equilibrium the principle named after henry louis chatelier and sometimes karl ferdinand braun who discovered can stated concentration temperature volume pressure this principle has variety depending upon the discipline using see homeostasis term commonly used biology common take principle more general roughly any change status quo prompts opposing reaction the responding system chemistry the principle used manipulate the outcomes reversible often increase the yield pharmacology the binding ligands the receptor may shift the equilibrium according thereby explaining the diverse phenomena receptor activation and economics the principle has been generalized help explain the price equilibrium efficient economic simultaneous equilibrium phenomena that are apparent contradiction principle can these can resolved the theory response reactions contents status physical law chemistry effect change concentration effect change temperature effect change pressure effect adding inert gas effect catalyst applications economics see also references bibliography external links status physical law principle qualitatively describes systems instantaneous the duration adjustment depends the strength the negative feedback the initial shock principle also states that when there external constraint behavioural shift the system occurs annul the effect that where shock initially induces positive feedback such thermal runaway the new equilibrium can far from the old and can take long time some dynamic systems the state cannot determined from the the principle typically used describe closed feedback but thermodynamically closed and isolated systems since the second law thermodynamics ensures that the disequilibrium caused instantaneous shock must have finite half life the principle has analogs throughout the entire physical chemistry effect change concentration changing the concentration chemical will shift the equilibrium the side that would reduce that change the chemical system will attempt partially oppose the change affected the original state the rate extent and yield products will altered corresponding the impact the this can illustrated the equilibrium carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas reacting form methanol suppose were increase the concentration the using can predict that the amount methanol will decreasing the total change are add species the overall the reaction will favor the side opposing the addition the likewise the subtraction species would cause the reaction fill the gap and favor the side where the species was this observation supported the collision theory the concentration the frequency successful collisions that reactant would increase allowing for increase forward and generation the even desired product not thermodynamically favored the product can obtained continuously removed from the solution effect change temperature the effect changing the temperature the equilibrium can made clear incorporating heat either reactant and assuming that increase temperature increases the heat content when the reaction exothermic puts energy heat included and when the reaction endothermic takes energy heat included hence whether increasing decreasing the temperature would favor the forward the reverse reaction can determined applying the same principle with concentration take for the reversible reaction nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas form ammonia because this reaction produces heat the temperature was the heat content the system would the system would consume some that heat shifting the equilibrium the thereby producing less more ammonia would produced the reaction was run lower but lower temperature also lowers the rate the practice the haber process the temperature set compromise value that allows ammonia made reasonable rate with equilibrium concentration that not too exothermic reactions increase temperature decreases the equilibrium constant whereas endothermic reactions increase temperature increases the principle applied changes concentration pressure can understood having have constant the effect temperature however involves change the equilibrium the dependence temperature determined the sign the theoretical basis this dependence given the van hoff equation effect change pressure changes pressure are attributable changes the equilibrium concentrations the products and reactants not directly depend the pressure subjected the however change pressure due change volume the system will shift the considering the reaction nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas form note the number moles gas the hand side and the number moles gas the hand when the volume the system the partial pressures the gases were decrease pressure increasing the equilibrium the above reaction will shift the because the reactant side has greater number moles than does the product the system tries counteract the decrease partial pressure gas molecules shifting the side that exerts greater similarly were increase pressure decreasing the equilibrium shifts the counteracting the pressure increase shifting the side with fewer moles gas that exert less the volume increased because there are more moles gas the reactant this change more significant the denominator the equilibrium constant expression causing shift thus increase system pressure due decreasing volume causes the reaction shift the side with the fewer moles decrease pressure due increasing volume causes the reaction shift the side with more moles there effect reaction where the number moles gas the same each side the chemical effect adding inert gas inert gas noble gas such helium one that does not react with other elements adding inert gas into phase equilibrium constant volume does not result this because the addition reactive gas does not change the partial pressures the other gases the while true that the total pressure the system the total pressure does not have any effect the equilibrium rather change partial pressures that will cause shift the however the volume allowed increase the the partial pressures all gases would decreased resulting shift towards the side with the greater number moles effect catalyst catalyst has effect speeds both forward and backward reactions here iron and molybdenum are but the two catalysts not affect the state hence catalyst has effect equilibrium applications economics similar concept also named after chatelier was introduced economist paul samuelson there the generalized chatelier principle for maximum condition economic equilibrium where all unknowns function are independently auxiliary constraints leaving initial equilibrium reduce the response parameter thus factor demand and supply elasticities are hypothesized lower the short run than the long run because the cost constraint the short see also homeostasis ion effect response reactions
