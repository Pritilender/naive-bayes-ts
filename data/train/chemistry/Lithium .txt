stone chemical element with symbol and atomic number silver white metal belonging the alkali metal group chemical under standard conditions the lightest metal and the least dense solid like all alkali lithium highly reactive and for this typically stored mineral oil when cut lithium exhibits metallic luster but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly dull silvery then black because its high reactivity lithium never occurs freely and only appears compounds which are usually ionic lithium occurs number pegmatitic minerals but due its solubility present ocean water and commonly obtained from brines and clays commercial lithium isolated electrolytically from mixture lithium chloride and potassium chloride the nuclei lithium verge since the two stable lithium isotopes found nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon all stable nuclides because its relative nuclear lithium less common the solar system than the first chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light atomic for related lithium has important links nuclear physics the transmutation lithium atoms helium was the first fully made nuclear reaction and lithium deuteride serves fusion fuel staged thermonuclear weapons lithium and its compounds have several industrial including resistant glass and ceramics high weight alloys used lithium batteries and lithium ion batteries these uses

links properties alkali metal atomic and physical like the other alkali metals lithium has single valence electron that easily given form cation because good conductor heat and electricity well highly reactive though the least reactive the alkali lithium low reactivity compared other alkali metals due the proximity its valence electron its nucleus the remaining two electrons are orbital and are much lower and therefore they not participate chemical lithium metal soft enough cut with when possesses white color that quickly changes gray due while has one the lowest melting points among all metals has the highest melting and boiling points the alkali lithium has very low density comparable with that pine the least dense all elements that are solids room the next lightest solid element being more than denser furthermore apart from helium and hydrogen less dense than any liquid being only dense liquid nitrogen note lithium can float the lightest hydrocarbon oils and one only three metals that can float the other two being sodium and potassium lithium coefficient thermal expansion twice that aluminium and almost four times that iron has the highest specific heat capacity any solid lithium superconductive below standard pressure and higher temperatures more than very high pressures gpa temperatures below lithium like undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations has rhombohedral crystal system with layer repeat higher temperatures transforms face centered cubic and then body centered cubic helium temperatures the rhombohedral structure the most multiple allotropic forms have been reported for lithium high lithium has specific heat capacity kilojoules per the highest all because lithium metal often used coolants for heat transfer applications chemistry and compounds lithium reacts with water but with noticeably less energy than other alkali metals the reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide aqueous because its reactivity with lithium usually stored under cover often petroleum jelly though the heavier alkali metals can stored more dense such mineral oil lithium not dense enough fully submerged these moist lithium rapidly tarnishes form black coating lithium hydroxide lioh and lithium nitride and lithium carbonate the result secondary reaction between lioh and butyllithium when placed over lithium compounds give off striking crimson but when burns strongly the flame becomes brilliant lithium will ignite and burn oxygen when exposed water water lithium flammable and potentially explosive when exposed air and especially though less than the other alkali metals the water reaction normal temperatures brisk but the hydrogen produced will not ignite its with all alkali lithium fires are difficult requiring dry powder fire specifically the class type see types extinguishing agents lithium the only metal which reacts with nitrogen under normal conditions lithium has diagonal relationship with magnesium element similar atomic and ionic radius chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation nitride reaction with the formation oxide and peroxide when burnt salts with similar solubilities and thermal instability the carbonates and the metal reacts with hydrogen gas high temperatures produce lithium hydride other known binary compounds include the halides lif licl libr lii and the sulfide the superoxide lio carbide many other inorganic compounds are where lithium combines with anions form various borates amides carbonate nitrate borohydride libh multiple organolithium reagents are known where there direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms effectively creating carbanion these are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles many these organolithium the lithium ions tend aggregate into symmetry clusters which relatively common for alkali lihe very weakly interacting van der waals has been detected very low lithium has also been found exhibit ferromagnetism its gaseous under certain isotopes isotopes lithium naturally occurring lithium composed two stable isotopes and the latter being the more abundant natural abundance both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon compared the next lighter and heavier helium and beryllium which means that alone among stable light lithium can produce net energy through nuclear fission the two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium result though very light atomic lithium less common the solar system than the first chemical seven radioisotopes have been the most stable being with half life and with life all the remaining radioactive isotopes have lives that are shorter than the lived isotope lithium which decays through proton emission and has life one the primordial elements more primordial nuclides produced big bang nucleosynthesis small amount both and are produced but are thought burned fast additional small amounts lithium both and may generated from solar cosmic rays hitting heavier and from early solar system and radioactive while lithium created stars during the stellar nucleosynthesis further burnt can also generated carbon stars lithium isotopes fractionate substantially during wide variety natural including mineral formation chemical metabolism and ion exchange lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron octahedral sites clay minerals where preferred resulting enrichment the light isotope processes hyperfiltration and rock the exotic known exhibit nuclear halo the process known laser isotope separation can used separate lithium nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics uses are major source artificial lithium with the light isotope being retained industry and military stockpiles such extent slightly but measurably change the ratios even natural such this has led unusual uncertainty the standardized atomic weight since this quantity depends the natural abundance ratios these occurring stable lithium they are available commercial lithium mineral occurrence chlorine crust astronomical nucleosynthesis according modern cosmological lithium both its stable isotopes and was among the elements synthesized the big bang though the amount lithium generated big bang nucleosynthesis dependent upon the number photons per baryon for accepted values the lithium abundance can and there cosmological lithium the older stars seem have less lithium than they and some younger stars have far the lack lithium older stars apparently caused the mixing lithium into the interior where furthermore lithium produced younger though transmutes into two atoms helium due collision with proton temperatures above million degrees celsius most stars easily attain this temperature their lithium more abundant than predicted generation for causes not yet completely though was one the three first elements together with helium and synthesized the big lithium together with beryllium and boron are markedly less abundant than other nearby this result the low temperature necessary destroy and lack common processes produce lithium also found brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange because lithium present less massive brown but destroyed hotter red dwarf stars its presence the spectra can used the lithium differentiate the

body fluids have been found contain lithium ranging from ppb marine organisms tend bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial not known whether lithium has physiological role any these but nutritional studies mammals have indicated its importance leading suggestion that classed essential trace element with rda observational studies reported suggested that naturally occurring lithium drinking water may increase human history petalite lialsi was discovered the brazilian chemist and statesman jos bonif cio andrada silva mine the island sweden however was not until that johan august arfwedson then working the laboratory the chemist jakob berzelius detected the presence new element while analyzing petalite this element formed compounds similar those sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble water and more alkaline berzelius gave the alkaline material the name lithion lithina from the greek word transliterated lithos meaning stone reflect its discovery solid opposed which had been discovered plant and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance animal named the metal inside the material lithium arfwedson later showed that this same element was present the minerals spodumene and lepidolite christian gmelin was the first observe that lithium salts give bright red color however both arfwedson and gmelin tried and failed isolate the pure element from its was not isolated until when william thomas brande obtained electrolysis lithium oxide process that had previously been employed the chemist sir humphry davy isolate the alkali metals potassium and brande also described some pure salts such the and estimating that lithia lithium oxide contained about metal estimated the atomic weight lithium around mol modern value larger quantities lithium were produced through the electrolysis lithium chloride robert bunsen and augustus matthiessen the discovery this procedure henceforth led commercial production beginning the german company metallgesellschaft which performed electrolysis liquid mixture lithium chloride and potassium chloride the production and use lithium underwent several drastic changes the first major application lithium was temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines similar applications world war and shortly this use was supported the fact that based soaps have higher melting point than other alkali and are less corrosive than calcium based the small market for lithium soaps and the lubricating greases based upon them was supported several small mining operations mostly the united the demand for lithium increased dramatically during the cold war with the production nuclear fusion weapons both and produce tritium when irradiated and are thus useful for the production tritium well form solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs the form lithium deuteride the united states became the prime producer lithium the period between the late and the the the stockpile lithium was roughly tonnes lithium the stockpiled lithium was depleted which was enough affect the measured atomic weight lithium many standardized and even the atomic weight lithium some natural lithium ion which had been contaminated lithium salts discharged from isotope separation which had found its way into ground lithium was used decrease the melting temperature glass and improve the melting behavior aluminium oxide when using the hall roult process these two uses dominated the market until the middle the after the end the nuclear arms race the demand for lithium decreased and the sale department energy stockpiles the open market further reduced but the several companies started extract lithium from brine which proved less expensive method than underground even pit most the mines closed shifted their focus other materials only the ore from zoned pegmatites could mined for competitive for the mines near kings north carolina closed before the turn the the use lithium ion
