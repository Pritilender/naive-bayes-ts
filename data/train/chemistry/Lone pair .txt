chemistry	lone pair navigation search lewis structure hydroxide chemistry lone pair valence electron pair which not shared with another atom and sometimes called non bonding pair lone pairs are found the outermost electron shell they can identified using lewis structure electron pairs are therefore considered lone pairs two electrons are paired but are not used chemical bonding thus the number lone pair electrons plus the number bonding electrons equals the total number valence electrons around lone pairs are concept used vsepr theory which explains the shapes they are also referred the chemistry lewis acids and bases however not all bonding pairs electrons are considered chemists lone examples are the transition metals where the bonding pairs not influence molecular geometry and are said stereochemically contents examples angle changes lone pairs and dipole moments unusual lone pairs see also references examples ammonia water hydrogen chloride single lone pair can found with atoms the nitrogen group such nitrogen ammonia two lone pairs can found with atoms the chalcogen group such oxygen water and the halogens can carry three lone pairs such hydrogen chloride vsepr theory the electron pairs the oxygen atom water form the vertices tetrahedron with the lone pairs two the four the bond angle with less than the predicted for tetrahedral angle and this can explained repulsive interaction between the lone angle changes the pairs often exhibit negative polar character with their high charge density and are located closer the atomic nucleus average compared the bonding pair the presence lone pair decreases the bond angle between the bonding pair due their high electric charge which causes great repulsion between the they are also used the formation dative bond for the creation the hydronium ion occurs when acids are dissolved water and due the oxygen atom donating lone pair the hydrogen ion this can seen more clearly when looked two more common molecules for carbon dioxide the oxygen atoms are opposite sides the whereas water there angle between the hydrogen atoms due the repulsive force the oxygen lone the hydrogens are pushed further point where the forces all electrons the hydrogen atom are equilibrium this illustration the vsepr theory lone pairs and dipole moments lone pairs can make contribution dipole moment has dipole moment the electronegativity nitrogen greater than that hydrogen the result that the bonds are polar with net negative charge the nitrogen atom and smaller net positive charge the hydrogen there also dipole associated with the lone pair and this reinforces the contribution made the polar covalent bonds dipole moment contrast has much lower dipole moment fluorine more electronegative than nitrogen and the polarity the bonds opposite that the bonds that the dipole due the lone pair opposes the bond resulting low molecular dipole unusual lone pairs stereochemically active lone pair also expected for divalent lead and tin ions due their formal electronic configuration the solid state this results the distorted metal coordination observed the litharge structure adopted both pbo and the formation these heavy metal lone pairs which was previously attributed atomic hybridization the metal and states has recently been shown have strong anion this dependence the electronic states the anion can explain why some divalent lead and tin materials such pbs and snte show stereochemical evidence the lone pair and adopt the symmetric rocksalt crystal molecular systems the lone pair can also result distortion the coordination ligands around the metal the lead lone pair effect can observed supramolecular complexes lead nitrate and study linked the lone pair lead poisoning lead ions the human metabolism replace native metallic ions several key for zinc cations the alad which also known porphobilinogen synthase this seems the molecular basis lead saturnism plumbism computational experiments reveal that although the coordination number does not change upon substitution binding the introduction lead distorts the way the ligands organize themselves accommodate such emerging lone consequently these proteins are this pair effect becomes dramatic for binding such the mentioned porphobilinogen the natural substrate cannot bind those cases the protein inhibited group lone pairs manifest themselves triple bonds the familiar alkynes have bond order with bond angles but going down the row germanium germanium formal triple bonds have effective bond order with one lone pair and bent lead the bond order even with lone pairs for each lead atom the organogermanium compound the bond order also with complexation the acidic isonitrile groups based interaction with germaniums empty orbital see also lone pair ligand coordination complex highest occupied molecular orbital inert pair effect shared pair
