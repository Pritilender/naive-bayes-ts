photochemical the absorption ultraviolet light organic molecules very often leads the earliest days sunlight was employed while more modern times ultraviolet lamps are organic photochemistry has proven very useful synthetic complex organic products can obtained over the last century and earlier immense number photochemical reactions have been modern times the field quite well understood and used organic synthesis and the utility organic photochemistry has arisen only virtue the available mechanistic reactions which appear unlikely state understanding become understandable and accessible terms electronic state contents history diphenylcyclohexadienone rearrangement the contrasting case one double bond missing reactivity parallel studies the role triplets further the subsequent years common organic photochemical reactions references history one the earliest photochemical studies dealt with the natural product the century had been observed ciamician that italian sunlight santonin gave several the structure santonin was first correctly described clemo and hayworth the initial photoproduct obtained from santonin depicted the photoreaction involves rearrangement using steroid note that the carbonyl group has moved the methyl has moved and the carbon has been comparatively bizarre example was uncovered egbert havinga the curious result was activation photolysis meta nitro group contrast the usual activation ortho and para over the many interesting but puzzling organic photochemical reactions were discovered that did not proceed ordinary organic ground state processes rather they arose from the excited states electrons the the real problem was the organic chemists were not versed quantum mechanics and physical chemists were not versed organic real mechanistic treatments were not starting was found that one could understand organic photochemical reactions the context the relevant excited one example the excitation carbonyl the simplest being that the structure was first described the dimensional representation top simplified the second line using dimensional which facilitates arrow pushing this early research simple ckel computations were used get excited state electron densities and the stereochemistry scheme shown the ckel computations revealed that the carbons and the cyclohexadienone ring had large seen the scheme beta bond subsequent radiationless decay leads zwitterion ground the final rearrangement leads lumisantonin can discerned comparing the dimensional drawing with the earlier dimensional scheme the santonin lumisantonin rearrangement dimensions diphenylcyclohexadienone rearrangement quite parallel the santonin lumisantonin example the rearrangement diphenylcyclohexadienone here the triplet excited state undergoes the same beta this followed intersystem crossing isc form the singlet ground state which seen zwitterion the final step the rearrangement the bicyclic the reaction termed the type cyclohexadienone the contrasting case one double bond missing provide further evidence the mechanism the dienone which there bonding between the two double the case diphenylcyclohexenone presented seen that the rearrangement quite thus two double bonds are required for type with one double bond one the phenyl originally has migrated the beta considerable interest that when one the aryl groups has cyano methoxy that substituted aryl group migrates inspection the alternative type which aryl group has begun migrate the reveals the greater electron delocalization with substituent para the migrating aryl group and thus more stabilized reactivity still another type photochemical reaction the methane rearrangement two further early examples were the rearrangement pentadiene the mariano molecule and the rearrangement barrelene semibullvalene note contrast the cyclohexadienone reactions which used excited the methane rearrangements utilize excited parallel studies the role triplets parallel the structural studies the zimmerman group described the caltech group with george hammond pursued the role multiplicity the importance triplet excited species was the triplets tend longer lived than singlets and lower energy than the singlet the same hammond had summarized the energies triplets the more common noted that triplets may arise from conversion the initially formed singlets interaction with higher energy triplet another contribution hammond was the determination triplet reaction finally with energy triplets present was shown possible quench triplet the groundwork had been laid very earlier studies russia terenin and who demonstrated intermolecular triplet transfer low temperatures and described the further the subsequent years after the basics had been established organic photochemistry seemed accelerate the caltech group george hammond had remarkable group researchers including nicholas turro angelo peter jack robert angelo lamola and number nicholas turro the most prolific and highly cited the pioneers modern organic his modern molecular considered the bible the highly influential aspect work involved applying the paradigms photochemistry more complex environments relative small molecule phase experiments including supramolecular interfaces restricted spaces and biological common organic photochemical reactions among the more common organic photochemical reactions there are the norrish type the norrish type the racemization optically active the type cyclohexadienone the type cyclohexenone the methane rearrangement the type hexanone rearrangement photochemical electrocyclic processes the rearrangement epoxyketones ring opening cyclopropyl heterolysis dimethoxylbenzylic and photochemical cyclizations some these have been described above and with this being encyclopedic survey only selected few are considered
