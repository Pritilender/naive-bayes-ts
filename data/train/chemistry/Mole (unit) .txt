celebrate october reference the part mole day the mole widely used chemistry instead units mass volume convenient way express amounts reactants products chemical for the chemical equation implies that mol dihydrogen and mol dioxygen react form mol water the mole may also used express the number ions other elementary entities given sample any the concentration solution commonly expressed its molarity defined the number moles the dissolved substance per litre the number molecules mole known defined such that the mass one mole expressed exactly equal the mean molecular mass for the mean molecular mass natural water about one mole water about making use this equation considerably simplifies many chemical and physical the term gram molecule was formerly used for essentially the same the term gram atom abbreviated gat has been used for related but distinct namely quantity substance that contains number atoms whether isolated combined thus for mole mgb molecule mgb but atoms mgb

related concepts the mole defined bipm the amount substance system which contains many elementary entities atoms molecules ions electrons there are atoms kilograms carbon the isotope carbon with relative atomic mass thus one mole pure has mass exactly also follows from the definition that moles any substance will contain the same number molecules moles any other the mass per mole substance called its molar mass since the standard unit for expressing the mass molecules atoms atomic mass unit the dalton defined the mass follows that the molar mass measured grams per exactly equal its mean molecular atomic mass measured unified atomic mass units which the mean molecular relative atomic mass the number elementary entities sample substance technically called its amount therefore the mole convenient unit for that physical one can determine the chemical amount known dividing the mass the molar other methods include the use the molar volume the measurement electric charge the mass one mole substance depends not only its molecular formula but also the proportion the isotopes each element present for one mole calcium grams whereas one mole calcium grams and one mole calcium with the normal isotopic mix since the definition the gram not mathematically tied that the atomic mass the number molecules mole must determined the value adopted codata the measurement was refined history the history the mole intertwined with that molecular mass atomic mass unit avogadro number and related the first table relative atomic mass atomic was published john dalton based system which the relative atomic mass hydrogen was defined these relative atomic masses were based the stoichiometric proportions chemical reactions and fact that greatly aided their was not necessary for chemist subscribe atomic theory unproven hypothesis the make practical use the this would lead some confusion between atomic masses promoted proponents atomic and equivalent weights promoted its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses integer which would last throughout much the nineteenth jacob berzelius was instrumental the determination relative atomic masses increasing was also the first chemist use oxygen the standard which other masses were oxygen useful unlike forms compounds with most other especially metals however chose fix the atomic mass oxygen innovation that did not catch charles ric gerhardt henri victor regnault and stanislao cannizzaro expanded works resolving many the problems unknown stoichiometry and the use atomic masses attracted large consensus the time the karlsruhe congress the convention had reverted defining the atomic mass hydrogen although the level precision measurements that time relative uncertainties around this was numerically equivalent the later standard oxygen however the chemical convenience having oxygen the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass developments mass spectrometry led the adoption oxygen the standard lieu natural citation needed the current definition the based was approved during the the four different definitions were equivalent within the name mole translation the german unit mol coined the chemist wilhelm ostwald from the german word molek molecule however the related concept equivalent mass had been use least century the mole was made the seventh base unit the the mole unit since its adoption into the international system units there have been number criticisms the concept the mole unit like the metre the second the number etc given lump material fixed dimensionless quantity that can expressed simply does not require its own base the thermodynamic mole irrelevant analytical chemistry and could cause avoidable costs advanced the mole not true metric measuring unit rather parametric unit and amount substance parametric base the defines numbers entities quantities dimension and thus ignores the ontological distinction between entities and units continuous quantities has been known since proust law definite proportions that knowledge the mass each the components chemical system not sufficient define the amount substance can described mass divided definite and contains information that missing from the measurement mass demonstrated dalton law partial pressures measurement mass not even necessary measure the amount substance although practice there are many physical relationships between amount substance and other physical the most notable one being the ideal gas law where the relationship was first demonstrated the term mole was first used textbook describing these colligative properties other units called mole chemical engineers use the concept but the unit rather small for industrial for convenience avoiding some american engineers adopted the pound mole noted mol lbmol which defined the number entities lbm one mol equal mol the metric chemical engineers once used the kilogram mole noted mol which defined the number entities and often referred the mole the gram mole noted mol when dealing with laboratory however modern chemical engineering practice use the kilomole which identical the but whose name and symbol adopt the convention for standard multiples metric concentrations expressed are the same numbers those molarity conventionally used chemists for bench which convenient for proposed future definition new definitions the meeting the general conference weights and measures agreed plan for possible revision the base unit definitions yet undetermined this set forward the first included proposal redefine the mole way that will fix the avogadro constant equal exactly when expressed the unit mol related units the units for molar concentration are however most chemical literature traditionally uses mol which the same these traditional units are often denoted capital letter pronounced molar sometimes preceded prefix
