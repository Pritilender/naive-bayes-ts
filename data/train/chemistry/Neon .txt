conditions with about thirds the density was discovered along with krypton and xenon one the three residual rare inert elements remaining dry after nitrogen oxygen argon and carbon dioxide are neon was the second these three rare gases and was immediately recognized new element from its bright red emission spectrum the name neon derived from the greek neuter singular form neos meaning neon chemically inert and forms uncharged chemical during cosmic nucleogenesis the large amounts neon are built from the capture fusion process although neon very common element the universe and solar system fifth cosmic abundance after hydrogen helium oxygen and carbon very rare composes about ppm air volume this about the same the molecular mole and smaller fraction the reason for relative scarcity earth and the inner planets that neon forms compounds fix and highly volatile therefore escaping from the planetesimals under the warmth the newly ignited sun the early solar even the atmosphere jupiter somewhat depleted presumably for this neon gives distinct orange glow when used either voltage neon glow lamps voltage discharge tubes neon advertising signs the red emission line from neon also responsible for the well known red light helium neon lasers neon used few plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial commercially extracted the fractional distillation liquid air considerably more expensive than since air its only contents history isotopes characteristics occurrence applications compounds see also references external links history gas discharge lamps neon greek neuter singular form meaning new was discovered the british chemists sir william ramsay and morris travers england neon was discovered when ramsay chilled sample air until became then warmed the liquid and captured the gases they boiled the gases nitrogen oxygen and argon had been but the remaining gases were isolated roughly their order week period beginning the end may first identified was krypton the after krypton had been was gas which gave brilliant red light under spectroscopic this identified was named the greek analogue novum the name son the characteristic brilliant orange color that emitted gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted travers later the blaze crimson light from the tube told its own story and was sight dwell upon and never finally the same team discovered xenon the same neon scarcity precluded its prompt application for lighting along the lines moore tubes which used nitrogen and which were commercialized the early after georges claude air liquide was producing industrial quantities neon byproduct his air liquefaction december claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based sealed tube claude tried briefly get neon tubes used for indoor due their but homeowners rejected neon light sources due their finally claude associate began selling neon discharge tubes advertising signs where they were instantly more successful eye they were introduced the when two large neon signs were bought los angeles packard car the glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the neon played role the basic understanding the nature atoms when thomson part his exploration into the composition canal rays channeled streams neon ions through magnetic and electric field and measured their deflection placing photographic plate their thomson observed two separate patches light the photographic plate see which suggested two different parabolas thomson eventually concluded that some the atoms the neon gas were higher mass than the though not understood the time this was the first discovery isotopes stable atoms was made using crude version instrument now term mass spectrometer isotopes isotopes neon thomson neon the second lightest inert neon has three stable isotopes and and are partly primordial and partly nucleogenic made nuclear reactions other nuclides with neutrons other particles the and their variations natural abundance are well the chief primordial isotope made stellar nucleosynthesis not known nucleogenic radiogenic save for cluster decay production which thought produce only small the causes the variation the earth have thus been hotly the principal nuclear reactions which generate nucleogenic neon isotopes start from and which produce and respectively after neutron capture and immediate emission alpha particle the neutrons that produce the reactions are mostly produced secondary spallation reactions from alpha particles turn derived from uranium series decay chains the net result yields trend towards lower and higher ratios observed rich rocks such granites neon may also produced nucleogenic when absorbs neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron isotopic analysis exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic cosmic production this isotope generated spallation reactions magnesium sodium silicon and aluminium analyzing all three the cosmogenic component can resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic this suggests that neon will useful tool determining cosmic exposure ages surface rocks and meteorites similar xenon neon content observed samples volcanic gases enriched well nucleogenic relative the neon isotopic content these derived samples represents atmospheric source the enriched components are attributed exotic primordial rare gas components the possibly representing solar neon elevated abundances are found diamonds further suggesting solar neon reservoir the characteristics neon the lightest noble after helium glows orange vacuum discharge tube also neon has the narrowest liquid range any from has over times the refrigerating capacity liquid helium and three times that liquid hydrogen per unit volume most applications less expensive refrigerant than neon plasma has the most intense light discharge normal voltages and currents all the noble the average color this light the human eye orange due many lines this also contains strong green line which unless the visual components are dispersed two quite different kinds neon lighting are common neon glow lamps are generally with most operating about volts they have been widely used indicators and testing but light emitting diodes now dominate such these simple neon devices were the forerunners plasma displays and plasma television screens neon signs typically operate much higher voltages kilovolts and the luminous tubes are commonly meters the glass tubing often formed into shapes and letters for signage well architectural and artistic occurrence stable isotopes neon are produced created fusing helium and oxygen the alpha process which requires temperatures above mega kelvins and masses greater than solar neon abundant universal the fifth most abundant chemical element the universe after helium oxygen and carbon see chemical element its relative rarity like that due its relative high vapor pressure very low and chemical all properties which tend keep from being trapped the condensing gas and dust clouds which resulted the formation smaller and warmer solid planets like neon making lighter than the molecules diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk balloon filled with neon will rise albeit more slowly than helium mass abundance the universe about part and the sun and presumably the solar system about part the galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found that even the upper atmosphere the abundance neon reduced about factor level part this may indicate that even the planetesimals which brought neon into jupiter from the outer solar formed region which was too warm for them have kept their neon abundances heavier inert gases jupiter are several times that found the neon rare found the earth atmosphere part ppm volume this about the same the molecule mole part air comprises smaller fraction the industrially produced cryogenic fractional distillation liquefied applications neon signs neon often used signs and produces unmistakable bright orange although still referred neon other colors are generated with different noble gases varied colors fluorescent lighting neon used vacuum tubes high voltage lightning arrestors wave meter television and helium neon lasers liquefied neon commercially used cryogenic refrigerant applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more extreme liquid helium both neon gas and liquid neon are relatively for small the price liquid neon can more than times that liquid the driver for expense the rarity which unlike can only obtained from the triple point temperature neon defining fixed point the international temperature scale compounds neon the first block noble neon
