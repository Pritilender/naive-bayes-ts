chemistry	network covalent bonding network solids navigation search network solid covalent network solid chemical compound which the atoms are bonded covalent bonds continuous network solid there are individual molecules and the entire crystal may considered macromolecule formulas for network solids those for ionic compounds are simple ratios the component atoms represented formula unit examples network solids include diamond with continuous network carbon atoms and silicon dioxide quartz with continuous dimensional network sio units graphite and the mica group silicate minerals structurally consist continuous dimensional layers covalently bonded within the layer with other bond types holding the layers properties electrical conductivity poor there are delocalized when unlike ionic the substance still unable conduct electricity the macromolecule consists uncharged not ions seen previously mentioned ionic which also contrary most forms metallic graphite allotrope this each atom carbon forms three covalent leaving one electron each outer orbital creating multiple free within each plane this grants graphite electrical melting high due the large amount energy required rearrange the covalent hardness hard due the strong covalent bond throughout the lattice the layers carbon atoms graphite can easily allowing the substance solubility generally insoluble any solvent due the difficulty solvating very large covalent bond the chemical bond which involves the sharing pairs electrons between the stable balance attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons known covalent examples boron nitride diamond graphite quartz sio silicon carbide sic
