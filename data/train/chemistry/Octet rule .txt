chemistry	octet rule navigation search carbon dioxide octet rule the octet rule chemical rule thumb that states that atoms main group elements tend combine such way that each atom has eight electrons its valence shell giving the same electronic configuration noble gas the rule especially applicable carbon nitrogen oxygen and the halogens but also metals such sodium magnesium the valence electrons can counted using lewis electron dot diagram shown the right for carbon the electrons shared the two atoms covalent bond are counted once for each carbon dioxide each oxygen shares four electrons with the central two shown from the oxygen itself and two shown from the all these four electrons are counted both the carbon octet and the oxygen contents example sodium chloride history explanation quantum theory exceptions hypervalent molecules see also references sodium chloride ionic bonding common between pairs where one the pair metal low electronegativity such sodium and the second nonmetal high electronegativity such chlorine chlorine atom has seven electrons its outer electron the first and second shells being filled with two and eight electrons the first electron affinity chlorine the energy release when chlorine gains per mole chlorine adding second electron chlorine requires energy that cannot recovered formation chemical the result that chlorine will very often form compound which has eight electrons its outer shell complete sodium atom has single electron its outermost electron the first and second shells again being full with two and eight electrons remove this outer electron requires only the first ionization energy which per mole sodium small amount the second electron resides the deeper second electron and the second ionization energy required for its removal much per thus sodium most form compound which has lost single electron and have full outer shell eight the energy required transfer electron from sodium atom chlorine atom the difference the ionization energy sodium and the electron affinity mol this energy easily offset the lattice energy sodium chloride mol this completes the explanation the octet rule this history the late century was known that coordination compounds formerly called molecular were formed the combination atoms molecules such manner that the valencies the atoms involved apparently became alfred werner showed that the number atoms groups associated with central atom the coordination number often other coordination numbers maximum were but less richard abegg was one the first extend the concept coordination number concept valence which distinguished atoms electron donors leading positive and negative valence states that greatly resemble the modern concept oxidation states abegg noted that the difference between the maximum positive and negative valences element under his model frequently gilbert lewis referred this insight abegg rule and used help formulate his cubical atom model and the rule which began distinguish between valence and valence electrons irving langmuir refined these concepts further and renamed them the cubical octet and octet the octet evolved into what now known the octet explanation quantum theory the quantum theory the atom explains the eight electrons closed shell with electron shell configuration one which lying energy levels are full and higher energy levels are for example the neon atom ground state has full shell and empty shell according the octet the atoms immediately before and after neon the periodic table and tend attain similar configuration losing sharing the argon atom has analogous configuration there also empty but considerably higher energy than and unlike the hydrogen that still considered closed shell for chemical the atoms immediately before and after argon tend attain this configuration there however some hypervalent molecules which the level may play part the although this controversial see for helium there level according the quantum that closed shell with the atoms before and after helium and follow duet rule and tend have the same configuration exceptions the duet rule the first the noble gas helium has two electrons its outer which very since there subshell followed immediately and thus shell can only have most valence hydrogen only needs one additional electron attain this stable while lithium needs lose free radicals chlorine radical responsible for ozone depletion carbenes have incomplete valence these molecules often react complete their certain compounds that have odd number electrons nitric oxide obtain octet configurations means three electron bond ground state which universally represented obeying the octet actually contains two such for transition metals some classes molecule tend obey the electron rule which corresponds the utilization shell and orbitals form bonding and bonding however newer theoretical treatments support model with the dodectet rule electrons using only and valence the exclusion orbitals for transition metal atoms analogous the exclusion orbitals for hypervalent molecules main group see next hypervalent molecules hypervalent molecule group elements the third and later rows the periodic table can form hypercoordinate hypervalent molecules which the central group atom bonded more than four other such phosphorus pentachloride pcl and sulfur hexafluoride for example pcl supposed that there are five true covalent bonds which five distinct electron pairs are then the phosphorus would surrounded valence electrons violation the octet the early days quantum pauling proposed that row atoms can form five bonds using one three and one six bonds using one three and two form five the one three and one orbitals combine form five hybrid orbitals which each share electron pair with halogen for total shared two more than the octet rule similarly form six the six hybrid orbitals form six bonds with shared this model the availability empty orbitals used explain the fact that row atoms such phosphorus and sulfur can form more than four covalent whereas row atoms such nitrogen and oxygen are strictly limited the octet however other models describe the bonding using only and orbitals agreement with the octet one valence bond description uses resonance between different structures that each bonded covalent bond four structures and ionic bond one each resonance structure has eight valence electrons molecular orbital theory description considers the three equatorial bonds true covalent while the two axial bonds form three center electron bond with two electrons bonding molecular orbital and two bonding the bonding orbital localized the two axial again there are only eight valence electrons the the validity the octet rule for hypervalent molecules further supported initio molecular orbital calculations which show that the contribution functions the bonding orbitals see also lewis structure electron counting electron rule
