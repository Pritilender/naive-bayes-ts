chemistry	oxidation state navigation search the oxidation state often called the oxidation number indicator the degree oxidation atom chemical compound the formal oxidation state the hypothetical charge that atom would have all bonds atoms different elements were ionic oxidation states are typically represented integers which can negative some the average oxidation state element such for iron magnetite the highest known oxidation state the tetroxides ruthenium xenon osmium iridium hassium plutonium and curium while the lowest known oxidation state for some elements the carbon group the possibility and oxidation states platinum group especially iridium and discussed the problem oxidation state stabilisation and some regularities periodic system the yurii kiselev and yurii tretiyakov chem rev the increase oxidation state atom through chemical reaction known decrease oxidation state known reduction such reactions involve the formal transfer net gain electrons being reduction and net loss electrons being for pure the oxidation state there are various methods for determining oxidation inorganic nomenclature the oxidation state determined and expressed oxidation number represented roman numeral placed after the element coordination oxidation number defined differently from oxidation contents iupac definitions oxidation state and oxidation number oxidation state

the oxidation number concept oxidation number versus oxidation state see also references iupac definitions oxidation state and oxidation number oxidation state iupac technical report toward comprehensive definition oxidation has been the current gold book definition oxidation state listed iupac oxidation defined the charge atom might imagined have when electrons are counted according upon set the oxidation state free element uncombined zero for simple ion the oxidation state equal the net charge the ion hydrogen has oxidation state and oxygen has oxidation state when they are present most exceptions this are that hydrogen has oxidation state hydrides active lih and oxygen has oxidation state peroxides the algebraic sum oxidation states all atoms neutral molecule must while ions the algebraic sum the oxidation states the constituent atoms must equal the charge the oxidation number naming inorganic compounds the nomenclature inorganic compounds the oxidation number represented roman numeral the oxidation number equal the oxidation state using the although they acknowledge other methods can oxidation numbers must positive negative fractional oxidation numbers should not used and the event any uncertainty alternative naming conventions should oxidation number used coordination chemistry the current definition the oxidation number listed iupac central atom coordination the charge would bear all the ligands were removed along with the electron pairs that were shared with the central represented roman use nomenclature older literature the term referred stock number however the use this term longer recommended iupac the oxidation state compound naming placed either right superscript the element symbol chemical for example parentheses after the name the iron chemical for example named iron sulfate and its formula can shown this because sulfate ion has charge each iron atom takes charge note that fractional oxidation numbers should not used determining the oxidation state number there are two different methodologies for determining the oxidation state elements chemical first based approach determine how the electrons are allocated and this method based the rules the iupac and this approach widely second based the relative electronegativity the elements the where simple terms the more electronegative element assumed take the negative rule based method there are general rules adopted iupac for determining the oxidation states atoms simple chemical compounds without the use structural oxidation defined the charge atom might imagined have when electrons are counted according upon set the oxidation state free element uncombined zero for simple ion the oxidation state equal the net charge the ion hydrogen has oxidation state and oxygen has oxidation state when they are present most exceptions this are that hydrogen has oxidation state hydrides active lih and oxygen has oxidation state peroxides the algebraic sum oxidation states all atoms neutral molecule must while ions the algebraic sum the oxidation states the constituent atoms must equal the charge the simple examples any pure even forms diatomic molecules like chlorine has oxidation state examples this are for monatomic the oxidation state the same the charge the for the sulfide anion has oxidation state whereas the lithium cation has oxidation state the sum oxidation states for all atoms molecule polyatomic ion equal the charge the molecule thus the oxidation state one element can calculated from the oxidation states the other application this rule that the sum the oxidation states all atoms neutral molecule must consider neutral molecule carbon dioxide oxygen assumed have its usual oxidation state and the sum the oxidation states all the atoms can expressed where the unknown oxidation state thus can seen that the oxidation state carbon the molecule polyatomic the sum the oxidation states the constituent atoms must equal the charge the consider the sulfate anion which has the formula indicated the the total charge this ion because all four oxygen atoms are assumed have their usual oxidation state and the sum the oxidation states all the atoms equal the charge the the sum the oxidation states can represented where the unknown oxidation state sulfur thus can computed that these combined with some elements almost always having certain oxidation states due their very high electropositivity electronegativity allows one compute the oxidation states for the remaining atoms such transition metals simple example for complex salt oxygen has oxidation state fluorine bonds and hydrogen has state bonded each the three hydroxide groups has oxidation state the compound chromium has oxidation state using electronegativity the use electronegativity this way was introduced pauling this method determining oxidation state found some recent text this method allows the oxidation state all atoms molecule determined whereas the iupac definition does the rules iupac recommended that oxidation state was used nomenclature and elsewhere inorganic chemistry the charge that would present atom the electrons were assigned the more electronegative but with convention that hydrogen considered positive combination with metals and bond between like atoms makes contribution the oxidation practise the iupac definition usually extended adding additional rules based fluorine has oxidation state when bonded any other since has the highest electronegativity all reactive halogens other than fluorine have oxidation state except when they are bonded another halogen that more for the oxidation state chlorine chlorine monofluoride however bromine monochloride the oxidation state hydrogen has oxidation state except when bonded more electropositive elements such sodium aluminium and boron nah nabh lialh where each has oxidation state oxygen typically has oxidation state though there are exceptions that are listed below such peroxides hydrogen peroxide where oxygen has alkali metals have oxidation state virtually all their compounds see alkalide alkaline earth metals have oxidation state virtually all their ionic compounds ionic compound has two ions with common such ammonium nitrate usual consider the oxidation states for each ion the overall empirical formula ammonium nitrate which leads average nitrogen oxidation state but much more useful consider separately the ions and with nitrogen oxidation states and respectively calculation formal oxidation states with lewis structure this method can used for molecules when one has lewis structure should remembered that the oxidation state atom does not represent the real charge that this particularly true high oxidation where the ionization energy required produce multiply positive ion are far greater than the energies available chemical the assignment electrons between atoms calculating oxidation state purely but useful one for the understanding many chemical for more about issues with calculating atomic see partial charge the lewis structure when lewis structure molecule the oxidation states may assigned computing the difference between the number valence electrons that neutral atom that element would have and the number electrons that belong the lewis for purposes computing oxidation electrons bond between atoms different elements belong the more electronegative atom electrons bond between atoms the same element are split and electrons lone pair belong only the atom with the lone for consider acetic acid the methyl group carbon atom has valence electrons from its bonds the hydrogen atoms because carbon more electronegative than also electron gained from its bond with the other carbon atom because the electron pair the bond split giving total electrons neutral carbon atom would have valence because carbon group the periodic the the oxidation state that carbon that assumed that all the bonds were ionic which fact they are the carbon would described following the same the carboxylic acid carbon atom has oxidation state only gets one valence electron from the the oxygen atoms get all the other electrons because oxygen more electronegative than the oxygen atoms both have oxidation state they get electrons each from the lone pairs and from the while neutral oxygen atom would have the hydrogen atoms all have oxidation state because they surrender their electron the more electronegative atoms which they are structural diagrams for organic oxidation states are represented roman numerals distinguish them from formal charges calculated with all bonds inequivalent atoms element example molecule with inequivalent atoms the same element the thiosulfate ion for which the algebraic sum rule yields the average value for where the two ionizing electrons are assigned the terminal sulfur however the use lewis structure and electron counting shows that the two sulfur atoms are the central sulfur assigned only one valence electron from the bond and valence electrons from the compared six valence electrons for free sulfur the oxidation state the central sulfur the terminal sulfur atom assigned the other electron from the bond plus three lone pairs for total seven valence its oxidation state redox reactions oxidation states can useful for balancing chemical equations for reduction redox reactions because the changes the oxidized atoms have balanced the changes the reduced for the reaction acetaldehyde with the tollens reagent acetic acid shown the carbonyl carbon atom changes its oxidation state from this oxidation balanced reducing two equivalents silver from elements with multiple oxidation states list oxidation states the elements most elements have more than one possible oxidation for carbon has nine integer oxidation chcl chcl chcl ccl fractional oxidation states fractional oxidation states are often used represent the average oxidation states several atoms for the formula magnetite implying oxidation state for iron however this average value may not representative the atoms are not two thirds the iron ions are and third and the formula may better represented likewise propane has been described having carbon oxidation state again this average value since the structure the molecule and the central carbon not equivalent the other example with fractional oxidation states for equivalent atoms potassium superoxide the diatomic superoxide ion has overall charge each its two oxygen atoms assigned oxidation state this ion can described resonance hybrid two lewis where each oxygen has oxidation state one structure and the for the cyclopentadienyl ion the oxidation state the occurs because each bonded one hydrogen less electronegative and the because the total ionic charge divided among five equivalent oxidation state and formal charge formal charge formal charge compared oxidation state the oxidation state atom often different from the formal charge often included lewis structures when the oxidation state calculated assuming that each chemical bond except between identical ionic that both electrons are assigned the more electronegative bonded the formal charge calculated assuming that each bonds covalent that one electron assigned each bonded for ammonium ion the oxidation state nitrogen all eight valence electrons are assigned the nitrogen atom that more electronegative than however the formal charge calculated assigning only four valence electrons one per for the nitrogen ammonia has oxidation state also but formal charge protonation ammonia the formal charge nitrogen but its oxidation state does not for molecules that contain nonequivalent atoms the same oxidation number coordination compounds whist oxidation state and oxidation number are often used oxidation number used coordination chemistry with slightly different coordination the rules used for counting electrons are every electron ligand bond belongs the ligand regardless that the oxidation number the charge that would remain all ligands were removed together with the electron pairs shared with the central for most coordination the metal atom the less electronegative end each ligand that this rule gives the same result the based rule there are however such wilkinson catalyst rhcl pph phenyl which the rhodium atom more electronegative than nevertheless the oxidation number rhodium this molecule considered and the systematic name the electrons are assigned the atom the the electronegativity rule would assign them instead the with oxidation state spectroscopic oxidation states formal oxidation numbers although formal oxidation numbers can helpful for classifying they are unmeasurable and their physical meaning can formal oxidation numbers require particular caution for molecules where the bonding since the formal oxidation numbers require the heterolytic removal ligands which essence denies covalency spectroscopic oxidation states defined jorgenson and reiterated are measurables that are marked using spectroscopic and crystallographic data oxidation state can also have effect spectroscopic studies infrared spectroscopy metal carbonyls this effect illustrated using spectroscopic studies metals from oxidation states unusual formal oxidation states high valent iron unusual formal oxidation states metals are important biochemical the notable ones being and cytochrome containing history the oxidation number concept oxidation itself was first studied antoine lavoisier who believed that oxidation was always the result reactions with oxygen thus the although idea has been shown the name proposed still albeit more oxidation states were one the intellectual stepping that mendeleev used derive the periodic the stock nomenclature named for alfred stock who suggested was intended replace the naming that was prevalent the under the stock system fecl was called chloride rather than ferrous the current concept oxidation was introduced latimer iupac recommended that the term stock number should replaced the term oxidation pauling proposed that the oxidation number could determined using the electronegativity the atoms determine the ions the formal determination oxidation iupac defined oxidation number terms iupac changed course and adopted rule based determination for the central rather than using this the definition the current gold book for oxidation they also introduced the definition oxidation shown the current gold that appears make oxidation number specific coordination this may not have been their they issued new recommendations for inorganic nomenclature that define oxidation number the same terms the definition oxidation and that oxidation number the earlier used the naming inorganic oxidation number versus oxidation state the wider field chemistry the iupac definitions have not been adhered and both terms are used they were when latimer introduced the concept for two known textbooks use the term oxidation state and represent roman numerals chemical the point has been made there any semantic difference between the then oxidation number refers the specific numerical value assigned the entity known oxidation much iupac use the term charge number refer the numerical value assigned the entity know ionic the iupac gold book takes the definitions from iupac papers rather than the more recent current iupac recommendations iupac towards comprehensive definition oxidation project started the technical report has been published pure and applied the project was undertaken because the current definition the iupac gold book was seen narrow and and inapplicable zintl phases and some organometallic see also list oxidation states the elements electrochemistry
