water the increased solubility lower temperatures see physical properties has important implications for ocean polar oceans support much higher density life due their higher oxygen water polluted with plant nutrients such nitrates phosphates may stimulate growth algae process called eutrophication and the decay these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts eutrophic water scientists assess this aspect water quality measuring the biochemical oxygen demand the amount needed restore normal analysis climate change paleoclimatologists measure the ratio and the shells and skeletons marine organisms determine what the climate was like millions years ago see oxygen isotope ratio cycle seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope oxygen evaporate slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the heavier this disparity increases lower during periods lower global snow and rain from that evaporated water tends higher and the seawater left behind tends higher marine organisms then incorporate more into their skeletons and shells than they would warmer paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio the water molecules ice core samples that are several hundreds thousands years planetary geologists have measured different abundances oxygen isotopes samples from the earth the moon mars and meteorites but were long unable obtain reference values for the isotope ratios the sun believed the same those the primordial solar nebula however analysis silicon wafer exposed the solar wind space and returned the crashed genesis spacecraft has shown that the sun has higher proportion than does the the measurement implies that unknown process depleted from the disk protoplanetary material prior the coalescence dust grains that formed the oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking the wavelengths and some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement the radiance coming from vegetation canopies those bands characterize plant health status from satellite platform this approach exploits the fact that those bands possible discriminate the reflectance from its fluorescence which much the measurement technically difficult owing the low signal noise ratio and the physical structure but has been proposed possible method monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites global biological role dioxygen

atmosphere geological history oxygen free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent earth atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved probably about billion years free oxygen first appeared significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon between and billion years for the first billion any free oxygen produced these organisms combined with dissolved iron the oceans form banded iron formations when such oxygen sinks became free oxygen began outgas from the oceans billion years reaching its present level around billion years the presence large amounts dissolved and free oxygen the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most the anaerobic organisms then living extinction during the great oxygenation event oxygen catastrophe about billion years however cellular respiration using enables aerobic organisms produce much more atp than anaerobic helping the former dominate biosphere cellular respiration occurs all eukaryotes including all complex multicellular organisms such plants and since the beginning the cambrian period million years levels have fluctuated between and towards the end the carboniferous period about million years atmospheric levels reached maximum which may have contributed the large size insects and amphibians this human including the burning billion tonnes fossil fuels each year have had very little effect the amount free oxygen the the current rate photosynthesis would take about years regenerate the entire the present history early experiments investigators one the first known experiments the relationship between combustion and air was conducted the bce greek writer philo byzantium his work pneumatica philo observed that inverting vessel over burning candle and surrounding the neck with water resulted some water rising into the philo incorrectly surmised that parts the air the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able escape through pores the many centuries later leonardo vinci built work observing that portion air consumed during combustion and respiration the late robert boyle proved that air necessary for english chemist john mayow refined this work showing that fire requires only part air that called spiritus nitroaereus just nitroaereus one experiment found that placing either mouse lit candle closed container over water caused the water rise and replace fourteenth the volume before extinguishing the from this surmised that nitroaereus consumed both respiration and mayow observed that antimony increased weight when and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction nitroaereus with certain substances the accounts these and other experiments and ideas were published his work tractatus duo the tract phlogiston theory phlogiston theory stahl robert hooke ole borch mikhail lomonosov and pierre bayen all produced oxygen experiments the and the century but none them recognized chemical element this may have been part due the prevalence the philosophy combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston which was then the favored explanation those established the german alchemist becher and modified the chemist georg ernst stahl phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made two one called was given off when the substance containing was while the dephlogisticated part was thought its true calx highly combustible materials that leave little residue such wood were thought made mostly whereas combustible substances that such contained very air did not play role phlogiston nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted test the instead was based observations what happens when something that most common objects appear become lighter and seem lose something the the fact that substance like wood actually gains overall weight burning was hidden the buoyancy the gaseous combustion indeed one the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that too gain weight rusting when they were supposedly losing discovery carl wilhelm scheele oxygen was first discovered swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele had produced oxygen gas heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates about scheele called the gas fire because was the only known supporter and wrote account this discovery manuscript titled treatise air and fire which sent his publisher however that document was not published until joseph priestley the august experiment conducted the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight mercuric oxide inside glass which liberated gas named dephlogisticated noted that candles burned brighter the gas and that mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing after breathing the gas the feeling lungs was not sensibly different from that common but fancied that breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time priestley published his findings paper titled account further discoveries which was included the second volume his book titled experiments and observations different kinds air because published his findings priestley usually given priority the the noted french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed have discovered the new substance however priestley visited lavoisier october and told him about his experiment and how liberated the new scheele also posted letter lavoisier september that described his own discovery the previously unknown but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving copy the letter was found belongings after his lavoisier contribution what lavoisier did indisputably although this was disputed the was conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments oxidation and give the first correct explanation how combustion used these and similar all started discredit the phlogiston theory and prove that the substance discovered priestley and scheele was chemical element antoine lavoisier one lavoisier observed that there was overall increase weight when tin and air were heated closed noted that air rushed when opened the which indicated that part the trapped air had been also noted that the tin had increased weight and that increase was the same the weight the air that rushed back this and other experiments combustion were documented his book sur combustion ral which was published that proved that air mixture two vital which essential combustion and and azote lifeless which did not support azote later became nitrogen although has kept the name french and several other european lavoisier renamed vital oxyg from the greek roots acid literally sharp from the taste and literally because mistakenly believed that oxygen was constituent all chemists notably sir humphry davy eventually determined that lavoisier was wrong this regard fact hydrogen that forms the basis for acid but that time was too the name had oxygen entered the english language despite opposition english scientists and the fact that the englishman priestley had first isolated the gas and written about this partly due poem praising the gas titled oxygen the popular book the botanic garden erasmus darwin grandfather charles darwin later history robert goddard rocket john dalton original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect one for dalton assumed that formula was giving the atomic mass oxygen times that instead the modern value about joseph louis lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water formed two volumes hydrogen and one volume and amedeo avogadro had arrived the correct interpretation based what now called avogadro law and the assumption diatomic elemental the late century scientists realized that air could and its components compressing and cooling using cascade method swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide order liquefy carbon which turn was evaporated cool oxygen gas enough liquefy sent telegram december the french academy sciences paris announcing his discovery liquid oxygen just two days french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method liquefying molecular only few drops the liquid were produced either case meaningful analysis could oxygen was liquified stable state for the first time march polish scientists from jagiellonian university zygmunt blewski and karol olszewski scottish chemist james dewar was able produce enough liquid oxygen the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william both men lowered the temperature air until liquefied and then distilled the component gases boiling them off one time and capturing later oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time burning mixture acetylene and compressed this method welding and cutting metal later became the american scientist robert goddard became the first person develop rocket engine that burned liquid the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen the oxidizer goddard successfully flew small fueled rocket march auburn massachusetts industrial production air separation oxygen evolution fractional distillation two major methods are employed produce tonnes extracted from air for industrial uses the most common method fractionally distill liquefied air into its various with distilling vapor while left hofmann electrolysis apparatus the other major method producing gas involves passing stream dry air through one bed pair identical zeolite molecular which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers gas stream that simultaneously nitrogen gas released from the other saturated zeolite reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part the oxygen gas from the producer bed through the reverse direction after set cycle time the operation the two beds thereby allowing for continuous supply gaseous oxygen pumped through this known pressure swing adsorption oxygen gas increasingly obtained these cryogenic technologies see also the related vacuum swing
