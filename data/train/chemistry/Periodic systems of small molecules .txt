periodic systems molecules are charts molecules similar the periodic table the construction such charts was initiated the early century and still commonly believed that the periodic law represented the periodic echoed the behavior molecules least small molecules for one replaces any one the atoms triatomic molecule with rare gas atom there will drastic change the several goals could accomplished constructing explicit representation this periodic law manifested classification scheme for the vast number molecules that starting with small ones having just few for use teaching aid and tool for archiving forecasting data for molecular properties based the classification and sort unity with the periodic chart and the periodic system fundamental particles contents physical periodic systems molecules chemical periodic systems molecules hyperperiodicity bases the element chart and periodic systems molecules coordinate system for triatomic molecules references physical periodic systems molecules periodic systems charts molecules are the subjects two the systems diatomic molecules include those clark and kong which somewhat resemble the atomic the system hefferlin was developed from dimensional dimensional system kronecker product the element chart with totally different kind periodic system that zhuvikin which based group dynamics all but the first these other researchers provided invaluable contributions and some them are the architectures these systems have been adjusted kong and hefferlin include ionized and expanded hefferlin and zhuvikin and hefferlin the space triatomic these architectures are mathematically related the chart the they were first called periodic chemical periodic systems molecules other investigators have focused building structures that address specific kinds molecules such alkanes benzenoids functional groups containing fluorine oxygen nitrogen and sulfur combination core charge number redox potentials and base tendencies these structures are not restricted molecules with given number atoms and they bear little resemblance the element they are called systems chemical systems not start with the element but instead start for formula enumerations the hydrogen displacement principle reduced potential curves set molecular descriptors and similar hyperperiodicity babaev has erected hyperperiodic system which principle includes all the systems described above except those gorski and bases the element chart and periodic systems molecules the periodic chart the like small supported three the bohr sommerfeld solar system atomic model with electron spin and the madelung principle which provides the number elements that end each row the table and gives the number elements each solutions the schr dinger equation which provide the same and data provided the solar system and solutions the schroedinger the bohr sommerfeld model should not gave explanations for the wealth spectroscopic data that were already existence before the advent wave mechanics each the molecular systems listed and those not also supported three physical and chemical data arranged graphical tabular patterns for physical periodic systems echo the appearance the element group valence molecular and other fundamental and summing atomic period and group numbers the kronecker product and exploitation higher dimensions formula enumerations the displacement principle reduced potential curves and similar chronological list the contributions this field contains almost thirty entries dated and then after higher level activity beginning with the anniversary publication his element many publications periodic systems molecules include some predictions molecular but starting the turn the century there have been serious attempts use periodic systems for the prediction progressively more precise data for various numbers among these attempts are those and hefferlin coordinate system for triatomic molecules the collapsed coordinate system has three independent variables instead the six demanded the product the reduction independent variables makes use three properties ground triatomic whatever the total number constituent atomic valence data for isoelectronic molecules tend more similar than for adjacent molecules that have more fewer valence for triatomic the electron count the sum the atomic group numbers the sum the column numbers the block the periodic chart the linear bent triatomic molecules appear slightly more other parameters being carbon the central most physical properties diatomic molecules especially spectroscopic are closely monotonic with respect the product the two atomic period numbers and for triatomic the monotonicity close with respect which reduces for diatomic therefore the coordinates and the coordinate system are and multiple regression predictions four property values for molecules with tabulated data agree very well with the tabulated data the error measures the predictions include the tabulated data all but few
