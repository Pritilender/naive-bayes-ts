periodic table navigation search periodic table layout the periodic table tabular arrangement the chemical elements organized the basis their atomic numbers electron configurations electron shell and recurring chemical properties elements are presented order increasing atomic number the number protons the the standard form the table consists grid elements laid out columns and rows with double row elements below the table can also deconstructed into four rectangular blocks the block the the block the the block the and the block below the rows the table are called periods the columns are called groups with some these having names such halogens noble gases since periodic table incorporates recurring trends any such table can used derive relationships between the properties the elements and predict the properties yet discovered elements periodic whether the standard form some other provides useful framework for analyzing chemical and such tables are widely used chemistry and other although precursors dmitri mendeleev generally credited with the the first widely recognized periodic developed his table illustrate periodic trends the properties the known mendeleev also predicted some properties then unknown elements that would expected fill gaps this most his predictions were proved correct when the elements question were subsequently mendeleev periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery synthesis further new elements and the development new theoretical models explain chemical all elements from atomic numbers hydrogen ununoctium have been

elements with stable isotopes have the atomic masses their most stable where such masses are listed the standard periodic the elements are listed order increasing atomic number the number protons the nucleus new row period started when new electron shell has its first columns groups are determined the electron configuration the elements with the same number electrons particular subshell fall into the same columns oxygen and selenium are the same column because they both have four electrons the outermost elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group the periodic although the and some respect the the elements the same period tend have similar thus relatively easy predict the chemical properties element one knows the properties the elements around the periodic table has confirmed comprising elements and elements and have reportedly been synthesised laboratories however none these claims have been officially confirmed the international union pure and applied chemistry such these elements are currently known only their systematic element based their atomic total elements occur the remaining elements from einsteinium and flerovium and occur only when

grouping methods groups group periodic group family vertical column the periodic groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and explained modern quantum mechanical theories atomic structure explain group trends proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations their valence shell consequently elements the same group tend have shared chemistry and exhibit clear trend properties with increasing atomic however some parts the periodic such the block and the horizontal similarities can important more pronounced vertical under international naming the groups are numbered numerically from from the leftmost column the alkali the rightmost column the noble previously they were known roman numerals the roman numerals were followed either the group was the block the group was the block the roman numerals used correspond the last digit naming convention the group elements were group and the group elements was group the lettering was except that was used the group was before group and was used for groups including and after group groups and used treated one sized known collectively both notations group the new iupac naming system was put into and the old group names were some these groups have been given trivial names seen the table although some are rarely groups have trivial names and are referred simply their group numbers the name the first member their group such the scandium for group since they display fewer similarities vertical elements the same group tend show patterns atomic radius ionization energy and electronegativity from top bottom the atomic radii the elements since there are more filled energy valence electrons are found farther from the from the each successive element has lower ionization energy because easier remove electron since the atoms are less tightly similarly group has top bottom decrease electronegativity due increasing distance between valence electrons and the there are exceptions these however example which occurs group where electronegativity increases farther down the groups the group number cas old iupac trivial name period period period period period block period period uut uup uus uuo alkali metals periods period periodic period horizontal row the periodic although groups generally have more significant periodic there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group such the where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series elements the same period show trends atomic ionization electron affinity and moving left right across atomic radius usually this occurs because each successive element has added proton and electron which causes the electron drawn closer the this decrease atomic radius also causes the ionization energy increase when moving from left right across the more tightly bound element the more energy required remove electronegativity increases the same manner ionization energy because the pull exerted the electrons the electron affinity also shows slight trend across metals left side generally have lower electron affinity than nonmetals right side with the exception the noble blocks block periodic the different regions the periodic table are sometimes referred blocks recognition the sequence which the electron shells the elements are each block named according the subshell which the last electron notionally the block comprises the first two groups alkali metals and alkaline earth well hydrogen and the block comprises the last six groups which are groups iupac and among other all the metalloids the block comprises groups iupac american group and contains all the transition metals the block usually offset below the rest the periodic comprises the lanthanides and categories the elements can conveniently classified according their shared physical and chemical properties into the major categories metalloids and metals are generally located the left and bottom the periodic they are ordinarily highly conducting solids which form alloys with one another and like ionic compounds with nonmetals are located the right and they are mostly coloured colourless insulating gases that form covalent compounds with one between metals and nonmetals are which have intermediate mixed metal and nonmetals can further classified into similar subcategories that show left right gradation metallic metallic the metals are divided into the highly reactive alkali through the less reactive alkaline earth lanthanides and via the archetypal transition and ending the physically and chemically weak other the nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which being nearest the show some incipient metallic the diatomic nonmetals which are essentially and the monatomic noble which are almost completely inert and specialized groupings such the refractory metals and the noble metals which are subsets this the transition are also known and occasionally placing the elements into categories and subcategories based shared properties there spectrum properties within each category and not hard find overlaps the the case with most classification beryllium for classified alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes chemically weak other radon classified nonmetal and noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that more characteristic other classification schemes are possible such the division the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories crystalline structures categorising the elements this fashion dates back least when hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could drawn the periodic table show elements having like such the metals and the the gaseous other conventions and variations presentations the periodic the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown two additional rows below the main body the with placeholders else selected single element each series either lanthanum and either actinium lawrencium respectively shown single cell the main between barium and hafnium and radium and rutherfordium respectively this convention entirely matter aesthetics and formatting rarely used formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series their proper parts the sixth and seventh rows some periodic tables include dividing line between metals and periodic trends periodic trends electron configuration electronic configuration madelung rule the electron configuration organisation electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows recurring pattern the electrons occupy series electron shells numbered shell shell and each shell consists one more subshells named and atomic number increases electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more less according the madelung rule energy ordering shown the the electron configuration for neon for with atomic number neon has two electrons the first and eight electrons the second two the subshell and six the periodic table the first time electron occupies new shell corresponds the start each new these positions being occupied hydrogen and the alkali metals since the properties element are mostly determined its electron the properties the elements likewise show recurring patterns periodic some examples which are shown the diagrams below for atomic ionization energy and electron this periodicity manifestations which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed that led the establishment the periodic law the properties the elements recur varying and the formulation the first periodic atomic radii atomic radius atomic radii vary predictable and explainable manner across the periodic for the radii generally decrease along each period the from the alkali metals the noble and increase down each the radius increases sharply between the noble gas the end each period and the alkali metal the beginning the next these trends the atomic radii and various other chemical and physical properties the can explained the electron shell theory the they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation quantum theory the electrons the which progressively filled from cerium lutetium are not particularly effective shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the shells further the elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii which are smaller than would expected and which are almost identical the atomic radii the elements immediately above hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius and zirconium and tantalum has atomic radius similar niobium and this known the lanthanide contraction the effect the lanthanide contraction noticeable platinum after which masked relativistic effect known the inert pair effect the block contraction which similar effect between the block and block less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from similar ionization energy ionization energy the first ionization energy the energy takes remove one electron from the second ionization energy the energy takes remove second electron from the and for given successive ionization energies increase with the degree for magnesium the first ionization energy mol and the second electrons the closer orbitals experience greater forces electrostatic thus their removal requires increasingly more ionization energy becomes greater and the right the periodic large jumps the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing electron from noble gas complete electron configuration for magnesium the first two molar ionization energies magnesium given above correspond removing the two and the third ionization energy much larger for the removal electron from the very stable neon like configuration similar jumps occur the ionization energies other row electronegativity electronegativity electronegativity the tendency atom attract electrons electronegativity affected both its atomic number and the distance between the valence electrons and the the higher its the more element attracts was first proposed linus pauling electronegativity increases passing from left right along and decreases descending hence fluorine the most electronegative the while caesium the least those elements for which substantial data there are some exceptions this general gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because the block elements the fourth period immediately after the first row the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the electrons are not effective shielding the increased nuclear and smaller atomic size correlates with higher the anomalously high electronegativity particularly when compared thallium and bismuth appears artifact data selection and data methods calculation other than the pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these electron affinity electron affinity group elements the electron affinity atom the amount energy released when electron added neutral atom form negative although electron affinity varies some patterns generally nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals chlorine most strongly attracts extra the electron affinities the noble gases have not been measured they may may not have slightly negative electron affinity generally increases across this caused the filling the valence shell the group atom releases more energy than group atom gaining electron because obtains filled valence shell and therefore more trend decreasing electron affinity going down groups would the additional electron will entering orbital farther away from the such this electron would less attracted the nucleus and would release less energy when however going down around third elements are with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter largely this due the poor shielding and uniform decrease electron affinity only applies group atoms metallic character the lower the values ionization electronegativity and electron the more metallic character the element conversely nonmetallic character increases with higher values these given the periodic trends these three metallic character tends decrease going across period and with some irregularities due poor screening the nucleus and and relativistic effects tends increase going down group column thus the most metallic elements such caesium and francium are found the bottom left traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements oxygen fluorine chlorine the top the combination horizontal and vertical trends metallic character explains the shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found some periodic and the practice sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent that elements adjacent those metalloids history history the periodic table first systemization attempts discovery the elements antoine lavoisier published list chemical elements grouping them into gases metals nonmetals and earths chemists spent the following century searching for more precise classification johann wolfgang bereiner observed that many the elements could grouped into triads based their chemical lithium sodium and potassium for were grouped together triad reactive metals bereiner also observed when arranged atomic the second member each triad was roughly the average the first and the this became known the law triads german chemist leopold gmelin worked with this and had identified ten three groups and one group jean baptiste dumas published work describing relationships between various groups although various chemists were able identify relationships between small groups they had yet build one scheme that encompassed them german chemist august observed that carbon often has four other atoms bonded methane for has one carbon atom and four hydrogen this concept eventually became known valency different elements bond with different numbers alexandre emile guyer chancourtois french published early form periodic which called the telluric helix was the first person notice the periodicity the with the elements arranged spiral cylinder order increasing atomic chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed occur regular his chart included some ions and compounds addition his paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include received little attention until the work dmitri mendeleev julius lothar meyer german published table with elements arranged the table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same concurrently william odling english published arrangement elements ordered the basis their atomic with some irregularities and noticed what appeared periodicity atomic weights amongst the elements and that this accorded with their usually received odling alluded the idea periodic law but did not pursue subsequently proposed based classification the newlands english chemist john newlands produced series papers from noting that when the elements were listed order increasing atomic similar physical and chemical properties recurred intervals likened such periodicity the octaves this termed law octaves however was ridiculed contemporaries and the chemical society refused publish his newlands was nonetheless able draft table the elements and used predict the existence missing such germanium the chemical society only acknowledged the significance his discoveries five years after they credited gustavus hinrichs danish born academic chemist based published spiral periodic system based atomic spectra and and chemical his work was regarded ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and mendeleev table russian chemistry professor dmitri mendeleev and german chemist julius lothar meyer independently published their periodic tables and respectively mendeleev table was his first published that meyer was expanded version his table they both constructed their tables listing the elements rows columns order atomic weight and starting new row column when the characteristics the elements began the recognition and acceptance afforded table came from two decisions the first was leave gaps the table when seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been mendeleev was not the first chemist but was the first recognized using the trends his periodic table predict the properties those missing elements such gallium and germanium the second decision was occasionally ignore the order suggested the atomic weights and switch adjacent such tellurium and iodine better classify them into chemical families with the development theories atomic became apparent that mendeleev had unintentionally listed the elements order increasing atomic number nuclear the significance atomic numbers the organization the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties protons and neutrons became mendeleev periodic tables used atomic weight instead atomic number organize the information determinable fair precision his atomic weight worked well enough most cases give presentation that was able predict the properties missing elements more accurately than any other method then substitution atomic once gave integer based sequence for the still used today even new synthetic elements are being produced and further development mendeleev published form periodic with groups similar elements arranged columns from viii also gave detailed predictions for the properties elements had earlier noted were but should these gaps were subsequently filled chemists discovered additional naturally occurring often stated that the last naturally occurring element discovered was francium referred mendeleev eka caesium however plutonium produced synthetically was identified

prepared handout form column medium which was widely circulated american the table was appearing handbooks and encyclopaedias was also distributed for many years the welch scientific with the development modern quantum mechanical theories electron configurations within became apparent that each period the table corresponded the filling quantum shell larger atoms have more electron later tables have required progressively longer glenn seaborg glenn seaborg american made the suggestion that the actinide elements like the lanthanides were filling before this time the actinides were thought forming fourth block seaborg colleagues advised him not publish such radical suggestion would most likely ruin his seaborg considered did not then have career bring into published seaborg suggestion was found correct and subsequently went win the nobel prize chemistry for his work synthesizing actinide although minute quantities some transuranic elements occur they were all first discovered their production has expanded the periodic table the first these being neptunium synthesized because many the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly they are challenging detect and characterize when there have been controversies concerning the acceptance competing discovery claims for some requiring independent review determine which party has and hence naming the

currently placed the carbon group more recent experiments have however that flerovium behaves chemically like expected from its periodic table further periodic table extensions extended periodic table unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern the current periodic table period require further adaptations seaborg expected the eighth period follow the previously established pattern that would include element block for elements and new block for the next elements and additional elements continuing the current and more physicists such pekka have theorized that these additional elements not follow the madelung rule which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance the present periodic element with the highest possible atomic number the number possible

not necessarily the end the periodic placement hydrogen and helium hydrogen and helium are often placed different places than their electron configurations would hydrogen usually placed above accordance with its electron but sometimes placed above fluorine even also behaves somewhat similarly hydrogen also sometimes placed its own does not behave similarly enough any element placed group with helium almost always placed above neon they are very similar although occasionally placed above beryllium account having comparable electron shell configuration beryllium groups included the transition metals the definition transition metal given element whose atom has incomplete which can give rise cations with incomplete this definition all the elements groups are transition the iupac definition therefore excludes group comprising cadmium and from the transition metals some chemists treat the categories block elements and transition interchangeably thereby including groups among the transition this instance the group elements are treated special case transition metal which the electrons are not ordinarily involved chemical the recent discovery that mercury can use its electrons the formation mercury fluoride hgf has prompted some commentators suggest that mercury can regarded transition other such have argued that the formation compound like hgf can occur only under highly abnormal mercury could not regarded transition metal any reasonable interpretation the ordinary meaning the still other chemists further exclude the group elements from the definition transition they the basis that the group elements not form any ions having partially occupied shell and not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic transition metal this only groups are regarded transition period and elements group although scandium and yttrium are always the first two group elements the identity the next two elements not agreed they are either lanthanum and lutetium and although there are some strong physical and chemical arguments supporting the latter arrangement not all authors are the current iupac definition the term lanthanoid includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and and that transition applies lanthanum and well lutetium but not lawrencium since does not correctly follow the aufbau principle normally the electron would enter the but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration actually due relativistic effects iupac thus has not recommended specific format for the block periodic leaving the dispute lanthanum and actinium are sometimes considered the remaining members group their most commonly encountered tripositive ion these elements not possess any partially filled orbitals thus continuing the actinium which all the elements have relationship similar that elements the radium the left neighbors block however different behavior observed other block groups especially group which hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking clear other lutetium and lawrencium are classified the remaining members group these lutetium and lawrencium end sometimes the lanthanide and actinide series respectively since the shell nominally full the ground state electron configuration for both these they behave most similarly other period and period transition metals compared the other lanthanides and and thus logically exhibit properties similar those scandium and this behavior expected for but has not been observed because sufficient quantities lawrencium have not yet been synthesized some including the official iupac table refer all lanthanides and actinides marker group this sometimes believed the inclusion all lanthanide and actinide elements included group lanthanides electropositive trivalent metals all have closely related and all show many similarities scandium and but they also show additional properties characteristic their partially filled orbitals which are not common scandium and exclusion all elements based properties earlier which show much wider variety chemistry for range oxidation states within their series than the and comparisons scandium and yttrium are even less however these elements are and they were stabilized more closely match chemistry they would similar lanthanides also the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding with only the valence and sometimes shown optimal form the many different forms periodic table have prompted the question whether there optimal definitive
