poly many mer parts large molecule macromolecule composed many repeated because their broad range both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous role everyday polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such polystyrene natural biopolymers such dna and proteins that are fundamental biological structure and polymers both natural and are created via polymerization many small known monomers their consequently large molecular mass relative small molecule compounds produces unique physical including toughness viscoelasticity and tendency form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals the term polymer derives from the ancient greek word polus meaning much and meros meaning parts and refers molecule whose structure composed multiple repeating from which originates characteristic high relative molecular mass and attendant the units composing polymers actually from molecules low relative molecular the term was coined jacob berzelius though with definition distinct from the modern iupac definition the modern concept polymers covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed hermann staudinger who spent the next decade finding experimental evidence for this polymers are studied the fields biophysics and macromolecular science and polymer science which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics historically products

however other structures for elements such silicon form familiar materials such examples being silly putty and waterproof plumbing oxygen also commonly present polymer such those polyethylene glycol polysaccharides glycosidic bonds and dna phosphodiester bonds polymer synthesis polymerization polymerization the process combining many small molecules known monomers into covalently bonded chain during the polymerization some chemical groups may lost from each this the for the polymerization pet polyester the monomers are terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol but the repeating unit which corresponds the combination the two monomers with the loss two water the distinct piece each monomer that incorporated into the polymer known repeat unit monomer laboratory synthetic methods are generally divided into two step growth polymerization and chain growth polymerization the essential difference between the two that chain growth monomers are added the chain one time such polyethylene whereas growth polymerization chains monomers may combine with one another such polyester however some newer methods such plasma polymerization not fit neatly into either synthetic polymerization

nitrocellulose and the formation vulcanized rubber heating natural rubber the presence sulfur ways which polymers can modified include oxidation cross linking and especially the production the gas separation membranes has acquired increasing importance the petrochemical industry and now relatively established unit the process polymer degassing necessary suit polymer for extrusion and increasing environmental and product quality nitrogen generally used for this resulting vent gas primarily composed monomers and polymer properties polymer properties are broadly divided into several classes based the scale which the property defined well upon its physical the most basic property polymer the identity its constituent second set known microstructure essentially describe the arrangement these monomers within the polymer the scale single these basic structural properties play major role determining bulk physical properties the which describe how the polymer behaves continuous macroscopic chemical the describe how the chains interact through various physical the they describe how the bulk polymer interacts with other chemicals and monomers and repeat units the identity the repeat units monomer also known mers comprising polymer its first and most important polymer nomenclature generally based upon the type monomer residues comprising the polymers that contain only single type repeat unit are known homopolymers while polymers containing mixture repeat units are known copolymers poly for composed only styrene monomer and therefore classified ethylene vinyl acetate the other contains more than one variety repeat unit and thus some biological polymers are composed variety different but structurally related monomer for polynucleotides such dna are composed variety nucleotide subunits polymer molecule containing ionizable subunits known polyelectrolyte ionomer microstructure microstructure the microstructure polymer sometimes called relates the physical arrangement monomer residues along the backbone the these are the elements polymer structure that require the breaking covalent bond order structure has strong influence the other properties for two samples natural rubber may exhibit different even though their molecules comprise the same polymer architecture polymer architecture important microstructural feature polymer its architecture and which relates the way branch points lead deviation from simple linear branched polymer molecule composed main chain with one more substituent side chains types branched polymers include star polymers comb polymers brush polymers dendronized polymers ladders and dendrimers there exist also two dimensional polymers which are composed topologically planar repeat architecture affects many its physical properties but not limited solution melt solubility various glass transition temperature and the size individual polymer coils variety techniques may employed for the synthesis polymeric material with range for example living polymerization chain length the physical properties polymer are strongly dependent the size length the polymer for chain length melting and boiling temperatures increase impact resistance also tends increase with chain does the viscosity resistance the polymer its melt melt viscosity related polymer chain length roughly that tenfold increase polymer chain length results viscosity increase over times increasing chain length furthermore tends decrease chain increase strength and and increase the glass transition temperature citation needed this result the increase chain interactions such van der waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length citation needed these interactions tend fix the individual chains more strongly position and resist deformations and matrix both higher stresses and higher temperatures citation needed common means expressing the length chain the degree polymerization which quantifies the number monomers incorporated into the with other size may also expressed terms molecular weight since synthetic polymerization techniques typically yield polymer product including range molecular the weight often expressed statistically describe the distribution chain lengths present the common examples are the number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight the ratio these two values the polydispersity index commonly used express the width the molecular weight final measurement contour which can understood the length the chain backbone its fully extended the flexibility unbranched chain polymer characterized its persistence length monomer arrangement copolymers copolymer monomers within copolymer may organized along the backbone variety alternating copolymers possess regularly alternating monomer periodic copolymers have monomer residue types arranged repeating being different from statistical copolymers have monomer residues arranged according known statistical statistical copolymer which the probability finding particular type monomer residue particular point the chain independent the types surrounding monomer residue may referred truly random copolymer block copolymers have two more homopolymer subunits linked covalent bonds polymers with two three blocks two distinct chemical species and are called diblock copolymers and triblock respectively polymers with three each different chemical species and are termed triblock graft grafted copolymers contain side chains that have different composition configuration than the main tacticity tacticity tacticity describes the relative stereochemistry chiral centers neighboring structural units within there are three isotactic all substituents the same atactic random placement and syndiotactic alternating placement polymer morphology polymer morphology generally describes the arrangement and microscale ordering polymer chains crystallinity when applied the term crystalline has somewhat ambiguous some the term crystalline finds identical usage that used conventional crystallography for the structure crystalline protein such sample prepared for ray crystallography may defined terms conventional unit cell composed one more polymer molecules with cell dimensions hundreds angstroms synthetic polymer may loosely described crystalline contains regions dimensional ordering atomic rather than length usually arising from intramolecular folding stacking adjacent synthetic polymers may consist both crystalline and amorphous the degree crystallinity may expressed terms weight fraction volume fraction crystalline few synthetic polymers are entirely the crystallinity polymers characterized their degree ranging from zero for completely crystalline polymer one for theoretical completely crystalline polymers with microcrystalline regions are generally tougher can bent more without and more resistant than totally amorphous polymers with degree crystallinity approaching zero one will tend while polymers with intermediate degrees crystallinity will tend opaque due light scattering crystalline glassy thus for many reduced crystallinity may also associated with increased chain conformation the space occupied polymer molecule generally expressed terms radius gyration which average distance from the center mass the chain the chain alternatively may expressed terms pervaded volume which the volume solution spanned the polymer chain and scales with the cube the radius mechanical properties necking the bulk properties polymer are those most often use these are the properties that dictate how the polymer actually behaves macroscopic tensile strength the tensile strength material quantifies how much stress the material will endure before this very important applications that rely upon physical strength for rubber band with higher tensile strength will hold greater weight before tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking polymer young modulus elasticity young modulus quantifies the elasticity the for small strains the ratio rate change stress like tensile this highly relevant polymer applications involving the physical properties such rubber the modulus strongly dependent viscoelasticity describes complex dependent elastic which will exhibit hysteresis the strain curve when the load dynamic mechanical analysis dma measures this complex modulus oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain function transport properties transport properties such diffusivity relate how rapidly molecules move through the polymer these are very important many applications polymers for films and phase behavior melting point the term melting point when applied suggests not liquid phase transition but transition from crystalline crystalline phase solid amorphous though abbreviated simply the property question more properly called the crystalline melting among synthetic crystalline melting only discussed with regards thermoplastics thermosetting polymers will decompose high temperatures rather than glass transition temperature parameter particular interest synthetic polymer manufacturing the glass transition temperature which amorphous polymers undergo transition from viscous glassy amorphous solid the glass transition temperature may engineered altering the degree branching crosslinking the polymer the addition plasticizer mixing behavior polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures small molecule materials this effect results from the fact that the driving force for mixing usually entropy not interaction other miscible materials usually form solution not because their interaction with each other more favorable than their but because increase entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount volume available each this increase entropy scales with the number particles being since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small the number molecules involved polymeric mixture far smaller than the number small molecule mixture equal the energetics the other comparable per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule this tends increase the free energy mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less thus concentrated solutions polymers are far rarer than those small furthermore the phase behavior polymer solutions and mixtures more complex than that small molecule whereas most small molecule solutions exhibit only upper critical solution temperature phase which phase separation occurs with polymer mixtures commonly exhibit lower critical solution temperature phase which phase separation occurs with dilute the properties the polymer are characterized the interaction between the solvent and the good the polymer appears swollen and occupies large this intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular bad solvent poor intramolecular forces dominate and the chain the theta solvent the state the polymer solution where the value the second virial coefficient becomes the intermolecular solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer under the theta condition also called the flory condition the polymer behaves like ideal random coil the transition between the states known coil globule transition inclusion plasticizers inclusion plasticizers tends lower and increase polymer plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically similar the polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain good example the action plasticizers related polyvinylchlorides unplasticized used for things such pipe has plasticizers because needs remain strong and plasticized pvc used clothing for flexible plasticizers are also put some types cling film make the polymer more chemical properties the attractive forces between polymer chains play large part determining because polymer chains are these interchain forces are amplified far beyond the attractions between conventional different side groups the polymer can lend the polymer ionic bonding hydrogen bonding between its own these stronger forces typically result higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting the intermolecular forces polymers can affected dipoles the monomer polymers containing amide carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds between adjacent the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms groups one chain are strongly attracted the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms groups these strong hydrogen for result the high tensile strength and melting point polymers containing urethane urea linkages polyesters have dipole dipole bonding between the oxygen atoms groups and the hydrogen atoms dipole bonding not strong hydrogen melting point and strength are lower than kevlar twaron but polyesters have greater ethene however has permanent the attractive forces between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der waals forces molecules can thought being surrounded cloud negative two polymer chains their electron clouds repel one this has the effect lowering the electron density one side polymer creating slight positive dipole this this charge enough attract the second polymer van der waals forces are quite however polyethylene can have lower melting temperature compared other standardized polymer nomenclature there are multiple conventions for naming polymer many commonly used such those found consumer are referred common trivial the trivial name assigned based historical precedent popular usage rather than standardized naming both the american chemical society and iupac have proposed standardized naming the acs and iupac conventions are similar but not examples the differences between the various naming conventions are given the table poly ethylene poly ethylene nylon both standardized the names are intended reflect the from which they are synthesized rather than the precise nature the repeating for the polymer synthesized from the simple alkene ethene called retaining the ene suffix even though the double bond removed during the polymerization polymer characterization polymer characterization the characterization polymer requires several parameters which need this because polymer actually consists statistical distribution chains varying and each chain consists monomer residues which affect its variety lab techniques are used determine the properties techniques such wide angle ray scattering

polyelectrolyte heterogeneous phase including emulsion polymerization adaptation batch and continuous and modifications polymer degradation polymer degradation crazing polymer degradation change the tensile color shape molecular polymer based product under the influence one more environmental such heat light chemicals and some galvanic action often due the scission polymer chain bonds via hydrolysis leading decrease the molecular mass the although such changes are frequently some such biodegradation and recycling they may intended prevent environmental pollution degradation can also useful biomedical for copolymer polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid employed hydrolysable stitches that slowly degrade after they are applied the susceptibility polymer degradation depends its epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible degradation while polyesters are susceptible degradation hydrolysis while polymers containing unsaturated backbone are especially susceptible ozone cracking carbon based polymers are more susceptible thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most temperature
