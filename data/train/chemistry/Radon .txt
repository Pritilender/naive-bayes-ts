found epidemiological studies history and etymology radon was the fifth radioactive element friedrich ernst dorn after thorium radium and dorn reported some experiments which noticed that radium compounds emanate radioactive gas named radium emanation before pierre and marie curie observed that the gas emitted radium remained radioactive for later that robert owens and ernest rutherford mcgill university montreal noticed variations when trying measure radiation from thorium rutherford noticed that the compounds thorium continuously emit radioactive gas that retains the radioactive powers for several and called this gas emanation from latin emanare elapse and emanatio and later thorium emanation demonstrated that the emanations are but credited the curies for the discovery the similar emanations were observed from actinium andr louis debierne and were called actinium emanation several names were suggested for these three exradio exthorio and exactinio radon thoron and akton radeon thoreon and actineon and eventually radon thoron and actinon the likeness the spectra these three gases with those krypton and and their observed chemical inertia led sir william ramsay suggest that the emanations might contain new element the noble gas sir william ramsay and robert gray isolated determined its and determined that was the heaviest known they wrote that expression manation radium est fort the expression radium very and suggested the new name niton from the latin nitens meaning shining emphasize the radioluminescence and was accepted the international commission for atomic weights the international committee for chemical elements and international union pure and applied chemistry chose among the names radon thoron and actinon later when isotopes were numbered instead the element took the name the most stable radon while was renamed and was renamed late the the element was also referred simply emanation the first synthesized compound radon was obtained the

some petroleum because radon has similar pressure and temperature curve propane and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based their boiling the piping carrying freshly separated propane oil

groundwater radon concentrations for earthquake prediction radon has life approximately days which means that can found only shortly after has been produced the radioactive decay for this has been hypothesized that increases radon concentration due the generation new cracks which would allow increased ground water flushing out the generation new cracks might not unreasonably assumed precede major the and scientific measurements radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with radon and radon was often detected with earthquake was then dismissed many unreliable

became available after world war quickly replaced radon for this they were lower cost and had less hazard alpha radiation health risks health effects radon mines radon actually radon has been classified international agency for research cancer being carcinogenic and gas that can lung cancer particular concern for people exposed high levels radon for sustained periods during the and when safety standards requiring expensive ventilation mines were not widely radon exposure was linked lung cancer among smoking miners uranium and other hard rock materials what now the czech republic and later among miners from the southwestern united since that ventilation and other measures have been used reduce radon levels most affected mines that continue recent the average annual exposure uranium miners has fallen levels similar the concentrations inhaled some this has reduced the risk occupationally induced cancer from although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed affected mines and for those who have been employed them the the relative risk for miners has has the ability detect excess risks among that addition lung researchers have theorized possible increased risk leukemia due radon empirical support from studies the general population however study uranium miners found noticeable correlation between radon exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia domestic level exposure radon exposure actually radon has been linked lung cancer numerous control studies performed the united europe and there are approximately deaths per year the usa due induced lung one the most comprehensive radon studies performed the united states william field and colleagues found increased lung cancer risk even the protracted exposures the action level pci north american and european pooled analyses further support these who international agency for research cancer most models residential radon exposure are based studies and direct estimates the risks posed homeowners would more nonetheless because the difficulties measuring the risk radon relative other namely models their effect have often made use radon has been considered the second leading cause lung cancer and leading environmental cause cancer mortality the united states environmental protection agency others have reached similar conclusions for the united kingdom and radon exposure homes and offices may arise from certain subsurface rock and also from certain building materials some the greatest risk radon exposure arises buildings that are insufficiently and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling action and reference level who presented recommended reference level the national reference for radon the recommendation also says that where this not should selected the highest national reference level should not but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration the actionable concentration radon home varies depending the organization doing the for the united states environmental protection agency encourages that action taken concentrations low and the european union recommends action taken when concentrations reach for old houses and for new july the health protection agency issued new advice setting target whilst retaining action the same levels applies norway from all new housings should radon relationship smoking results from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk lung cancer increases with exposure residential however there are always major uncertainties these classical and known example source error smoking the most important risk factor for lung the tobacco smoke estimated cause about all lung there tendency for other hypothetical lung cancer risks drown the risk results from epidemiological studies must always interpreted with according the the risk lung cancer for smokers significant due synergistic effects radon and for this population about people total will die lung cancer compared people total for people who have never however not excluded that the risk smokers should primarily explained combination effect radon and passive smoking see radon like other known suspected external risk factors for lung threat for smokers and former this was clearly demonstrated the european pooling commentary the pooling study not appropriate talk simply risk from radon the risk from compounded synergistic effect radon for without the effect seems small study radiation from post mastectomy radiotherapy shows that the simple models previously used assess the combined and separate risks from radiation and smoking need this also supported new discussion about the calculation lnt which routinely has been relationship passive smoking important question also passive smoking can cause similar synergy effect with residential this has been insufficiently the basic data for the european pooling study makes impossible exclude that such synergy effect explanation for the very increase the risk from radon that was stated for study from which included cases never smokers who had lung and control group never showed that exposure radon increased the risk lung cancer never but the group that had been exposed passive smoking home appeared bear the entire risk while those who were not exposed passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon drinking water the effects radon ingested are similarly although studies have found that its biological life ranges from minutes with percent removal minutes national research council investigated the issue radon drinking the risks associated with ingestion was considered almost water from underground sources may contain significant amounts radon depending the surrounding rock and soil whereas surface sources generally well being ingested through drinking radon also released from water when temperature pressure decreased and when water optimum conditions for radon release and exposure occur during water with radon concentration can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration pci under normal conditions water testing and mitigation radon mitigation there are relatively simple tests for radon some countries these tests are methodically done areas known systematic radon detection devices are commercially the term radon test devices used for screening purposes are some cases there are very important protocols for taking term radon tests and imperative that they strictly the kit includes collector that the user hangs the lowest livable floor the house for days the user then sends the collector laboratory for long term taking collections for one are also land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction radon levels fluctuate due factors like transient weather initial test might not accurate assessment average radon radon levels are maximum during the coolest part the day when pressure differentials are therefore high result over justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement measurements between and warrant long term radon measurements over warrant only another short term test that abatement measures are not unduly purchasers real estate are advised delay decline purchase the seller has not successfully abated radon because the life radon only days removing isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within few another method reducing radon levels modify the generally the indoor radon concentrations increase ventilation rates well ventilated the radon concentration tends align with outdoor values typically ranging from radon levels indoor air can lowered number from slab depressurization increasing the ventilation rate the the four principal ways reducing the amount radon accumulating house are sub slab depressurization soil increasing floor improving the ventilation the house and avoiding the transport radon from the basement into living installing radon sump system the installing positive pressurization positive supply ventilation according the epa the method reduce radon primarily used vent pipe system and which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents the which also called slab active soil soil generally indoor radon can mitigated slab depressurization and exhausting such laden air the away from windows and other building epa generally recommends methods which prevent the entry soil for prevents radon from entering your home drawing the radon from below the home and venting through the air above the home where quickly and epa does not recommend the use sealing alone reduce radon sealing has not been shown lower radon levels significantly positive pressure ventilation systems can combined with heat exchanger recover energy the process exchanging air with the and simply exhausting basement air the outside not necessarily viable solution this can actually draw radon gas into homes built crawl space may benefit from radon collector installed under radon sheet plastic that covers the crawl for the epa states effective method reduce radon levels crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with density plastic vent pipe and fan are used draw the radon from under the sheet and vent the this form soil suction called submembrane and when properly applied the most effective way reduce radon levels crawlspace see
