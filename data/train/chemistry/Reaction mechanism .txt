reaction mechanism navigation search chemistry reaction mechanism the step step sequence elementary reactions which overall chemical change although only the net chemical change directly observable for most chemical reactions experiments that suggest the possible sequence steps reaction mechanism can often recently electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been used corroborate the mechanism several organic reaction contents description examples modeling molecularity see also references description chemical mechanism describes detail exactly what takes place each stage overall chemical reaction also describes each reactive intermediate activated complex and transition state and which bonds are broken and what and which bonds are formed and what complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used the function catalyst stereochemistry all products formed and the amount must also describe the relative rates the reaction steps and the rate equation for the overall reaction intermediates are chemical often unstable and which are not reactants products the overall chemical but are temporary products and reactants the reaction reaction intermediates are often free radicals ions transition states can unstable intermediate molecular states even the elementary transition states are commonly molecular entities involving unstable number bonds unstable they correspond maxima the reaction coordinate and saddle points the potential energy surface for the reaction transition state carbon atom the electron arrow pushing method often used illustrating reaction for see the illustration the mechanism for benzoin condensation the following examples reaction mechanism must also account for the order which molecules often what appears step conversion fact multistep examples consider the following this experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according the rate law this form suggests that the rate determining step reaction between two molecules possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law each step called elementary and each has its own rate law and molecularity the elementary steps should add the original when determining the overall rate law for the slowest step the step that determines the reaction because the first step the above the slowest the rate determining step because involves the collision two molecules bimolecular reaction with rate law were cancel out all the molecules that appear both sides the would left with the original other reactions may have mechanisms several consecutive organic chemistry one the first reaction mechanisms proposed was that for the benzoin condensation put forward lapworth benzoin condensation reaction mechanism cyanide catalyst arrow pushing there are also more complex mechanisms such chain reactions which the propagation steps the chain form closed modeling correct reaction mechanism important part accurate predictive modeling for many combustion and plasma detailed mechanisms are not available require even when information identifying and assembling the relevant data from variety reconciling discrepant values and extrapolating different conditions can difficult process without expert rate constants thermochemical data are often not available the computational chemistry techniques additivity methods must used obtain the required the different stages reaction appropriate methods must one approach can involve the use crossover experiments molecularity molecularity molecularity chemistry the number colliding molecular entities that are involved single reaction step reaction step involving one molecular entity called reaction step involving two molecular entities called reaction step involving three molecular entities called reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities not see also organic reactions mechanism under organic reaction nucleophilic acyl substitution neighbouring group participation finkelstein reaction lindemann mechanism electrochemical reaction mechanism nucleophilic abstraction
