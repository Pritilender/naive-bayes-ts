chemistry	rearrangement reaction navigation search rearrangement reaction broad class organic reactions where the carbon skeleton molecule rearranged give structural isomer the original often substituent moves from one atom another atom the same the example below the substituent moves from carbon atom carbon atom intermolecular rearrangements also take rearrangement not well represented simple and discrete electron transfers represented curly arrows organic chemistry the actual mechanism alkyl groups wagner meerwein rearrangement probably involves transfer the moving alkyl group fluidly along not ionic breaking and pericyclic explanation orbital interactions give better picture than simple discrete electron nevertheless possible draw the curved arrows for sequence discrete electron transfers that give the same result rearrangement although these are not necessarily allylic rearrangement the reaction indeed three key rearrangement reactions are rearrangements pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis contents rearrangements pericyclic reactions olefin metathesis see also references rearrangements rearrangement rearrangement organic reaction where substituent moves from one atom another atom chemical shift the movement involves two adjacent atoms but moves over larger distances are examples are the wagner meerwein rearrangement and the beckmann rearrangement pericyclic reactions pericyclic reactions pericyclic reaction type reaction with multiple carbon bond making and breaking wherein the transition state the molecule has cyclic and the reaction progresses concerted examples are hydride shifts and the claisen rearrangement olefin metathesis olefin metathesis olefin metathesis formal exchange the alkylidene fragments two catalytic reaction with carbene more transition metal carbene complex intermediates this vinyl compound dimerized with the expulsion ethene see also beckmann rearrangement curtius rearrangement hofmann rearrangement lossen rearrangement schmidt reaction tiemann rearrangement wolff rearrangement photochemical rearrangements
