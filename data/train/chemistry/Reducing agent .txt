reducing agent reducing agents navigation search reducing agent also called reductant reducer element compound that loses donates electron another chemical species redox chemical since the reducing agent losing said have been any chemical electron donor reducing another must electron recipient oxidizing agent reducing agent oxidized because loses electrons the redox thus reducers are oxidized oxidizers and oxidizers are reduced reducers are themselves reduced have more and oxidizers are themselves oxidized have fewer reducing agent typically one its lower possible oxidation states and known the electron examples reducing agents include the earth formic acid and sulfite compounds for consider the overall reaction for aerobic cellular respiration the oxygen being the oxidizing the glucose being the reducing organic chemistry reduction more specifically refers the addition hydrogen though the aforementioned definition still for benzene reduced cyclohexane the presence platinum catalyst organic good reducing agents are reagents that deliver historically reduction referred the removal oxygen from hence the name the modern sense donating electrons generalisation this acknowledging that other components can play similar chemical role contents characteristics reducing agents importance reducing and oxidizing agents example redox reaction common reducing agents several common reducing agents and their products see also references further reading external links characteristics reducing agents consider the following the reducing agent this reaction ferrocyanide donates becoming oxidized ferricyanide simultaneously the oxidizer chlorine reduced chloride strong reducing agents easily lose electrons atom with relatively large atomic radius tends better such the distance from the nucleus the valence electrons long that these electrons are not strongly these elements tend strong reducing good reducing agents tend consist atoms with low electronegativity the ability atom molecule attract bonding and species with relatively small ionization energies serve good reducing agents the measure material oxidize lose electrons known its oxidation the table below shows few reduction potentials that could easily changed oxidation potential simply reversing the reducing agents can ranked increasing strength ranking their oxidation the reducing agent stronger when has more positive oxidation potential and weaker when has negative oxidation the following table provides the reduction potentials the indicated reducing agent tell which the strongest reducing one can change the sign its respective reduction potential make oxidation the bigger the the stronger the reducing for among and the strongest reducing agent and the weakest common reducing agents include metals calcium barium sodium and and also compounds that contain the ion those being nah lih lialh and cah some elements and compounds can both reducing oxidizing agents hydrogen gas reducing agent when reacts with metals and oxidizing agent when reacts with hydrogen acts oxidizing agent because accepts electron donation from which causes half hydrogen acts reducing agent because donates its electrons which allows fluorine half reactions importance reducing and oxidizing agents reducing agents and oxidizing agents are the ones responsible for corrosion which the degradation metals result electrochemical corrosion requires anode and cathode take the anode element that loses electrons reducing thus oxidation always occurs the and the cathode element that gains electrons oxidizing thus reduction always occurs the corrosion occurs whenever difference oxidation when this the anode metal begins given there electrical connection and the presence electrolyte example redox reaction the formation oxide the above the iron has oxidation number before and after the for oxygen the oxidation number began and decreased these changes can viewed two half reactions that occur oxidation half reduction half iron has been oxidized because the oxidation number iron the reducing agent because gave electrons the oxygen oxygen has been reduced because the oxidation number has decreased and the oxidizing agent because took electrons from iron ferric common reducing agents lithium aluminum hydride lialh nascent hydrogen sodium amalgam diborane sodium borohydride nabh compounds containing the ion such tin chloride sulfite compounds hydrazine wolff kishner reduction zinc mercury amalgam clemmensen reduction diisobutylaluminum hydride lindlar catalyst oxalic acid formic acid ascorbic acid phosphites hypophosphites and phosphorous acid dithiothreitol used biochemistry labs avoid bonds compounds containing the ion such iron sulfate carbon monoxide carbon tris phosphine hcl tcep several common reducing agents and their products hydrogen nadh hydrocarbons carbon dioxide see also organic reduction oxidizing agent electrochemistry electrosynthesis corrosion electrolyte redox
