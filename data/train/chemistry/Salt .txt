crystalline mineral known rock salt halite salt present vast quantities the sea where the main mineral with the open ocean having about grams solids per salinity salt essential for animal life and saltiness one the basic human tastes the tissues animals contain larger quantities salt than plant therefore the typical diets nomads who subsist their flocks and herds require little added whereas based diets require salt one the oldest and most ubiquitous food and salting important method food preservation some the earliest evidence salt processing dates back around years when people living romania were boiling spring water extract the saltworks china has been found which dates approximately the same salt was prized the ancient the the the the hittites and the salt became important article trade and was transported boat across the mediterranean along specially built salt and across the sahara camel the scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations war over salt and use raise tax salt also used religious ceremonies and has other cultural salt produced from salt mines the evaporation seawater rich spring water shallow its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine and used many industrial processes and the manufacture polyvinyl chloride plastics paper pulp and many other the annual production around two hundred million tonnes only about used for human other uses include water conditioning icing highways and agricultural edible salt sold forms such sea salt and table salt which usually contains anti caking agent and may iodised prevent iodine deficiency well its use cooking and the salt present many processed too much sodium the diet raises blood pressure and may increase the risk heart attacks and strokes the world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than sodium which equivalent grams salt per halite contents history chemistry edible salt fortified table salt other kinds salt food diet and health non

the river salzach central austria area with extensive salt salzach literally means salt and salzburg salt both taking their names from the german word salz meaning salt and hallstatt was the site the first salt mine the town gave its name the hallstatt culture that began mining for salt the area about around the who had previously used pickaxes and shovels began open pan salt making during the first millennium celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat ancient greece and ancient rome exchange for wine and other the word salary originates from latin salarium which referred the money paid the roman army soldiers for the purchase the word salad literally means salted and comes from the ancient roman practice salting leaf vegetables wars have been fought over venice fought and won war with genoa over the and played important part the american revolution cities overland trade routes grew rich levying duties and towns like liverpool flourished the export salt extracted from the salt mines various governments have different times imposed salt taxes their the voyages christopher columbus are said have been financed from salt production southern and the oppressive salt tax france was one the causes the french revolution after being this tax was reimposed napoleon when became emperor pay for his foreign and was not finally abolished until mahatma gandhi led least people the dandi salt satyagraha which protesters made their own salt from the sea thus defying british rule and avoiding paying the salt tax this civil disobedience inspired millions common and elevated the indian independence movement from elitist movement national chemistry sem sodium chloride sodium ionic compound with the formula nacl representing equal proportions sodium and chlorine salt crystals

fishy odour the latter from organobromine compounds sediments the proportion which varies with the give the salt dull grey since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable humans minute sea salt may have more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled top when salt added during cooking these flavours would likely overwhelmed those the food the refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts not contain enough iodine salts prevent iodine deficiency diseases different natural salts have different mineralities depending their giving each one unique fleur sel natural sea salt from the surface evaporating brine salt has unique flavour varying with the region from which traditional korean cuisine called bamboo salt prepared roasting salt bamboo container plugged with mud both this product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the and has been claimed increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties doenjang fermented bean kosher salt though contains iodine and has much larger grain size than most refined this can give different properties when used and can useful for preparing kosher meat some kosher salt has been certified meet kosher requirements hechsher but this not true for all products labelled kosher salt food salt present most but naturally occurring foodstuffs such vegetables and present very small often added processed foods make their flavour more appealing and also present higher levels preserved thus herring contains sodium per while kipper its preserved contains similarly pork typically contains while bacon contains and potatoes contain but potato crisps per the main sources salt the apart from direct use sodium are bread and cereal meat products and milk and dairy many east asian salt not traditionally used its condiments such soy sauce fish sauce and oyster sauce tend have high sodium content and fill similar role table salt western they are most often used for cooking rather than table diet and health health effects salt table salt made just under sodium serving teaspoon contains about sodium serves useful purpose the human helps nerves and muscles function and one the factors involved the regulation water content fluid balance most the sodium the western diet comes from the habitual salt intake many western countries about per and higher than that many countries eastern europe and the high level sodium many processed foods has major impact the total amount the united the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant from cooking and table use and the rest from what found naturally too much sodium appears bad for and health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake high salt intake associated with greater risk stroke and total cardiovascular disease susceptible direct however unclear low salt diet affects overall cardiovascular related adults and children with acute decrease the intake sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood low salt diet results greater improvement blood pressure those with hypertension than those the world health organization recommends that all adults should consume less than sodium which equivalent per day with some advocating for less than sodium per there insufficient evidence show that there additional benefit lowering sodium intake less than per those with heart failure very low sodium diet may worse than diet with slightly more non dietary uses sodium chloride only about the salt manufactured the world used the used water conditioning goes for icing highways and used the rest used for manufacturing and other industrial and sodium chloride one the largest inorganic raw materials used its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine which are separated the electrolysis pure brine these are used the manufacture pvc plastics paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic salt also used flux the production aluminium for this layer melted salt floats top the molten metal and removes iron and other metal also used the manufacture soaps and glycerine where added the vat precipitate out the saponified products salt used the manufacture synthetic rubber and another use the firing pottery when salt added the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface the ceramic forming strong glaze when drilling through loose materials such sand salt may added the boring mud provide stable wall prevent the hole there are many other processes which salt these include its use mordant textile dying regenerate resins water for the tanning the preservation meat and fish and the canning meat and production list countries salt production brine salt wells kluea nan province salar uyuni the manufacture salt one the oldest chemical major source salt which has salinity approximately this means that there are about grams dissolved salts predominantly sodium and chloride ions per kilogram the oceans are virtually inexhaustible source and this abundance supply means that reserves have not been the evaporation seawater the production method choice marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can harvested the water dries sometimes these ponds have vivid some species algae and other organisms thrive conditions high elsewhere salt extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation seas and these are either mined directly producing rock are extracted solution pumping water into the either the salt may purified mechanical evaporation traditionally this was done shallow open pans which were heated increase the rate more the process performed pans under vacuum the raw salt refined purify and improve its storage and handling this usually involves recrystallization during which brine solution treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities largely magnesium and calcium multiple stages evaporation are then used collect pure sodium chloride which are kiln some salt produced using the alberger process which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding the solution with cubic and produces type the ayoreo indigenous group from the paraguayan chaco obtain their salt from the ash produced burning the timber the indian salt tree maytenus idaea and other one the

the upper extraction himalayan salt expected last years the present rate extraction around tons per total world production sodium chloride not just table was estimated million tonnes the top five producers being the united states million china germany india and canada during the period global production salt increased per and china took over the largest producing nation its chemical industry food grade salt accounts for only small part salt production industrialized countries although food uses account for salt usage religion bread and salt salt has long held important place religion and the time brahmanic sacrifices hittite rituals and during festivals held semites and greeks the time the new moon salt was thrown into fire where produced crackling the ancient greeks and romans invoked their gods with offerings salt and water and some people think this the origin holy water the christian aztec mythology huixtocihuatl was fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt one
