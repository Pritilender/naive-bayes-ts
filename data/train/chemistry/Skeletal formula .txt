chemistry	skeletal formula skeletal model navigation search skeleton antidepressant escitalopram heteroatoms triple bond phenyl groups stereochemistry the skeletal formula sometimes called line angle formula organic compound type molecular structural formula that serves shorthand representation its bonding and some details its molecular geometry represented two page employs certain conventions represent carbon and hydrogen atoms which are the most common organic the technique was developed the organic chemist friedrich august von stradonitz skeletal formulae have become ubiquitous organic chemistry partly because they are relatively quick and simple carbon atoms are usually depicted line ends vertices with the assumption that all carbons have valence and hydrogen usually not shown are assumed complete each skeletal formula shows the skeletal structure skeleton which composed the skeletal atoms that make the contents the skeleton implicit carbon and hydrogen atoms explicit heteroatoms pseudoelement symbols elements alkyl groups aromatic substituents functional groups leaving groups multiple bonds benzene rings stereochemistry hydrogen bonds references external links the skeleton the skeletal structure organic compound the series atoms bonded together that form the essential structure the the skeleton can consist branches rings bonded skeletal atoms other than carbon hydrogen are called heteroatoms the skeleton has hydrogen various substituents bonded its hydrogen the most common carbon atom that bonded carbon for not explicitly carbon atoms are not generally labeled such directly with whereas heteroatoms are always explicitly noted such using for nitrogen for oxygen etc heteroatoms and other groups atoms that give rise relatively high rates chemical introduce specific and interesting characteristics the spectra disambiguation needed compounds are called functional groups they give the molecule heteroatoms and functional groups are known collectively substituents they are considered substitute for the hydrogen atom that would present the parent hydrocarbon the organic compound implicit carbon and hydrogen atoms for the image the skeletal formula hexane the carbon atom labeled appears have only one there must also three hydrogens bonded order make its total number bonds the carbon atom labelled has two bonds other carbons and therefore bonded two hydrogen atoms ball stick model the actual molecular structure determined ray crystallography shown for which carbon atoms are depicted black balls and hydrogen atoms white note matter which end the chain you start numbering long consistent when drawing the condensed formula the iupac name will confirm the some molecules will become familiar regardless the any hydrogen atoms bonded carbon atoms are drawn ethanol for the hydrogen atom bonded oxygen denoted the symbol whereas the hydrogen atoms which are bonded carbon atoms are not shown lines representing hydrogen bonds are usually omitted for clarity and functional group like the hydroxyl group most often written instead these bonds are sometimes drawn out full order accentuate their presence when they participate reaction mechanisms shown below for comparison are stick model the actual dimensional structure the ethanol molecule the gas phase determined microwave spectroscopy left the lewis structure and the skeletal formula explicit heteroatoms all atoms that are not carbon hydrogen are signified their chemical symbol for instance for chlorine for oxygen and for sodium these atoms are commonly known heteroatoms the context organic pseudoelement symbols there are also symbols that appear chemical element symbols but represent certain very common substituents indicate unspecified member group these are known pseudoelement symbols organic the most widely used symbol which represents the phenyl group list pseudoelement symbols shown elements for any halogen atom for any metal atom for deuterium atom for tritium atom alkyl groups for any alkyl group even any substituent all for the methyl group for the ethyl group for the propyl group for the isopropyl group for the butyl group for the isobutyl group for the secondary butyl group for the tertiary butyl group for the pentyl group for the hexyl group for the heptyl group for the cyclohexyl group aromatic substituents for any aromatic substituent for the benzyl group for the benzoyl group mes for the mesityl group for the phenyl group tol for the tolyl group for the cyclopentadienyl group for the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group functional groups for the acetyl group also the symbol for the element actinium however actinium almost never encountered organic the use represent the acetyl group never causes leaving groups see the article leaving group for further information for the brosyl group for the nosyl group for the trifyl group for tosyl group multiple bonds two atoms can bonded sharing more than one pair the common bonds carbon are double and triple single bonds are most common and are represented solid line between two atoms skeletal double bonds are denoted two parallel and triple bonds are shown three parallel more advanced theories non integer values bond order exist these combination solid and dashed lines indicate the integer and integer parts the bond respectively carbon carbon double bond hex ene hex yne carbon triple bond the gallery double bonds have been shown red and triple bonds this was added for clarity multiple bonds are not normally coloured skeletal benzene rings benzene rings are common organic compounds represent the delocalization electrons over the six carbon atoms the circle drawn inside the hexagon single this style very common introductory organic chemistry texts used alternative style that more common academia the kekul structure although could considered inaccurate implies three single bonds and three double bonds benzene would therefore all qualified chemists are fully aware the delocalization kekul structures are useful for drawing reaction mechanisms clearly stereochemistry stereochemistry conveniently denoted skeletal ball stick model amphetamine the relevant chemical bonds can depicted several solid lines represent bonds the plane the paper solid wedges represent bonds that point out the plane the paper towards the hashed wedges dashed lines thick represent bonds that point into the plane the paper away from the wavy lines represent either unknown stereochemistry mixture the two possible stereoisomers that early use this notation can traced back richard kuhn who used solid thick lines and dotted lines the modern wedges were popularised the textbook organic donald cram and george hammond skeletal formulae can depict cis and trans isomers wavy single bonds are the standard way represent unknown unspecified stereochemistry mixture isomers with tetrahedeal crossed bond has been used longer considered acceptable style for general but may still required computer hydrogen bonds acetic acid hydrogen bonds are generally denoted dotted dashed
