ammonium bicarbonate potassium bicarbonate sodium bisulfate sodium hydrogen phosphate standard state what references sodium bicarbonate sodium hydrogen carbonate the chemical compound with the formula hco sodium bicarbonate white solid that crystalline but often appears fine has slightly alkaline taste resembling that washing soda sodium carbonate the natural mineral form nahcolite component the mineral natron and found dissolved many mineral springs among the food additives encoded european union identified the initials since has long been known and widely the salt has many related names such baking soda bread soda cooking soda and bicarbonate soda colloquial its name sometimes shortened sodium bicarb bicarb soda simply bicarb even bica the word saleratus from latin sal ratus meaning aerated salt was widely used the century for both sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate the term has now fallen out common sodium bicarbonate usually called baking soda general contents history production mining chemistry thermal decomposition applications fire extinguisher cooking neutralization acids and bases medical uses personal hygiene sports cleaning agent biopesticide cattle feed supplements popular culture film difference between baking soda and baking powder see also references further reading external links history the ancient egyptians used natural deposits natron mixture consisting mostly sodium carbonate decahydrate and sodium the natron was used cleansing agent like soap french nicolas leblanc produced sodium also known soda ash two new york john dwight and austin established the first factory develop baking soda from sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide this referred mentioned the famous novel captains courageous rudyard kipling being used extensively the commercial fishing prevent caught fish from production solvay process nahco mainly prepared the solvay process which the reaction sodium chloride ammonia and carbon dioxide calcium carbonate used the source and the resultant calcium oxide used recover the ammonia from the ammonium chloride the product shows low purity pure product obtained from sodium water and carbon dioxide reported one the following produced the scale about tonnes year nahco may obtained the reaction carbon dioxide with aqueous solution sodium hydroxide the initial reaction produces sodium carbonate further addition carbon dioxide produces sodium which sufficiently high concentration will precipitate out commercial quantities baking soda are also produced similar soda mined the form the ore trona dissolved water and treated with carbon sodium bicarbonate precipitates solid from this mining naturally occurring deposits nahcolite nahco are found the eocene age green river formation piceance basin colorado nahcolite was deposited beds during periods high evaporation the commercially mined using situ leach techniques involving dissolution the nahcolite heated water that pumped through the nahcolite beds and reconstituted through natural cooling crystallization chemistry sodium bicarbonate amphoteric compound aqueous solutions are mildly alkaline due the formation carbonic acid and hydroxide ion sodium bicarbonate can used wash remove any acidic impurities from crude liquid producing purer reaction sodium bicarbonate and acid produce salt and carbonic which readily decomposes carbon dioxide and sodium bicarbonate reacts with acetic acid found vinegar producing sodium acetate water and carbon dioxide sodium bicarbonate reacts with bases such sodium hydroxide form carbonates sodium bicarbonate reacts with carboxyl groups proteins give brisk effervescence from the formation this reaction used test for the presence carboxylic groups citation needed thermal decomposition above sodium bicarbonate gradually decomposes into sodium carbonate water and carbon dioxide the conversion fast most bicarbonates undergo this dehydration reaction further heating converts the carbonate into the oxide over these conversions are relevant the use nahco suppression agent some dry powder fire extinguishers applications sodium bicarbonate used process for removing paint and corrosion called sodablasting the process particularly suitable for cleaning aluminium panels which can distorted other types can administered spas and garden ponds raise levels has weak disinfectant properties and may effective fungicide against some because baking soda will absorb musty has become reliable method for book sellers when making books less fire extinguisher sodium bicarbonate can used extinguish small grease electrical fires being thrown over the however should not applied fires deep fryers may cause the grease sodium bicarbonate used dry chemical fire extinguishers alternative the more corrosive ammonium phosphate abc the alkali nature sodium bicarbonate makes the only dry chemical besides purple that was used scale fire suppression systems installed commercial because can act the agent has mild saponification effect hot which forms smothering soapy cooking leavening agent sodium referred baking primarily used cooking baking leavening agent reacts with acidic components releasing carbon which causes expansion the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain cakes quick soda and other baked and fried acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates cream tartar lemon juice yogurt buttermilk cocoa vinegar etc sodium bicarbonate can substituted for baking powder provided sufficient acid reagent also added the many forms baking powder contain sodium bicarbonate combined with calcium acid sodium aluminum sulphate cream sodium bicarbonate was sometimes used cooking make them although this has gone out most people now prefer firmer however still used asian and latin american cuisine tenderise baking soda may react with acids including vitamin ascorbic also used breadings such for fried foods enhance heat causes sodium bicarbonate act raising agent releasing carbon dioxide when used the carbon dioxide production starts temperatures above since the reaction does not occur room mixtures cake etc can allowed stand without rising until they are heated the neutralization acids and bases many laboratories keep bottle sodium bicarbonate powder within easy because sodium bicarbonate amphoteric reacting with acids and bases furthermore relatively innocuous most there harm using excess sodium also sodium bicarbonate powder may used smother small heating sodium bicarbonate releases carbon wide variety applications follows from its neutralization including reducing the spread white phosphorus from incendiary bullets inside afflicted medical citation needed medical uses sodium bicarbonate mixed with water can used antacid treat acid indigestion and heartburn used the medicinal ingredient gripe water for intravenous sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution that sometimes used for cases acidosis when there are insufficient sodium bicarbonate ions the cases respiratory the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic bicarbonate buffer plasma the left thus raises the for this reason that sodium bicarbonate used medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation infusion bicarbonate indicated only when the blood markedly low used for treatment hyperkalemia medical citation needed since sodium bicarbonate can cause alkalosis sometimes used treat aspirin aspirin requires acidic environment for proper and the basic environment diminishes aspirin absorption the case medical citation needed sodium bicarbonate has also been used the treatment tricyclic antidepressant overdose can also applied topically with three parts baking soda one part relieve some kinds insect bites and stings well accompanying adverse reactions the administration sodium bicarbonate can include metabolic alkalosis edema due sodium congestive heart failure hyperosmolar syndrome hypervolemic hypernatremia and hypertension due increased patients consuming calcium rich calcium supplements containing antacids such calcium carbonate tums the use sodium bicarbonate can cause milk alkali syndrome which can result metastatic calcification kidney stones and kidney sodium bicarbonate can used treat allergic reaction plants such poison ivy oak sumac relieve some the associated bicarbonate soda can also useful removing splinters from the some alternative such tullio simoncini have promoted baking soda cancer cure which the american cancer society has warned against due both its unproven effectiveness and potential danger personal hygiene toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate has several studies shown have better whitening and plaque removal effect than toothpastes without sodium bicarbonate also used ingredient some has caries and abrasive works mechanical cleanser the teeth and neutralizes the production acid the mouth and also acts antiseptic help prevent citation needed sodium bicarbonate combination with other ingredients can used make dry wet deodorant may also used sodium bicarbonate may used buffering combined with table when creating solution for nasal irrigation sports small amounts sodium bicarbonate have been shown useful supplement for athletes based like middle distance lasting from about one seven however overdose serious risk because sodium bicarbonate slightly gastrointestinal irritation particular additionally this practice causes significant increase dietary cleaning agent paste from baking soda can very effective when used cleaning and for cleaning aluminium the use sodium bicarbonate discouraged attacks the thin unreactive protective oxide layer this otherwise very reactive solution warm water will remove the tarnish from silver when the silver contact with piece aluminium foil paste sodium bicarbonate and water useful removing surface rust the rust forms water soluble compound when concentrated alkaline cold water should used hot water solutions can corrode baking soda commonly added washing machines replacement for softener and remove odors from sodium bicarbonate also effective removing heavy tea and coffee stains from cups when diluted with warm during the manhattan project develop the atomic bomb the early many scientists investigated the toxic properties they found that uranium oxides stick very well cotton but did not wash out with soap laundry the uranium would wash out with solution sodium bicarbonate baking clothing can become contaminated with depleted uranium dust and normal laundering will not remove those risk dust exposure should have their clothing washed with baking soda about ounces baking soda gallons biopesticide sodium bicarbonate can effective way controlling fungus and the united states registered the environmental protection agency biopesticide cattle feed supplements sodium bicarbonate sold cattle feed particular buffering agent for the rumen popular culture film sodium bicarbonate was frequent source punch lines for groucho marx marx brothers movies duck soup marx plays the leader nation one receives message from the battlefield that his general reporting gas and groucho tells his tell him take teaspoonful bicarbonate soda and half glass night the opera groucho character addresses the opening night crowd opera saying the lead signor lassparri comes from very famous his mother was known bass his father was the first man stuff spaghetti with bicarbonate thus causing and curing indigestion the same difference between baking soda and baking powder comparison baking powder baking soda more alkaline and requires acid avoid the metallic taste when the chemical change creates sodium baking the other contains baking powdered acid and scientific baking soda pure baking powder baking soda used something acidic must added avoid the metallic taste sodium carbonate but with baking non acid ingredients such whole milk processed cocoa must added avoid the flavouring acidic see also carbonic acid irish soda bread list ineffective cancer treatments list minerals nahcolite natron natrona trona washing soda
