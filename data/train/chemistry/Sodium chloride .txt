framework disintegrates the and ions become surrounded the polar water these solutions consist metal aquo complex with the formula with the distance the chloride ions are also strongly each being surrounded average molecules solutions sodium chloride have very different properties from pure the freezing point for and the boiling point saturated salt solution near from cold salt crystallises the dihydrate nacl unexpected stable stoichiometric variants common salt has established molar ratio sodium and compounds sodium and chloride different stoichiometries have been discovered team stony brook five new compounds were predicted nacl and nacl the existence some them has been tested and experimentally cubic and orthorhombic nacl and dimensional metallic tetragonal this indicates that compounds violating chemical intuition are simple systems under nonambient occurrence small particles sea salt are the dominant cloud condensation nuclei well out which allow the formation clouds otherwise non polluted air production mount morris new york united states salt currently mass produced evaporation seawater brine from brine wells and salt lakes mining rock salt also major china the main supplier world production was estimated million tonnes the top five producers million being china united states germany india and canada salt also byproduct potassium mining uses addition the familiar domestic uses more dominant applications the approximately megatons year production data include chemicals and chemicals production salt the directly for the production many which consume most the chlor alkali industry chloralkali process the starting point for the chloralkali process which provides the world with chlorine and sodium hydroxide according the chemical equation this electrolysis conducted either mercury diaphragm membrane each those use different method separate the chlorine from the sodium other technologies are under development due the high energy consumption the whereby small improvements the efficiency can have large economic some applications chlorine include pvc disinfectants and sodium hydroxide enables industries that produce soap and soda ash industry via the solvay process sodium chloride used produce sodium carbonate and calcium chloride sodium carbonate used produce glass sodium bicarbonate and dyes well myriad other the mannheim process and the hargreaves process used for the production sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid standard sodium chloride has international standard that created astm international the standard named astm and the standard test methods for chemical analysis sodium these methods listed provide procedures for analyzing sodium chloride determine suitable for its intended use and miscellaneous industrial uses sodium chloride heavily even miscellaneous applications can consume massive oil and gas salt important component drilling fluids well used flocculate and increase the density the drilling fluid overcome high downwell gas whenever drill hits salt salt added the drilling fluid saturate the solution and minimize the dissolution within the salt salt also used increase the curing concrete cemented textiles and salt used brine rinse separate organic promote salting dyestuff and blend with concentrated dyes standardize one its main roles provide the positive ion charge promote the absorption negatively charged ions also used processing aluminium beryllium copper steel and vanadium the pulp and paper industry salt used bleach wood also used make sodium chlorate which added along with sulfuric acid and water manufacture chlorine dioxide excellent based bleaching chemical the chlorine dioxide which originated germany after world war becoming more popular because environmental pressures reduce eliminate chlorinated bleaching tanning and leather salt added animal hides inhibit microbial activity the underside the hides and attract moisture back into the rubber salt used make buna neoprene and white rubber salt brine and sulfuric acid are used coagulate emulsified latex made from chlorinated butadiene salt also added secure the soil and provide firmness the foundation which highways are the salt acts minimize the effects shifting caused the subsurface changes humidity and traffic water softening hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions that interfere with action soap and contribute the buildup scale film alkaline mineral deposits household and industrial equipment and commercial and residential softening units use ion exchange resins remove the offending ions that cause the these resins are generated and regenerated using sodium road salt the second major application salt for icing and icing both grit bins and spread winter service vehicles anticipation roads are optimally with brine concentrated solution salt which prevents bonding between the ice and the road this procedure obviates the heavy use salt after the for mixtures brine and salt are sometimes with additional agents such calcium and magnesium chloride the use salt brine becomes ineffective below salt for icing the united kingdom predominantly comes from single mine winsford cheshire prior distribution mixed with ppm sodium caking which enables rock salt flow freely out the gritting vehicles despite being stockpiled prior recent years this additive has also been used table other additives had been used road salt reduce the total for the byproduct carbohydrate solution from sugar beet processing was mixed with rock salt and adhered road surfaces about better than loose rock salt because stayed the road the treatment did not have repeated several saving time and the technical terms physical the minimum freezing point salt mixture for freezing near this concentration however slow that the eutectic point can reached with about environmental effects road salt ends fresh water bodies and could harm aquatic plants and animals disrupting their osmoregulation ability the omnipresence salt poses problem any coastal coating trapped salts cause great problems naval authorities and ship builders monitor the salt concentrations surfaces during maximum salt concentrations surfaces are dependent the authority and the imo regulation mostly used and sets salt levels maximum soluble salts measured sodium these measurements are done means bresle test highway salt has been associated with corrosion bridge motor reinforcement bar and and unprotected steel structures used road surface vehicle and windblown actions also affect roadside and local surface water and groundwater although evidence environmental loading salt has been found during peak the spring rains and thaws usually dilute the concentrations sodium the area where salt was food medicine and agriculture salt many micro organisms cannot live overly salty water drawn out their cells osmosis for this reason salt used preserve some such smoked fish can also used detach leeches that have attached themselves also used disinfect wounds citation needed salt added either the food producer the flavor preservative binder fermentation control texture control agent and color the salt consumption the food industry descending order into other food meat canning baking dairy and grain mill salt added promote color development ham and other processed meat salt inhibits the growth salt acts binder sausages form binding gel made fat and salt also acts flavor enhancer and tenderizer many dairy salt added cheese fermentation and control the dairy subsector includes companies that manufacture creamery condensed and evaporated frozen ice natural and processed and specialty dairy salt primarily added flavor enhancer and preservative also used carrier for other dehydrating enzyme inhibitor and salt added control the rate fermentation bread also used strengthen the gluten the elastic water complex certain and flavor such topping baked the processing category also contains grain mill these products consist milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended prepared salt also used seasoning potato pretzels cat and dog sodium chloride used veterinary medicine emesis causing given warm saturated emesis can also caused pharyngeal placement small amount plain salt salt firefighting sodium chloride the principal extinguishing agent fire extinguishers super used combustible metal fires such potassium sodium and nak alloys class thermoplastic powder added the along with waterproofing metal and caking materials tricalcium form the extinguishing when applied the the salt acts like heat dissipating heat from the and also forms excluding crust smother the the plastic additive melts and helps the crust maintain its integrity until the burning metal cools below its ignition this type extinguisher was invented the late the operated type shown although stored pressure versions are now common sizes are pounds portable and pounds wheeled cleanser since least medieval times people have used salt cleansing agent rubbed household also used many brands shampoo toothpaste and popularly ice driveways and patches optical usage defect free nacl crystals have optical transmittance about between and they were therefore used optical components windows and operating the infrared spectral where few absorbing alternatives exist and where requirements for absence microscopic inhomogeneities are less strict than the visible while nacl crystals are soft and hygroscopic when exposed the ambient air they gradually cover with frost this limits application nacl dry environments for term uses such nowadays materials like zinc selenide which are stronger mechanically and are less sensitive are used instead nacl for the spectral biological functions salt the long held belief that salt diet raises the risk cardio vascular disease coming under more dietary salt was demonstrated attenuate nitric oxide production nitric oxide
