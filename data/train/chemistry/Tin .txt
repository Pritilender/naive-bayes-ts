life less than the radioactive one the few nuclides possessing doubly magic nucleus and was discovered relatively another metastable isomers have been characterized for isotopes between and the most stable which being with life years etymology the word tin shared among germanic languages and can traced back reconstructed proto germanic cognates include german zinn swedish tenn and dutch tin not found other branches indo european except borrowing from germanic irish tinne from the latin name stannum originally meant alloy silver and and came mean the century bce the earlier latin word for was plumbum candidum white stannum apparently came from earlier gnum meaning the same the origin the romance and celtic terms for the origin stannum gnum may indo european the meyers konversationslexikon speculates the contrary that stannum derived from the ancestor cornish stean and proof that cornwall the first centuries was the main source history tin sources and trade ancient times dirk tin extraction and use can dated the beginnings the bronze age around when was observed that copper objects formed polymetallic ores with different metal contents had different physical the earliest bronze objects had tin arsenic content less than and are therefore believed the result unintentional alloying due trace metal content the copper the addition second metal copper increases its lowers the melting and improves the casting process producing more fluid melt that cools less spongy this was important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast closed moulds the bronze arsenical bronze objects appear first the near east where arsenic commonly found association with copper but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources the much less hazardous tin ores began early the bronze this created the demand for rare tin metal and formed trade network that linked the distant sources tin the markets bronze age cultures citation needed cassiterite sno the tin oxide form was most likely the original source tin ancient other forms tin ores are less abundant sulfides such stannite that require more involved smelting process cassiterite often accumulates alluvial channels placer deposits due the fact that heavier and more chemically resistant than the granite which typically these deposits can easily seen river banks cassiterite usually purple otherwise dark feature exploited early bronze age prospectors likely that the earliest deposits were alluvial and perhaps exploited the same methods used for panning gold placer deposits citation needed compounds and chemistry category tin compounds the great majority its tin has the oxidation state inorganic compounds halide compounds are known for both oxidation for all four halides are well snf sncl snbr and sni the three heavier members are volatile molecular whereas the tetrafluoride all four halides are known for also snf sncl snbr and sni all are polymeric these eight only the iodides are tin chloride also known stannous the most important tin halide commercial illustrating the routes such chlorine reacts with tin metal give sncl whereas the reaction hydrochloric acid and tin gives sncl and hydrogen alternatively sncl and combine stannous chloride via process called comproportionation tin can form many sulfides and other chalcogenide the dioxide sno forms when tin heated the presence air sno amphoteric which means that dissolves both acidic and basic there are also stannates with the structure like although the free stannic acid the sulfides tin exist both the and oxidation tin sulfide and tin sulfide mosaic gold ball stick models stannous chloride hydrides stannane snh where tin the oxidation organotin hydrides are however well tributyltin hydride these compound release transient tributyl tin rare examples compounds organotin compounds organotin compounds sometimes called are chemical compounds with carbon the compounds the organic derivatives are the most useful some organotin compounds are highly toxic and have been used biocides the first organotin compound reported was diethyltin diiodide sni reported edward frankland most organotin compounds are colorless liquids solids that are stable air and they adopt tetrahedral tetraalkyl and tetraaryltin compounds can prepared using grignard reagents sncl the mixed which are more common and more important commercially than the tetraorgano are prepared redistribution reactions sncl divalent organotin compounds are although more common than related divalent organogermanium and organosilicon compounds the greater stabilization enjoyed attributed the inert pair effect organotin compounds include both stannylenes seen for singlet carbenes and distannylenes which are roughly equivalent alkenes both classes exhibit unusual occurrence category tin minerals ore placer mining tin generated via the long process medium mass stars with masses times that sun arises via beta decay heavy isotopes indium tin the most abundant element the earth crust representing ppm compared with ppm for ppm for and ppm for tin does not occur the native element but must extracted from various cassiterite sno the only commercially important source although small quantities tin are recovered from complex sulfides such stannite cylindrite franckeite canfieldite and teallite minerals with tin are almost always associated with granite rock usually level tin oxide because the higher specific gravity tin about mined tin from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary tin often recovered from granules washed downstream the past and deposited valleys under the most economical ways mining tin are through dredging hydraulic methods open cast mining most the tin produced from placer deposits which may contain little tin china malaysia peru indonesia brazil bolivia russia thailand australia about tonnes tin have been mined mostly china indonesia peru bolivia and brazil estimates tin production have historically varied with the dynamics economic feasibility and the development mining but estimated current consumption rates and the earth will run out tin that can mined years however lester brown has suggested tin could run out within years based extremely conservative extrapolation growth per secondary tin also important source the the recovery tin through secondary recycling scrap increasing whereas the united states has neither mined since nor smelted tin since was the largest secondary recycling nearly tonnes new deposits are reported southern mongolia and new deposits tin were discovered the seminole group colombia sas production tin produced carbothermic reduction the oxide ore with carbon both reverberatory furnace and electric furnace can mining and smelting tin mining industry the ten largest companies produced most the tin not clear which these companies include tin smelted from the mine democratic republic the which controlled renegade militia and produces tonnes most the tin traded the london metal exchange from countries under brands yunnan tin price and exchanges tin unique among other mineral commodities the complex agreements between producer countries and consumer countries dating back the earlier agreements tended somewhat informal and they led the first international tin the first continuously numbered series that essentially collapsed through this series the international tin council had considerable effect tin the itc supported the price tin during periods low prices buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able restrain the price during periods high prices selling tin from the this was market designed assure sufficient flow tin consumer countries and decent profit for producer however the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently and during most those years tin prices sometimes especially from through when rampant inflation plagued many world during the late and early the government tin stockpile was aggressive selling partly take advantage the historically high tin the sharp recession proved quite harsh the tin tin consumption declined the itc was able avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer this activity required the itc borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms augment its the itc continued borrow until late when reached its credit immediately major tin followed tin was delisted from trading the london metal exchange for about years the itc dissolved soon and the price now market plummeted sharply per pound and remained around this level through increased again due rebound consumption following the world economic restocking and continued growth consumption the developing london metal exchange the principal trading site for
