hydroxycarbamide carbamide peroxide urea phosphate standard state what references urea carbamide organic compound with the chemical formula the molecule has two groups joined carbonyl functional group urea serves important role the metabolism containing compounds animals and the main containing substance the urine mammals odorless highly soluble water and practically toxic for dissolved neither acidic nor alkaline the body uses many the most notable one being nitrogen urea widely used fertilizers convenient source urea also important raw material for the chemical industry the discovery friedrich hler that urea can produced from inorganic starting materials was important conceptual milestone showed for the first time that substance previously known only byproduct life could synthesized the laboratory without any biological starting contradicting the widely held doctrine vitalism contents related compounds history physiology humans other species production industrial methods synthesis the stripping concept side reactions corrosion finishing solid forms uan solutions laboratory preparation historical process chemical properties molecular and crystal structure

used for class chemical compounds sharing the same functional group namely carbonyl group attached two organic amine examples include carbamide peroxide allantoin and hydantoin ureas are closely related biurets and related structure amides carbamates carbodiimides and thiocarbamides history urea was first discovered urine the dutch scientist herman boerhaave though this discovery often attributed the french chemist hilaire rouelle the german chemist friedrich hler obtained urea artificially treating silver cyanate with ammonium chloride this was the first time organic compound was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting without the involvement living the results this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism the theory that the chemicals living organisms are fundamentally different from those inanimate this insight was important for the development organic chemistry his discovery prompted hler write triumphantly berzelius must tell you that can make urea without the use either man ammonium cyanate for this hler considered many the father organic physiology urea synthesized the body many organisms part the urea cycle either from the oxidation amino acids from ammonia this amino groups donated ammonia and aspartate are converted while ornithine citrulline argininosuccinate and arginine act urea production occurs the liver and regulated acetylglutamate urea then dissolved into the blood the reference range and further transported and excreted the kidney component urine small amount urea excreted along with sodium chloride and sweat amino acids from ingested food that are not used for the synthesis proteins and other biological substances are oxidized the yielding urea and carbon dioxide alternative source the oxidation pathway starts with the removal the amino group transaminase the amino group then fed into the urea ammonia another common byproduct the metabolism nitrogenous ammonia more volatile and more mobile than allowed ammonia would raise the cells toxic therefore many organisms convert ammonia even though this synthesis has net energy being practically neutral and highly soluble urea safe vehicle for the body transport and excrete excess the amine groups undergo slow displacement water producing ammonium ion and bicarbonate ion for this old stale urine has stronger odor than fresh humans the handling urea the kidneys vital part mammalian besides its role carrier waste urea also plays role the countercurrent exchange system the nephrons that allows for absorption water and critical ions from the excreted urine urea reabsorbed the inner medullary collecting ducts the thus raising the osmolarity the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin ascending limb the loop henle which turn causes water action the urea transporter some this reabsorbed urea will eventually flow back into the thin ascending limb the through the collecting and into the excreted this which controlled the antidiuretic hormone allows the body create hyperosmotic urine that has higher concentration dissolved substances than the blood plasma this mechanism important prevent the loss maintain blood pressure and maintain suitable concentration sodium ions the blood the equivalent nitrogen content gram urea mmol can estimated the conversion factor furthermore gram nitrogen roughly equivalent grams protein and gram protein roughly equivalent grams muscle tissue situations such muscle wasting mmol excessive urea the urine measured urine volume litres multiplied urea concentration roughly corresponds muscle loss other species aquatic organisms the most common form nitrogen waste whereas dwelling organisms convert the toxic ammonia either urea uric acid urea found the urine mammals and amphibians well some fish birds and saurian reptiles have different form nitrogen metabolism that requires less water and leads nitrogen excretion the form uric acid noteworthy that tadpoles excrete ammonia but shift urea production during metamorphosis despite the generalization the urea pathway has been documented not only mammals and amphibians but many other organisms including invertebrates insects plants yeast fungi and even microorganisms citation needed production urea produced industrial worldwide production capacity was approximately million industrial methods for use urea produced from synthetic ammonia and carbon dioxide large quantities carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia manufacturing process byproduct from hydrocarbons predominantly natural less often petroleum occasionally from urea production plants are almost always located adjacent the site where the ammonia although natural gas both the most economical and the most widely available ammonia plant plants using not produce quite much carbon dioxide from the process needed convert their entire ammonia output into recent years new technologies such the cdr process have been developed recover supplementary carbon dioxide from the combustion exhaust gases produced the fired reforming furnace the ammonia synthesis gas allowing operators alone nitrogen fertilizer complexes avoid the need handle and market ammonia separate product and also reduce their greenhouse emissions the synthesis the basic developed also called the meiser urea process after its the various commercial urea processes are characterized the conditions under which urea formation takes place and the way which unconverted reactants are further the process consists two main equilibrium reactions with incomplete conversion the the first carbamate formation the fast exothermic reaction liquid ammonia with gaseous carbon dioxide high temperature and pressure form ammonium carbamate coonh the second urea conversion the slower endothermic decomposition ammonium carbamate into urea and the overall conversion and urea the reaction heat from the first reaction driving the like all chemical these reactions behave according principle and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have unfavourable effect the urea conversion the process conditions therefore the effect the first reaction the high temperature around needed for the second compensated for conducting the process under high pressure bar which favours the first although necessary compress gaseous carbon dioxide this the ammonia available from the ammonia plant liquid which can pumped into the system much more allow the slow urea formation reaction time reach equilibrium large reaction space the synthesis reactor large urea plant tends massive pressure because the urea conversion the product has separated from unchanged ammonium early urea plants this was done letting down the system pressure atmospheric allow the carbamate decompose back ammonia and carbon originally because was not economic recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for the ammonia least would used for the manufacture other for example ammonium nitrate sulfate the carbon dioxide would likely later process schemes were developed allow recycling the unused ammonia and carbon this was accomplished depressurizing the reaction solution stages first bar and then bar and passing each stage through heated carbamate then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia film carbamate and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous the stripping concept there are two main disadvantages the total concept just the first the complexity the flow scheme consequently the amount process equipment the second the amount water recycled the carbamate which has adverse effect the equilibrium the urea conversion reaction and thus the overall efficiency the the stripping developed the early stamicarbon the addressed both also improved heat recovery and reuse the the position the equilibrium the carbamate decomposition depends the product the partial pressures the the total recycle processes carbamate decomposition promoted reducing the overall which reduces the partial pressure both ammonia and carbon but possible achieve similar effect without lowering the overall pressure suppressing the partial pressure just one the instead being fed directly the reactor along with the the total recycle the stripping process the carbon dioxide gas first routed through stripper carbamate decomposer operating under the full system pressure which configured provide maximum liquid flushing out free ammonia and thus reducing its partial pressure over the liquid and carrying directly carbamate condenser also operating full system from which reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly the that allows the pressure stage the total recycle process omitted the stripping concept proved such major advance that competitors such snamprogetti now saipem the former montedison toyo engineering corporation and urea casale all developed their own versions today effectively all new urea plants use the and many total recycle urea plants have been converted stripping radical alternative has been the main thrust technological development response industry demands for ever larger individual directed reconfiguring and reorientating major items the plant reduce their size and the overall height the well meeting ever more challenging environmental performance side reactions fortunate that the urea conversion reaction slow because were not would into reverse the the succeeding stages the process must designed minimize residence least until the temperature has been reduced the point where the reversion reaction very two reactions produce biuret formed when two molecules urea combine with the loss molecule normally this reaction suppressed the synthesis reactor maintaining excess but after the stripper will occur until the temperature biuret undesirable fertilizer urea because toxic crop although what extent depends the nature the crop and the method application the biuret actually welcome urea when used cattle feed isocyanic acid results from the thermal decomposition ammonium with which urea this reaction its worst when the urea solution heated low which happens when the solution concentrated for prilling granulation see the reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours and recombine when these are condensed form urea which contaminates the process corrosion ammonium carbamate solutions are notoriously corrosive towards metallic materials even the more resistant forms stainless especially the hottest parts the plant such the traditionally corrosion has been minimized although not continuously injecting minor amount oxygen into the plant establish and maintain passive oxide layer exposed stainless steel but because the carbon dioxide feed recovered from ammonia synthesis gas contains traces hydrogen which can mingle with the passivation air form explosive mixture allowed accumulate the the mid two duplex stainless steels were introduced jointly developed toyo engineering and sumitomo metals industries and jointly developed stamicarbon and sandvik materials technology which have allowed the amount passivation oxygen drastically reduced and operate without oxygen saipem now uses either zirconium stripper tubes bimetallic tubes comprising titanium body which cheaper but less which metallurgically bonded internal lining these tubes are fabricated ati wah chang leading specialist refractory and metals using its omegabond finishing urea can produced prills granules pellets crystals and solid forms for its main use fertilizer urea mostly marketed solid either prills the advantage prills they can produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established industrial practice long before satisfactory urea granulation process was however account the limited size particles that can produced with the desired degree sphericity and their low crushing and impact the performance prills during bulk handling and use generally although not considered inferior that high quality compound fertilizers containing nitrogen granulated with other components such phosphates have been produced routinely since the beginnings the modern fertilizer but account the low melting point and hygroscopic nature urea took courage apply the same kind technology granulate urea its but the end the three companies began develop fluidized bed granulation the first the field was nederlandse stikstof which later became part hydro agri now yara international yara eventually sold this technology uhde gmbh whose uhde fertilizer technology subsidiary now markets around the same time toyo engineering corporation developed its bed comprising fluidized bed deliberately agitated produce turbulent stamicarbon also undertook development work its own bed granulation using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays introduce the urea but shelved until the when there was for time considerable doubt about the commercial future the hydro process the stamicarbon technology now commercialized and highly more urea casale has introduced bed granulation system with the urea sprayed laterally from the side walls the granulator instead from the bottom that the bed organizes into two cylindrical masses contrarotating parallel longitudinal the raw product stated uniform that screens are surprisingly perhaps considering the product particles are anything but pastillation using rotoform belt pastillator beginning gain ground urea forming process result development work stamicarbon collaboration with sandvik process systems single machine capacity limited but the machines are simple and need little specific power consumption much lower than for and the product very the robustness the product appears make for its very spherical uan solutions the combined solubility ammonium nitrate and urea much higher than that either component alone that possible obtain stable solution known uan with total nitrogen content approaching that solid ammonium nitrate though that urea itself given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding grade solid ammonium uan provides considerably safer alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make ammonium nitrate more attractive than urea fertilizer areas with short growing also more convenient store and handle than solid product and easier apply accurately the land mechanical laboratory preparation ureas the more general sense can accessed the laboratory reaction phosgene with primary secondary amines proceeding through isocyanate intermediate non symmetric ureas can accessed reaction primary secondary amines with also urea produced when phosgene reacts with ammonia historical process urea was first noticed hermann boerhaave the early century from evaporates hilaire rouelle obtained crystals containing urea from human urine evaporating and treating with alcohol successive this method was aided carl wilhelm scheele discovery that urine treated concentrated nitric acid precipitated antoine comte fourcroy and louis nicolas vauquelin discovered that the nitrated crystals were identical substance and invented the term berzelius made further improvements its purification and finally william prout succeeded obtaining and determining the chemical composition the pure the evolved urea was precipitated urea nitrate adding strong nitric acid purify the resulting they were dissolved boiling water with charcoal and after pure crystals urea nitrate reconstitute the urea from the the crystals are dissolved warm and barium carbonate added the water then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added extract the this solution drained off and allowed evaporate resulting pure chemical properties molecular and crystal structure the urea molecule planar the crystal but the geometry around the nitrogens pyramidal the phase energy solid the oxygen center engaged two hydrogen bonds the resulting dense and energetically favourable bond network probably established the cost efficient molecular the structure quite the ribbons forming tunnels with square the carbon urea described hybridized the bonds have significant double bond and the carbonyl oxygen basic compared say formaldehyde urea high aqueous solubility reflects its ability engage extensive hydrogen bonding with virtue its tendency form porous urea has the ability trap many organic these called clathrates the organic guest molecules are held channels formed interpenetrating helices composed hydrogen bonded urea this behaviour can used separate the production aviation fuel and lubricating oils and the separation hydrocarbons the helices are all helices crystal must have the same molecular handedness this determined when the crystal nucleated and can thus forced the resulting crystals have been used separate racemic mixtures reactions urea reacts with alcohols form urethanes urea reacts with malonic esters make barbituric acids uses agriculture more than world industrial production urea destined for use release urea has the highest nitrogen content all solid nitrogenous fertilizers common therefore has the lowest transportation costs per unit nitrogen nutrient the standard nutrient rating npk rating urea many soil bacteria possess the enzyme urease which catalyzes the conversion the urea ammonia ammonium ion and bicarbonate thus urea fertilizers are very rapidly transformed the ammonium form among soil bacteria known carry some oxidizing bacteria such species nitrosomonas are also able assimilate the carbon dioxide released the reaction make biomass via the calvin cycle and harvest energy oxidizing ammonia the other product process termed nitrification nitrite oxidizing especially nitrobacter oxidize nitrite which extremely mobile soils because its negative charge and major cause water pollution from ammonium and nitrate are readily absorbed and are the dominant sources nitrogen for plant urea also used many component solid fertilizer urea highly soluble water and therefore also very suitable for use fertilizer solutions combination with ammonium nitrate uan foliar fertilizers for fertilizer granules are preferred over prills because their narrower particle size which advantage for mechanical the most common impurity synthetic urea biuret which impairs plant urea usually spread rates between and but rates smaller applications incur lower losses due during urea often spread just before during rain minimize losses from volatilization process wherein nitrogen lost the atmosphere ammonia urea not compatible with other because the high nitrogen concentration very important achieve even the application equipment must correctly calibrated and properly drilling must not occur contact with close due the risk germination urea dissolves water for application spray through irrigation grain and cotton urea often applied the time the last cultivation before high rainfall areas and sandy soils where nitrogen can lost through and where good season rainfall urea can dressed during the growing top dressing also popular pasture and forage cultivating urea dressed after and applied each ratoon crop irrigated urea can applied dry the dissolved and applied through the irrigation urea will dissolve its own weight but becomes increasingly difficult dissolve the concentration dissolving urea water causing the temperature the solution fall when urea practical when preparing urea solutions for fertigation injection into irrigation dissolve more than urea per foliar urea
