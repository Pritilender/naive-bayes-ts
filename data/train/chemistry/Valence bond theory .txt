chemistry	valence bond theory valence bond theory navigation search chemistry valence bond theory one two basic along with molecular orbital theory that were developed use the methods quantum mechanics explain chemical bonding focuses how the atomic orbitals the dissociated atoms combine give individual chemical bonds when molecule molecular orbital theory has orbitals that cover the whole contents history theory theory today applications theory see also references history lewis proposed that chemical bond forms the interaction two shared bonding with the representation molecules lewis structures the heitler london theory was formulated which for the first time enabled the calculation bonding properties the hydrogen molecule based quantum mechanical specifically walter heitler determined how use schr wave equation show how two hydrogen atom wavefunctions join with minus and exchange form covalent bond then called his associate fritz london and they worked out the details the theory over the course the later linus pauling used the pair bonding ideas lewis together with london theory develop two other key concepts resonance and orbital hybridization according charles coulson author the noted book valence this period marks the start modern valence bond contrasted with older valence bond which are essentially electronic theories valence couched mechanical resonance theory was criticized imperfect soviet chemists during the theory according this theory covalent bond formed between the two atoms the overlap half filled valence atomic orbitals each atom containing one unpaired valence bond structure similar lewis structure but where single lewis structure cannot several valence bond structures are each these structures represents specific lewis this combination valence bond structures the main point resonance theory valence bond theory considers that the overlapping atomic orbitals the participating atoms form chemical bond because the most probable that electrons should the bond valence bond theory views bonds weakly coupled orbitals small valence bond theory typically easier employ ground state molecules the overlapping atomic orbitals can the two types overlapping orbitals are sigma and sigma bonds occur when the orbitals two shared electrons overlap bonds occur when two orbitals overlap when they are for bond between two orbital electrons sigma because two spheres are always terms bond single bonds have one sigma double bonds consist one sigma bond and one and triple bonds contain one sigma bond and two however the atomic orbitals for bonding may often the bonding atomic orbitals have character several possible types the methods get atomic orbital with the proper character for the bonding called hybridization theory today valence bond theory now complements molecular orbital theory which does not adhere the idea that electron pairs are localized between two specific atoms molecule but that they are distributed sets molecular orbitals which can extend over the entire theory can predict magnetic and ionization properties straightforward while valence bond theory gives similar results but more valence bond theory views aromatic properties molecules due spin coupling the orbitals while molecular orbital theory views delocalization the the underlying mathematics are also more limiting treatment relatively small the other theory provides much more accurate picture the reorganization electronic charge that takes place when bonds are broken and formed during the course chemical valence bond theory correctly predicts the dissociation homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate while simple molecular orbital theory predicts dissociation into mixture atoms and more several groups have developed what often called modern valence bond theory this replaces the overlapping atomic orbitals overlapping valence bond orbitals that are expanded over large number basis functions either centered each one atom give classical valence bond centered all atoms the the resulting energies are more with energies from calculations where electron correlation introduced based hartree fock reference the most recent text shaik and applications theory important aspect the theory the condition maximum overlap which leads the formation the strongest possible this theory used explain the covalent bond formation many for the case the molecule the bond formed the overlap orbitals the two each containing unpaired since the nature the overlapping orbitals are different and molecules the bond strength and bond lengths differ between and molecules molecule the covalent bond formed the overlap the orbital and the orbital each containing unpaired mutual sharing electrons between and results covalent bond see also modern valence bond theory
