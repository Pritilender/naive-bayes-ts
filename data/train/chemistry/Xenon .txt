england the scottish chemist william ramsay and english chemist morris travers july shortly after their discovery the elements krypton and neon they found xenon the residue left over from evaporating components liquid air ramsay suggested the name xenon for this gas from the greek word neuter singular form meaning ramsay estimated the proportion xenon the atmosphere one part million the current symbol for xenon however historically was also written citation needed during the american engineer harold edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography this led him the invention the xenon flash lamp which light generated sending brief electrical current through tube filled with xenon edgerton was able generate flashes brief one microsecond with this american physician albert behnke began exploring the causes drunkenness sea tested the effects varying the breathing mixtures his and discovered that this caused the divers perceive change from his deduced that xenon gas could serve anesthetic although russian toxicologist nikolay lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was american medical researcher john lawrence who experimented xenon was first used surgical anesthetic american anesthesiologist stuart cullen who successfully operated two xenon and the other noble gases were for long time considered completely chemically inert and not able form compounds however while teaching the university british columbia neil bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride ptf was powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate ptf since and xenon have almost the same first ionization potential bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also able oxidize march mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound noble xenon hexafluoroplatinate bartlett thought its composition ptf although later work has revealed that was probably mixture various containing since many other xenon compounds have been along with some compounds the noble gases argon krypton and radon including argon fluorohydride krypton difluoride krf and radon fluoride more than xenon compounds were characteristics xenon flash animated version xenon has atomic number that its nucleus contains protons standard temperature and pressure pure xenon gas has density about times the surface density the xenon has density with the density maximum occurring the triple under the same the density solid higher than the average density granite using gigapascals pressure xenon has been forced into metallic solid xenon changes from face centered cubic hexagonal close packed crystal phase under pressure and begins turn metallic about with noticeable volume change the hcp completely metallic when xenon looks sky blue because absorbs red light and transmits other visible such behavior unusual for metal and explained the relatively small widths the electron bands metallic xenon member the valence elements that are called noble inert gases inert most common chemical reactions such for because the outer valence shell contains eight this produces minimum energy configuration which the outer electrons are tightly however xenon can oxidized powerful oxidizing and many xenon compounds have been gas filled tube xenon emits blue lavenderish glow when the gas excited electrical discharge xenon emits band emission lines that span the visual but the most intense lines occur the region blue which produces the occurrence and production xenon trace gas earth atmosphere occurring parts per billion approximately part per million and also found gases emitted from some mineral springs xenon obtained commercially byproduct the separation air into oxygen and nitrogen after this generally performed fractional distillation column the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities krypton and additional fractional distillation the liquid oxygen may enriched contain xenon which extracted either via adsorption onto silica gel finally the xenon mixture may separated into krypton and xenon via extraction liter xenon from the atmosphere requires watt hours worldwide production xenon was estimated because its low xenon much more expensive than the lighter noble approximate prices for the purchase small quantities europe were for for and for the much more plentiful argon costs less than cent per within the solar the nucleon fraction xenon for abundance approximately one part thousand the total xenon relatively rare the sun earth and asteroids and comets the planet jupiter has unusually high abundance xenon its about times much the this high abundance remains unexplained and may have been caused early and rapid buildup planetesimals subplanetary before the presolar disk began heat xenon would not have been trapped the planetesimal the problem the low terrestrial xenon may potentially explained covalent bonding xenon oxygen within quartz hence reducing the outgassing xenon into the unlike the lower mass noble the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside star does not form elements more massive than iron have net energy cost produce through there energy gain for star when creating instead xenon formed during supernova explosions the slow neutron capture process process red giant stars that have exhausted the hydrogen their cores and entered the asymptotic giant branch classical nova explosions and from the radioactive decay elements such iodine uranium and plutonium isotopes and isotopic studies isotopes xenon naturally occurring xenon made eight stable isotopes the most any element with the exception tin which has xenon and tin are the only elements have more than seven stable the isotopes and are predicted undergo double beta decay but this has never been observed they are considered besides these stable there are over unstable isotopes that have been the longest lived these isotopes which has been observed undergo double beta decay with life produced beta decay which has half life million while and are some the fission products both and and therefore used indicators nuclear nuclei two the stable isotopes xenon and have zero intrinsic angular momenta nuclear spins suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance the nuclear spins can aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels means circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor the resulting spin polarization xenon nuclei can surpass its maximum possible greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated paramagnetic statistics typically the maximum value room temperature even the strongest magnets such equilibrium alignment spins temporary and called hyperpolarization the process hyperpolarizing the xenon called optical pumping although the process different from pumping laser because nucleus has spin and therefore zero electric quadrupole moment the nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other and thus its hyperpolarization can maintained for long periods time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alkali vapor removed condensation temperature spin polarization can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved blood several hours the gas phase and several days deeply frozen solid has nuclear spin value and nonzero quadrupole moment and has relaxation times the millisecond and second ranges some radioactive isotopes for and are produced neutron irradiation fissionable material within nuclear reactors considerable significance the operation nuclear fission reactors has huge cross section for thermal neutrons barns acts neutron absorber poison that can slow stop the chain reaction after period this was discovered the earliest nuclear reactors built the american manhattan project for plutonium production fortunately the designers had made provisions the design increase the reactivity the number neutrons per fission that fission other atoms nuclear fuel reactor poisoning played major role the chernobyl disaster shutdown decrease power reactor can result buildup and getting the reactor into the iodine pit under adverse relatively high concentrations radioactive xenon isotopes may found emanating from nuclear reactors due the release fission products from cracked fuel rods fissioning uranium cooling water because xenon tracer for two parent xenon isotope ratios meteorites are powerful tool for studying the formation the solar system the iodine xenon method dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation solid object from the solar nebula physicist john reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained isotopic anomaly the form overabundance inferred that this was decay product radioactive iodine this isotope produced slowly cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission but produced quantity only supernova the life comparatively short cosmological time only million this demonstrated that only short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the these two events supernova and solidification gas were inferred have happened during the early history the solar system the isotope was likely generated before the solar system was but not long and seeded the solar gas cloud with isotopes from second this supernova source may also have caused collapse the solar gas similar xenon isotopic ratios such and are also powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early for the atmosphere mars shows xenon abundance similar that parts per however mars shows higher proportion than the earth the this isotope generated radioactive the result may indicate that mars lost most its primordial possibly within the first million years after the planet was another excess found carbon dioxide well gases from new mexico was believed from the decay mantle derived gases soon after compounds category xenon compounds after neil discovery that xenon can form chemical large number xenon compounds have been discovered and almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine halides xenon tetrafluoride three fluorides are xef xef and xef xef theorized the fluorides are the starting point for the synthesis almost all xenon the crystalline difluoride xef formed when mixture fluorine and xenon gases exposed ultraviolet ordinary daylight long term heating xef high temperatures under nif catalyst yields xef pyrolysis xef the presence naf yields purity xef the xenon fluorides behave both fluoride acceptors and fluoride forming salts that contain such cations xef and and anions such xef xef and xef the paramagnetic formed the reduction xef xenon xef also able form coordination complexes with transition metal over such complexes have been synthesized and whereas the xenon fluorides are the other halides are not the only exception being the xecl xenon dichloride reported colorless crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements formed the frequency irradiation mixture fluorine and silicon carbon tetrachloride however doubt has been raised whether xecl real compound and not merely van der waals molecule consisting weakly bound atoms and molecules theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule xecl less stable than the van der waals oxides and oxohalides three oxides xenon are xenon trioxide xeo and xenon tetroxide xeo both which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing and xenon dioxide xeo which was reported with coordination number xeo forms when xenon tetrafluoride poured over its crystal structure may allow replace silicon silicate the xeoo cation has been identified infrared spectroscopy solid argon xenon does not react with oxygen the trioxide formed the hydrolysis xef xef xeo xeo weakly dissolving alkali form unstable xenate salts containing the hxeo anion these unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and perxenate salts containing the xeo anion barium when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid yields gaseous xenon xeo baso xeo prevent the xenon tetroxide thus formed quickly cooled form yellow explodes above into xenon and oxygen number xenon oxyfluorides are including xeof xeof xeo and xeo xeof formed the reaction with xenon gas low may also obtained the partial hydrolysis xef disproportionates into xef and xeo xeof formed the partial hydrolysis xef the reaction xef with sodium xeo the latter reaction also produces small amount xeo xeof reacts with csf form the xeof anion while xeof reacts with the alkali metal fluorides rbf and csf form the xeof anion other compounds recently there has been interest xenon compounds where xenon directly bonded less electronegative element than fluorine particularly carbon electron withdrawing such groups with fluorine are necessary stabilize these numerous such compounds have been including where the pentafluorophenyl where where tert butyl xef other compounds containing xenon bonded less electronegative element include and the latter synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate unusual ion containing xenon the tetraxenonogold cation auxe which contains this ion occurs the compound auxe and remarkable having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive xenon and gold with xenon acting transition metal the compound contains the longest element bond known nen and scientists the university helsinki finland announced the preparation xenon dihydride and later xenon hydroxide hydroxenoacetylene and other containing khriachtchev reported the preparation hxeoxeh the photolysis water within cryogenic xenon deuterated molecules hxeod and have also been clathrates and excimers addition compounds where xenon forms chemical bond xenon can form clathrates substances where xenon atoms are trapped the crystalline lattice another example xenon hydrate where xenon atoms occupy vacancies lattice water this clathrate has melting point the deuterated version this hydrate has also been such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions high such lake vostok underneath the antarctic ice clathrate formation can used fractionally distill argon and xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where xenon atom trapped inside fullerene molecule the xenon atom trapped the fullerene can monitored via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using this chemical reactions the fullerene molecule can due the sensitivity the chemical shift the xenon atom its however the xenon atom also has electronic influence the reactivity the while xenon atoms are their ground energy state they repel each other and will not form when xenon atoms becomes however they can form excimer excited until the electrons return the ground state this entity formed because the xenon atom tends fill its outermost electronic shell and can briefly this adding electron from neighboring xenon the typical lifetime xenon excimer and the decay releases photons with wavelengths about and xenon can also form excimers with other such the halogens bromine chlorine and fluorine applications although xenon rare and relatively expensive extract from earth atmosphere has number illumination and optics gas discharge lamps xenon used emitting devices called xenon flash which are used photographic flashes and stroboscopic excite the active medium lasers which then generate coherent light and occasionally bactericidal lamps the first state laser invented was pumped xenon flash and lasers used power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped xenon flash continuous short high pressure xenon arc lamps have color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used solar simulators that the chromaticity these lamps closely approximates heated black body radiator that has temperature close that observed from the after they were first introduced during the these lamps began replacing the lived carbon arc lamps movie they are employed typical imax and the new digital projectors film projection systems automotive hid headlights high end tactical flashlights and other specialized these arc lamps are excellent source short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and they have intense emissions the near infrared which used some night vision systems the individual cells plasma display use mixture xenon and neon that converted into plasma using electrodes the interaction this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons which then excite the phosphor coating the front the xenon used starter high pressure sodium lamps has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential all the radioactive noble noble does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring the operating the low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses the lamp while the operating and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage the gas relatively low the cold which allows the lamp more easily lasers group researchers bell laboratories discovered laser action and later found that the laser gain was improved adding helium the lasing the first excimer laser used xenon dimer energized beam electrons produce stimulated emission ultraviolet wavelength xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used excimer more exciplex lasers the xenon chloride excimer laser has been for certain dermatological medical anesthesia xenon has been used general anesthetic although anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about appear the european because advances recovery and recycling xenon have made economically xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels and like many theoretically modal inhalation anesthetics these interactions are likely xenon affinity site nmda receptor antagonist however xenon distinguishes itself from other clinically used nmda receptor antagonists its lack neurotoxicity and its ability inhibit the neurotoxicity ketamine and nitrous oxide unlike ketamine and nitrous xenon does not stimulate dopamine efflux from the nucleus accumbens like nitrous oxide and cyclopropane xenon activates the pore domain potassium channel related channel also implicated anesthetic actions insensitive xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which contribute spinally mediated xenon effective inhibitor plasma membrane atpase xenon inhibits atpase binding hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active xenon competitive inhibitor serotonin while neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive this activity reduces emergent nausea and xenon has minimum alveolar concentration age making more potent than thus can used concentrations with oxygen that have lower risk hypoxia unlike nitrous oxide xenon not greenhouse gas and also viewed environmentally friendly xenon vented into the atmosphere being returned its original environmental impact neuroprotectant xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection through variety mechanisms through its influence katp hif and nmda antagonism xenon neuroprotective when administered during and after ischemic xenon high affinity antagonist the nmda receptor glycine xenon cardioprotective reperfusion conditions inducing pharmacologic ischemic xenon cardioprotective activating epsilon downstream xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning activating atp sensitive potassium xenon allosterically reduces atp mediated channel activation inhibition independently the sulfonylurea subunit increasing katp channel time and xenon upregulates hypoxia inducible factor alpha xenon gas was added ingredient the ventilation mix for newborn baby michael bristol england whose life chances were otherwise very and was leading the authorisation clinical trials for similar the treatment done simultaneously with cooling the body temperature doping inhaling oxygen mixture activates production the transcription factor hif alpha which leads increased production erythropoietin the latter hormone known increase red blood cell production and performance xenon inhalation has been used for this purpose russia since least imaging gamma emission from the radioisotope xenon can used image the lungs and for means single photon emission computed tomography has also been used measure blood flow xenon particularly hyperpolarized useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging the gas can used image empty space such cavities porous sample alveoli hyperpolarization renders much more detectable via magnetic resonance imaging and has been used for studies the lungs and other can for trace the flow gases within the because xenon soluble water and also hydrophobic can used image various soft living xenon with its high nuclear mass useful contrast medium for ray for this purpose supplemented krypton and used concentrations below otherwise would act narcotic nmr spectroscopy because the flexible outer electron the nmr spectrum changes response surrounding and can therefore used probe measure the chemical circumstances around the xenon for instance xenon dissolved xenon dissolved hydrophobic and xenon associated with certain proteins can distinguished hyperpolarized xenon can used surface chemists normally difficult characterize surfaces using because signals from the surface sample will overwhelmed signals from the numerous atomic nuclei the however nuclear spins solid surfaces can selectively transferrering spin polarization them from hyperpolarized xenon this makes the surface signals strong enough and distinguishes them from bulk other nuclear energy applications xenon used bubble chambers probes and other areas where high molecular weight and inert nature product nuclear weapon testing the release radioactive and the detection these isotopes used monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties well confirm nuclear test explosions states such north korea jet propulsion laboratory liquid xenon being used calorimeters for measurements gamma rays well medium for detecting hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles when wimp collides with xenon predicted impart enough energy cause ionization and scintillation liquid xenon useful for this type experiment due its high density which makes dark matter interaction more likely and permits quiet detector due xenon the preferred propellant for ion propulsion spacecraft because its low ionization potential per atomic weight and its ability stored liquid near room temperature under high yet easily converted back into gas feed the the inert nature xenon makes environmentally friendly and less corrosive ion engine than other fuels such mercury caesium xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the was later employed propellant for deep space probe europe smart spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines dawn spacecraft chemically the perxenate compounds are used oxidizing agents analytical chemistry xenon difluoride used etchant for silicon particularly the production microelectromechanical systems the anticancer drug fluorouracil can produced reacting xenon difluoride with uracil xenon also used protein crystallography applied pressures from mpa atm protein xenon atoms bind predominantly hydrophobic cavities often creating isomorphous heavy atom which can used for solving the phase problem precautions many containing xenon compounds are toxic due their strong oxidative properties and explosive due their tendency break down into elemental xenon plus diatomic oxygen which contains much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon xenon gas can safely kept normal sealed glass metal containers standard temperature and pressure however readily dissolves most plastics and and will gradually escape from container sealed with such xenon toxic although does dissolve blood and belongs select group substances that penetrate the blood brain barrier causing mild full surgical anesthesia when inhaled high concentrations with the speed sound xenon gas slower than that air due the slower average speed the heavy xenon atoms compared nitrogen and oxygen hence xenon lowers the resonant frequencies the vocal tract when citation needed this produces characteristic lowered voice effect opposite the timbred voice caused inhalation helium like xenon does not satisfy the need for xenon both simple asphyxiant and anesthetic more powerful than nitrous consequently many universities longer allow the voice stunt general chemistry xenon the gas sulfur hexafluoride which similar xenon molecular weight versus generally used this and asphyxiant without being possible safely breathe heavy gases such xenon sulfur hexafluoride when they are mixture with the oxygen comprising least the xenon concentration along with oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness general
