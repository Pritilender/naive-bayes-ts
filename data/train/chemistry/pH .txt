aqueous solution solutions with less than are said acidic and solutions with greater than are basic alkaline pure water has very close the scale traceable set standard solutions whose established international primary standard values are determined using concentration cell with transference measuring the potential difference between hydrogen electrode and standard electrode such the silver chloride electrode measurement for aqueous solutions can done with glass electrode and meter using indicators measurements are important medicine biology chemistry agriculture forestry food science environmental science oceanography civil engineering chemical engineering nutrition water treatment water purification and many other mathematically the negative logarithm the activity the hydronium ion more often expressed the measure the hydronium ion concentration contents history definition and measurement indicators poh extremes non aqueous solutions applications nature seawater living systems calculations strong acids and bases weak acids and bases general method references external links history the concept was first introduced danish chemist ren peder lauritz rensen the carlsberg laboratory and revised the modern accommodate definitions and measurements terms electrochemical the first the notation had the subscript the lowercase the exact meaning the but according the carlsberg foundation stands for power has also been suggested that the stands for the german potenz meaning power others refer french puissance also meaning power based the fact that the carlsberg laboratory was another suggestion that the stands for the latin terms pondus hydrogenii potentia hydrogenii potential also suggested that rensen used the letters and commonly paired letters simply label the test solution and the reference solution current usage chemistry that stands for decimal cologarithm also the term used for acid dissociation constants definition and measurement defined the decimal logarithm the reciprocal the hydrogen ion activity this definition was adopted because ion selective electrodes which are used measure respond ideally electrode follows the nernst equation which for the hydrogen ion can written where measured the standard electrode the gas constant the temperature kelvin the faraday constant for number electrons transferred follows that electrode potential proportional when defined terms precise measurement presented international standard iso galvanic cell set measure the electromotive force between reference electrode and electrode sensitive the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed the same aqueous the reference electrode may silver chloride electrode calomel electrode the ion selective electrode standard hydrogen electrode firstly the cell filled with solution known hydrogen ion activity and the then the the same cell containing the solution unknown the difference between the two measured emf values proportional this method calibration avoids the need know the standard electrode the proportionality ideally equal the nernstian apply this process glass electrode used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen combined glass electrode has built reference calibrated against buffer solutions known hydrogen ion iupac has proposed the use set buffer solutions known activity two more buffer solutions are used order accommodate the fact that the slope may differ slightly from implement this approach the electrode first immersed standard solution and the reading meter adjusted equal the standard the reading from second standard buffer solution then using the slope control equal the for that further are given the iupac recommendations when more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode calibrated fitting observed values straight line with respect standard buffer commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information the value and correction factor applied for other the scale logarithmic and therefore dimensionless quantity this was the original definition which was superseded favor however possible measure the concentration hydrogen ions the electrode calibrated terms hydrogen ion one way which has been used titrate solution known concentration strong acid with solution known concentration strong alkali the presence relatively high concentration background since the concentrations acid and alkali are easy calculate the concentration hydrogen ions that the measured potential can correlated with the calibration usually carried out using gran plot the calibration yields value for the standard electrode and slope that the nernst equation the form can used derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental measurements the slope usually slightly less than slope factor less than indicates that the electrode not functioning the presence background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient effectively constant during the its value can set one defining the standard state being the solution containing the background thus the effect using this procedure make activity equal the numerical value the glass electrode and other ion selective electrodes should calibrated medium similar the one being for one wishes measure the seawater the electrode should calibrated solution resembling seawater its chemical detailed the difference between and quite has been stated that common practice use the term for both types indicators indicator indicators may used measure making use the fact that their color changes with visual comparison the color test solution with standard color chart provides means measure accurate the nearest whole more precise measurements are possible the color measured using colorimeter spectrophotometer universal indicator consists mixture indicators such that there continuous color change from about universal indicator paper made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal thymol blue methyl red bromothymol blue phenolphthalein poh poh sometimes used measure the concentration hydroxide alkalinity poh values are derived from the concentration hydroxide ions water related the concentration hydrogen ions where the self ionisation constant taking logarithms room temperature poh however this relationship not strictly valid other such measurements soil alkalinity extremes measurement below about mol acid and above about mol alkali requires special procedures when using the glass the nernst law breaks down under those various factors contribute cannot assumed that liquid junction potentials are independent also extreme implies that the solution electrode potentials are affected ionic strength variation high the glass electrode may affected alkaline because the electrode becomes sensitive the concentration cations such and the specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these runoff from mines mine tailings can produce some very low non aqueous solutions hydrogen ion concentrations can measured aqueous values based these measurements belong different scale from aqueous because activities relate different standard states hydrogen ion can defined where the chemical potential the hydrogen its chemical potential the chosen standard the gas constant and the thermodynamic temperature therefore values the different scales cannot compared requiring intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient hydro lyonium ion example acidity function other acidity functions can for the hammett acidity function has been developed connection with superacids the concept unified has been developed the basis the absolute chemical potential the this scale applies gases and even applications water has the pure water about this value varies with when acid dissolved the will less than that pure when base alkali dissolved the will greater than that pure solution strong such hydrochloric acid concentration mol has solution strong such sodium hydroxide concentration mol has thus measured values will lie mostly the range though negative values and values above are entirely since logarithmic difference one unit equivalent tenfold difference hydrogen ion the aqueous solution salt such sodium chloride slightly different from that pure even though the salt neither acidic nor this because the hydrogen and hydroxide activity dependent ionic strength varies with ionic the pure water decreases with increasing for the pure water note however that water that has been exposed air mildly this because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the which then slowly converted into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions essentially creating carbonic acid nature dependent plant pigments that can used indicators occur many including hibiscus red cabbage anthocyanin and red wine the juice citrus fruits acidic mainly because contains citric acid other carboxylic acids occur many living for lactic acid produced muscle activity the state protonation phosphate derivatives such atp the functioning the transport enzyme hemoglobin affected process known the root effect seawater the seawater plays important role the carbon cycle and there evidence ongoing ocean acidification caused carbon dioxide emissions however measurement complicated the chemical properties seawater and several distinct scales exist chemical oceanography part its operational definition the the iupac defines series buffer solutions across range values often denoted with nbs nist designation these solutions have relatively low ionic strength compared that seawater and are not recommended for use characterizing the since the ionic strength differences cause changes electrode potential resolve this alternative series buffers based artificial seawater was this new series resolves the problem ionic strength differences between samples and the and the new scale referred the total scale often denoted the total scale was defined using medium containing sulfate ions these ions experience protonation hso such that the total scale includes the effect both protons free hydrogen and hydrogen sulfate alternative the free scale often denoted omits this consideration and focuses solely principle making simpler representation hydrogen ion only can therefore must estimated using the and the stability constant hso however difficult estimate limiting the utility the otherwise more straightforward free another known the seawater scale often denoted takes account further protonation relationship between hydrogen ions and fluoride ions resulting the following expression for however the advantage considering this additional complexity dependent upon the abundance fluoride the for sulfate ions occur much greater concentrations times than those for most practical the difference between the total and seawater scales very the following three equations summaries the three scales practical the three seawater scales differ their values differences that are much larger than the accuracy measurements typically relation the carbonate system since omits consideration sulfate and fluoride the free scale significantly different from both the total and seawater because the relative unimportance the fluoride the total and seawater scales differ only very living systems gastric acid lysosomes chromaffin cells human skin urine cytosol cerebrospinal fluid blood mitochondrial matrix pancreas the different cellular body fluids and organs usually tightly regulated process called acid base homeostasis the most common disorder base homeostasis acidosis which means acid overload the generally defined falling below alkalosis the opposite with blood being excessively the blood usually slightly basic with value this value often referred physiological biology and plaque can create local acidic environment that can result tooth decay enzymes and other proteins have optimum range and can become inactivated denatured outside this calculations the calculation the solution containing acids bases example chemical speciation that mathematical procedure for calculating the concentrations all chemical species that are present the the complexity the procedure depends the nature the for strong acids and bases calculations are necessary except extreme the solution containing weak acid requires the solution quadratic equation the solution containing weak base may require the solution cubic equation the general case requires the solution set non linear simultaneous equations complicating factor that water itself weak acid and weak dissociates according the equilibrium with dissociation constant defined where stands for the concentration the aquated hydronium ion and represents the concentration the hydroxide ion has value about pure water has about this equilibrium needs taken into account high and when the solute concentration extremely strong acids and bases strong acids and bases are compounds for practical are completely dissociated under normal circumstances this means that the concentration hydrogen ions acidic solution can taken equal the concentration the the then equal minus the logarithm the concentration hydrochloric acid example strong the solution hcl equal log that sodium hydroxide naoh example strong the value solution naoh equal log that from the definition above this means that the equal about for solutions sodium hydroxide higher concentrations the ionization equilibrium must taken into self ionization must also considered when concentrations are extremely consider for solution hydrochloric acid concentration the simple procedure given above would suggest that has this clearly wrong acid solution should have less than treating the system mixture hydrochloric acid and the amphoteric substance results weak acids and bases weak acid the conjugate acid weak base can treated using the same first acid dissociation constant defined electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake generality and its value assumed have been determined this being there are three unknown and determine two additional equations are one way provide them apply the law mass conservation terms the two reagents and stands for analytical concentration some texts one mass balance equation replaced equation charge this satisfactory for simple cases like this but more difficult apply more complicated cases those together with the equation defining there are now three equations three when acid dissolved water the concentration the after some further algebraic manipulation equation the hydrogen ion concentration may solution this quadratic equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence more this procedure illustrated ice table which can also used calculate the when some additional acid alkali has been added the that when for what the solution benzoic acid step step set the quadratic step solve the quadratic for alkaline solutions additional term added the balance equation for since addition hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion and the hydroxide ion concentration constrained the ionization equilibrium equal this case the resulting equation cubic general method some such with polyprotic are amenable spreadsheet with three more reagents when many complexes are formed with general formulae such the following general method can used calculate the for with three each equilibrium characterized and equilibrium next write down the balance equations for each reagent note that there are approximations involved these except that each stability constant defined quotient not much more complicated expressions are required activities are there are non linear simultaneous equations the three and because the equations are and because concentrations may range over many powers the solution these equations not however many computer programs are available which can used perform these for details see chemical computer programs there may more than three the calculation hydrogen ion using this key element the determination equilibrium constants potentiometric
