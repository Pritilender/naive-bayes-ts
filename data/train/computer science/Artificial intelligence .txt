artificial intelligence navigation search artificial intelligence artificial intelligence the intelligence exhibited machines also academic field study major researchers and textbooks define the field the study and design intelligent where intelligent agent system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances john mccarthy who coined the term defines the science and engineering making intelligent research highly technical and and deeply divided into subfields that often fail communicate with each some the division due social and cultural subfields have grown around particular institutions and the work individual research also divided several technical some subfields focus the solution specific problems others focus one several possible approaches the use particular tool towards the accomplishment particular applications the central problems research include reasoning knowledge planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability move and manipulate general intelligence strong still among the long term currently popular approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic there are large number tools used including versions search and mathematical optimization logic methods based probability and economics and many the field which number sciences and professions including computer science psychology linguistics philosophy and neuroscience well other specialized field such artificial psychology the field was founded the claim that central property intelligence the sapience homo sapiens can precisely described that machine can made simulate this raises philosophical issues about the nature the mind and the ethics creating artificial beings endowed with like issues which have

provides motion interface for the xbox and the xbox uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy research does the siri goals the general problem simulating intelligence has been broken down into number specific these consist particular traits capabilities that researchers would like intelligent system the traits described below have received the most deduction reasoning problem solving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles make logical the late and research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain incomplete employing concepts from probability and for difficult most these algorithms can require enormous computational resources most experience combinatorial explosion the amount memory computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond certain the search for more efficient solving algorithms high priority for human beings solve most their problems using intuitive judgements rather than the step step deduction that early research was able has made some progress imitating this kind problem embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance sensorimotor skills higher neural net research attempts simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise this statistical approaches mimic the probabilistic nature the human ability knowledge representation knowledge representation commonsense knowledge knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central many the problems machines are expected solve will require extensive knowledge about the among the things that needs represent objects properties categories and relations between situations events states and causes and knowledge about knowledge what know about what other people and many less well researched representation what ontology the set relations concepts and that the machine knows the most general are called upper ontologies which attempt provide foundation for all other among the most difficult problems knowledge representation default reasoning qualification problem john mccarthy commonsense knowledge commonsense knowledge cyc ontological engineering citation needed commonsense knowledge situated computational intelligence statistical planning hierarchical control system control system automated planning and scheduling intelligent agents must able set goals and achieve they need way visualize the future they must have representation the state the world and able make predictions about how their actions will change and able make choices that maximize the utility value the available classical planning the agent can assume that the only thing acting the world and can certain what the consequences its actions may however the agent not the only must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and must change its plan this becomes requiring the agent reason under multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition many agents achieve given emergent behavior such this used evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence learning machine learning machine learning the study computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and has been central research since the unsupervised learning the ability find patterns stream supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression classification used determine what category something belongs after seeing number examples things from several regression the attempt produce function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change the inputs reinforcement learning the agent rewarded for good responses and punished for bad these can analyzed terms decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis machine learning algorithms and their performance branch theoretical computer science known computational learning theory within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition repertoires novel skills through autonomous exploration and social interaction with human and using guidance mechanisms such active maturation motor and natural language processing parse tree syntactic formal grammar natural language processing natural language processing gives machines the ability read and understand the languages that humans sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition knowledge directly from written such newswire some straightforward applications natural language processing include information retrieval text mining and machine translation common method processing and extracting meaning from natural language through semantic increases processing speeds and the drop the cost data storage makes indexing large volumes abstractions the users input much more perception machine perception computer vision speech recognition machine perception the ability use input from sensors such microphones tactile sensors sonar and others more deduce aspects the computer vision the ability analyze visual few selected subproblems are speech recognition facial recognition and object recognition motion and manipulation robotics the field robotics closely related intelligence required for robots able handle such tasks object manipulation and navigation with problems localization knowing where you finding out where other things mapping learning what around building map the and motion planning figuring out how get path planning going from one point space another which may involve compliant motion where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with long term goals among the term goals the research pertaining artificial intelligence social creativity and general social intelligence affective computing kismet affective computing the study and development systems and devices that can interpret process and simulate human affects interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences psychology and cognitive science while the origins the field may traced far back early philosophical inquiries into emotion the more modern branch computer science originated with rosalind picard paper affective motivation for the research the ability simulate empathy the machine should interpret the emotional state humans and adapt its behaviour giving appropriate response for those emotion and social skills play two roles for intelligent first must able predict the actions understanding their motives and emotional this involves elements game theory decision theory well the ability model human emotions and the perceptual skills detect also effort facilitate human computer interaction intelligent machine might want able display emotions even does not actually experience them order appear sensitive the emotional dynamics human creativity computational creativity field addresses creativity both theoretically from philosophical and psychological and practically via specific implementations systems that generate outputs that can considered systems that identify and assess related areas computational research are artificial intuition and artificial thinking general intelligence artificial general intelligence complete many researchers think that their work will eventually incorporated into machine with general intelligence known strong combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities most all few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness artificial brain may required for such many the problems above may require general intelligence considered for even specific task like machine translation requires that the machine read and write both languages nlp follow the argument reason know what being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the intention social intelligence problem like machine translation considered complete order solve this particular you must solve all the approaches there established unifying theory paradigm that guides researchers disagree about many few the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence studying psychology neurology human biology irrelevant research bird biology aeronautical engineering can intelligent behavior described using elegant principles such logic optimization does necessarily require solving large number completely unrelated can intelligence reproduced using level similar words and does require processing john who coined the term gofai good fashioned artificial also proposed that should more properly referred synthetic intelligence term which has since been adopted some gofai cybernetics and brain simulation cybernetics computational neuroscience the and number researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some them built machines that used electronic networks exhibit rudimentary such grey walter turtles and the johns hopkins beast many these researchers gathered for meetings the teleological society princeton university and the ratio club this approach was largely although elements would revived the symbolic gofai when access digital computers became possible the middle research began explore the possibility that human intelligence could reduced symbol the research was centered three carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and each one developed its own style john haugeland named these approaches good old fashioned gofai during the symbolic approaches had achieved great success simulating level thinking small demonstration approaches based cybernetics neural networks were abandoned pushed into the researchers the and the were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed creating machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal their

cybernetics control theory embodied mind thesis cognitive science neural networks connectionism david rumelhart fuzzy systems evolutionary computation computational intelligence statistical the researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools solve specific these tools are truly scientific the sense that their results are both measurable and and they have been responsible for many recent the shared mathematical language has also permitted high level collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics operations research stuart russell and peter norvig describe this movement nothing less than revolution and the victory the neats critics argue that these techniques are too focused particular problems and have failed address the long term goal general there

rodney brooks subsumption architecture tools the course years has developed large number tools solve the most difficult problems computer science few the most general these methods are discussed search and optimization search algorithm mathematical optimization evolutionary computation many problems can solved theory intelligently searching through many possible reasoning can reduced performing for logical proof can viewed searching for path that leads from premises conclusions where each step the application inference rule planning algorithms search through trees goals and attempting find path target process called means ends analysis robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches configuration space many learning algorithms use search algorithms based optimization simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world the search space the number places quickly grows astronomical numbers the result search that too slow never the for many use heuristics rules that eliminate choices that are unlikely lead the goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with best for the path which the solution heuristics limit the search for solutions into smaller sample very different kind search came prominence the based the mathematical theory optimization for many possible begin the search with some form guess and then refine the guess incrementally until more refinements can these algorithms can visualized blind hill climbing begin the search random point the and jumps keep moving our guess until reach the other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization evolutionary computation uses form optimization for they may begin with population organisms the and then allow them mutate and selecting only the fittest survive each generation refining the forms evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms such ant colony particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms such genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming logic logic programming automated reasoning logic used for knowledge representation and problem but can applied other problems for the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming method for learning several different forms logic are used propositional sentential logic the logic statements which can true first order logic also allows the use quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about their and their relations with each fuzzy logic version order logic which allows the truth statement represented value between and rather than simply true false fuzzy systems can used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used modern industrial and consumer product control systems subjective logic models uncertainty different and more explicit manner than given binomial opinion satisfies belief disbelief uncertainty within beta distribution this ignorance can distinguished from probabilistic statements that agent makes with high default logics non monotonic logics and circumscription are forms logic designed help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions logic have been designed handle specific domains knowledge such description logics situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and causal calculus belief and modal logics probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning bayesian network hidden markov model kalman filter decision theory utility theory many problems planning learning perception and require the agent operate with incomplete uncertain researchers have devised number powerful tools solve these problems using methods from probability theory and bayesian networks are very general tool that can used for large number reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectation maximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also used for prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time hidden markov models kalman filters key concept from the science economics utility measure how valuable something intelligent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how agent can make choices and using decision theory decision analysis information value theory these tools include models such markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design classifiers and statistical learning methods classifier statistical classification machine learning the simplest applications can divided into two classifiers shiny then and controllers shiny then pick controllers however also classify conditions before inferring and therefore classification forms central part many classifiers are functions that use pattern matching determine closest they can tuned according making them very attractive for use these examples are known observations supervised each pattern belongs certain predefined class can seen decision that has all the observations combined with their class labels are known data when new observation that observation classified based previous classifier can trained various there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the most widely used classifiers are the neural network kernel methods such the support vector machine nearest neighbor algorithm gaussian mixture model naive bayes classifier and decision tree the performance these classifiers have been compared over wide range classifier performance depends greatly the characteristics the data there single classifier that works best all given this also referred the free lunch theorem determining suitable classifier for given problem still more art than neural networks neural network connectionism neurons human brain the study artificial neural networks began the decade before the field research was the work walter pitts and warren mccullough other important early researchers were frank rosenblatt who invented the perceptron and paul werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm the main categories networks are acyclic feedforward neural networks where the signal passes only one and recurrent neural networks which allow among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks among recurrent the most famous the hopfield net form attractor which was first described john hopfield neural networks can applied the problem intelligent control for learning using such techniques hebbian learning and competitive learning

science fiction writer vernor vinge named the singularity robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than this called transhumanism which has roots aldous huxley and robert ettinger has been illustrated fiction for example the manga ghost the
