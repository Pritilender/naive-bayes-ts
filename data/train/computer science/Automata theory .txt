computational problems that can solved using theory theoretical computer science under discrete mathematics section mathematics and also computer science automata comes from the greek word meaning automata theory the study operating virtual machines help logical understanding input and output without with intermediate computation any function process the figure right illustrates finite state machine which belongs one known variety this automaton consists states represented the figure and transitions represented the automaton sees symbol makes transition jump another according its transition function which takes the current state and the recent symbol its automata theory also closely related formal language theory automaton finite representation formal language that may infinite automata are often classified the class formal languages they are able automata play major role theory computation compiler design artificial intelligence parsing and formal verification contents automata informal description formal definition variant definitions automata classes automata discrete continuous and hybrid automata hierarchy terms powers applications automata simulators connection category theory references further reading external links automata following introductory definition one type which attempts help one grasp the essential concepts involved automata informal description automaton supposed run some given sequence inputs discrete time automaton gets one input every time step that picked from set symbols letters which called alphabet any the symbols far fed the automaton input form finite sequence which called word automaton contains finite set states each instance time some the automaton one its each time step when the automaton reads jumps transitions another state that decided function that takes the current state and symbol this function called the transition function the automaton reads the symbols the input word one after another and transitions from state state according the transition until the word read once the input word has been the automaton said have stopped and the state which automaton has stopped called the final depending the final said that the automaton either accepts rejects input there subset states the which defined the set accepting states the final state accepting then the automaton accepts the otherwise the word rejected the set all the words accepted automaton called the language recognized the automaton automaton mathematical object that takes word input and decides either accept reject since all computational problems are reducible into the reject question words all problem instances can represented finite length citation needed automata theory plays crucial role computational theory formal definition automaton tuple finite set states finite set symbols called the alphabet the the transition function that the start state that the state the automaton before any input has been where set states called accept states string input word run final state formal language recognizable languages regular languages variant definitions automata automata are defined study useful machines under mathematical the definition automaton open variations according the real world which want model using the people have studied many variations the most standard which described called deterministic finite automaton the following are some popular variations the definition different components finite input automaton that accepts only finite sequence the above introductory definition only encompasses finite infinite input automaton that accepts infinite words words such automata are called automata tree word input the input may tree symbols instead sequence this case after reading each the automaton reads all the successor symbols the input said that the automaton makes one copy itself for each successor and each such copy starts running one the successor symbol from the state according the transition relation the such automaton called tree automaton infinite tree input the two extensions above can the automaton reads tree structure with finite such automaton called infinite tree automaton finite states automaton that contains only finite number the above introductory definition describes automata with finite numbers infinite states automaton that may not have finite number even countable number for the quantum finite automaton topological automaton has uncountable infinity stack memory automaton may also contain some extra memory the form stack which symbols can pushed and this kind automaton called pushdown automaton deterministic for given current state and input automaton can only jump one and only one state then deterministic automaton nondeterministic automaton after reading input may jump into any number licensed its transition notice that the term transition function replaced transition the automaton non deterministically decides jump into one the allowed such automata are called nondeterministic automata alternation this idea quite similar tree but the automaton may run its multiple copies the same next read such automata are called alternating automata acceptance condition must satisfy all runs such copies accept the acceptance finite words same described the informal definition acceptance infinite words omega automaton cannot have final infinite words never rather acceptance the word decided looking the infinite sequence visited states during the probabilistic acceptance automaton need not strictly accept reject may accept the input with some probability between zero and for quantum finite geometric automaton and metric automaton have probabilistic different combinations the above variations produce many classes automata theory subject matter that studies properties various types for the following questions are studied about given type which class formal languages recognizable some type recognizable are certain automata closed under intersection complementation formal closure how much type automata expressive terms recognizing class formal and their relative expressive language automata theory also studies there exist any effective algorithm not solve problems similar the following does automaton accept any input emptiness possible transform given deterministic automaton into deterministic automaton without changing the recognizable for given formal what the smallest automaton that recognizes minimization classes automata the following incomplete list types automata nondeterministic

theory plays important roles several applied finite automata are used text compilers and hardware context free grammar are used programming languages and artificial originally cfgs were used the study the human cellular automata are used the field the most common example being john conway game life some other examples which could explained using automata theory biology include mollusk and pine cones growth and pigmentation going theory suggesting that the whole universe computed some sort discrete advocated some the idea originated the work konrad zuse and was popularized america edward fredkin automata simulators automata simulators are pedagogical tools used learn and research automata automata simulator takes input the description automaton and then simulates its working for arbitrary input the description the automaton can entered several automaton can defined symbolic language its specification may entered predesigned form its transition diagram may drawn clicking and dragging the well known automata simulators include jflap vas tags and connection category theory one can define several distinct categories automata following the automata classification into different types described the previous the mathematical category deterministic sequential machines sequential automata and turing machines with automata homomorphisms defining the arrows between automata cartesian closed category has both categorical limits and automata homomorphism maps quintuple automaton onto the quintuple another automaton automata homomorphisms can also considered automata transformations semigroup when the state the automaton defined semigroup monoids are also considered suitable setting for automata monoidal categories one could also define variable automaton the sense norbert wiener his book human use human via the endomorphisms then one can show that such variable automata homomorphisms form mathematical the case other complex kinds the latter set endomorphisms may however variable automaton groupoid therefore the most general categories variable automata any kind are categories groupoids groupoid categories moreover the category reversible automata then category and also subcategory the category the groupoid
