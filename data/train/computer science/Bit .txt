application floating point precision floating point decimal precision bit the basic unit information computing and digital communications bit can have only one two values and may therefore physically implemented with state these values are most commonly represented and the term bit portmanteau binary digit the two values can also interpreted logical values yes algebraic signs activation states any other valued the correspondence between these values and the physical states the underlying storage device matter and different assignments may used even within the same device program the length binary number may referred its bit length information theory one bit typically defined the uncertainty binary random variable that with equal the information that gained when the value such variable becomes quantum computing quantum bit qubit quantum system that can exist superposition two bit true and false the symbol for unit either simply bit recommended the iso iec standard lowercase recommended the ieee standard group bits commonly called byte but historically the size the byte not strictly contents history physical representation transmission and processing storage unit and symbol multiple bits information capacity and information compression bit based computing other information units see also references external links history the encoding data discrete symbols was used bacon cipher the encoding data discrete bits was used the punched cards invented basile bouchon and jean baptiste falcon developed joseph marie jacquard and later adopted semen korsakov charles babbage hermann hollerith and early computer manufacturers like ibm another variant that idea was the perforated paper tape all those the medium card conceptually carried array hole each position could either punched through thus carrying bit the encoding text bits was also used morse code and early digital communications machines such teletypes and stock ticker machines ralph hartley suggested the use logarithmic measure information claude shannon first used the word bit his seminal paper mathematical theory communication attributed its origin john tukey who had written bell labs memo january which contracted binary simply bit interestingly vannevar bush had written bits that could stored the punched cards used the mechanical computers that the first programmable computer built konrad zuse used binary notation for physical representation bit can stored digital device other physical system that exists either two possible distinct states these may the two stable states flip flop two positions electrical switch two distinct voltage current levels allowed circuit two distinct levels light intensity two directions magnetization polarization the orientation reversible double stranded dna etc bits can implemented many most modern computing bit usually represented electrical voltage current pulse the electrical state flip flop circuit for devices using positive logic digit value logical value represented more positive voltage relative the representation the specific voltages are different for different logic families and variations are permitted allow for component aging and noise for transistor transistor logic and compatible digit values and the output device are represented higher than volts and lower than volts respectively while ttl inputs are specified recognize volts below and volts above transmission and processing bits are transmitted one time serial transmission and multiple numbers bits parallel transmission bitwise operation optionally process bits one data transfer rates are usually measured decimal multiples the unit bit per second such storage the earliest electronic information processing such loom analytical engine bit was often stored the position mechanical lever the presence absence hole specific point paper card tape the first electrical devices for discrete logic such elevator and traffic light control telephone switches and konrad represented bits the states electrical relays which could either open closed when relays were replaced vacuum tubes starting the computer builders experimented with variety storage such pressure pulses traveling down mercury delay line charges stored the inside surface cathode ray tube opaque spots printed glass discs photolithographic techniques the and these methods were largely supplanted magnetic storage devices such magnetic core memory magnetic tapes drums and disks where bit was represented the polarity magnetization certain area ferromagnetic film change polarity from one direction the the same principle was later used the magnetic bubble memory developed the and still found various magnetic strip items such metro tickets and some credit cards modern semiconductor memory such dynamic random access memory flash memory the two values bit may represented two levels electric charge stored capacitor programmable logic arrays and certain types read only memory bit may represented the presence absence conducting path certain point optical discs bit encoded the presence absence microscopic pit reflective dimensional bar codes bits are encoded the thickness alternating black and white unit and symbol the bit not defined the international system units however the international electrotechnical commission issued standard iec which specifies that the symbol for binary digit should bit and this should used all such kbit for however the case letter widely used well and was recommended the ieee standard the upper case letter the standard and customary symbol for metric kilobit megabit gigabit terabit petabit exabit zettabit yottabit binary jedec iec kibibit mebibit gibibit tebibit pebibit exbibit zebibit yobibit nibble byte bit and byte prefixes orders magnitude data multiple bits multiple bits may expressed and represented several for convenience representing commonly reoccurring groups bits information several units information have traditionally been the most common the unit byte coined werner buchholz july which historically was used represent the number bits used encode single character text until utf multibyte encoding took computer and for this reason was used the basic addressable element many computer architectures the trend hardware design converged the most common implementation using bits per widely used however because the ambiguity relying the underlying hardware the unit octet was defined explicitly denote sequence computers usually manipulate bits groups fixed conventionally named words like the the number bits word also varies with the hardware and typically between and even more some specialized the retail personal server computers have word size the international system units defines series decimal prefixes for multiples standardized units which are commonly also used with the bit and the the prefixes kilo through yotta increment multiples and the corresponding units are the kilobit through the yottabit information capacity and information compression when the information capacity storage system communication channel presented bits bits per this often refers binary which computer hardware capacity store binary code current etc information capacity storage system only upper bound the actual quantity information stored the two possible values bit storage are not equally that bit storage will contain less than bit indeed the value completely then the reading that value will provide information all zero entropic because resolution uncertainty and therefore computer file that uses bits storage contains only bits then that information can principle encoded about least the this principle the basis data compression technology using the hardware binary digits refer the amount storage space available like the number buckets available store and the information content the which comes different levels granularity fine that compressed uncompressed when the granularity finer when information more the same bucket can hold for estimated that the combined technological capacity the world store information provides exabytes hardware digits however when this storage space filled and the corresponding content optimally this only represents exabytes when optimally the resulting carrying capacity approaches shannon information information entropy bit based computing certain bitwise computer processor instructions such bit set operate the level manipulating bits rather than manipulating data interpreted aggregate the when bitmapped computer displays became some computers provided specialized bit block transfer bitblt blit instructions set copy the bits that corresponded given rectangular area the most computers and programming when bit within group such byte referred usually specified number from upwards corresponding its position within the byte however can refer either the most least significant bit depending the other information units units information other units sometimes used information include the natural digit also called nat nit and defined log where the base the natural logarithms and the dit ban hartley defined log conversely one bit information corresponds about nats log hartleys some authors also define binit arbitrary information unit equivalent some fixed but unspecified number see also integer computer
