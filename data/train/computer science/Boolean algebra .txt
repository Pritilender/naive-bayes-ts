boolean algebra digital logic navigation search boolean algebra boolean ring mathematics and mathematical logic boolean algebra the subarea algebra which the values the variables are the truth values true and false usually denoted and respectively instead elementary algebra where the values the variables are and the main operations are addition and the main operations boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted the disjunction denoted and the negation not denoted boolean algebra was introduced george boole his book investigation the laws thought according huntington the term boolean was first suggested sheffer boole first book the mathematical analysis logic published included the original this was proposed mathematical language dealing with the questions logic which now needed the design modern digital and now exists core data type all modern programming languages generally abbreviated type representing true false within assertion boolean algebra has been fundamental the development digital electronics also used set theory and statistics contents history values operations basic operations derived operations laws monotone laws nonmonotone laws completeness duality

representable boolean algebras axiomatizing boolean algebra propositional logic applications deductive systems for propositional logic sequent calculus applications two valued logic boolean operations boolean searches see also references further reading external links history boole algebra predated the modern developments abstract algebra and mathematical however seen connected the origins both abstract boolean algebra was perfected the late century jevons schr der huntington and others until reached the modern conception mathematical structure for the empirical observation that one can manipulate expressions the algebra sets translating them into expressions algebra explained modern terms saying that the algebra sets boolean algebra note the indefinite article stone proved that every boolean algebra isomorphic field sets the while studying switching circuits claude shannon observed that one could also apply the rules algebra this and introduced switching algebra way analyze and design circuits algebraic means terms logic gates shannon already had his disposal the abstract mathematical thus cast his switching algebra the two element boolean algebra circuit engineering settings there little need consider other boolean thus switching and boolean are often used efficient implementation boolean functions fundamental problem the design combinatorial logic circuits modern electronic design automation tools for vlsi circuits often rely efficient representation boolean functions known reduced binary decision diagrams for logic synthesis and formal verification logic sentences that can expressed classical propositional calculus have equivalent expression boolean thus boolean logic sometimes used denote propositional calculus performed this boolean algebra not sufficient capture logic formulas using quantifiers like those from first order logic although the development mathematical logic did not follow the connection between his algebra and logic was later put firm ground the setting algebraic logic which also studies the algebraic systems many other the problem determining whether the variables given boolean formula can assigned such way make the formula evaluate true called the boolean satisfiability problem and importance theoretical computer science being the first problem shown complete the closely related model computation known boolean circuit relates time complexity algorithm circuit complexity values whereas elementary algebra expressions denote mainly numbers boolean algebra they denote the truth values false and true these values are represented with the bits binary namely and they not behave like the integers and for which but may identified with the elements the two element field for which with serving the boolean operation boolean algebra also deals with functions which have their values the set sequence bits commonly used such another common example the subsets set subset associated the indicator function that takes the value and outside with elementary the purely equational part the theory may developed without considering explicit values for the operations basic operations the basic operations boolean algebra are and conjunction denoted sometimes and satisfies and otherwise disjunction denoted sometimes satisfies and otherwise not negation denoted sometimes not satisfies and the truth values and are interpreted these operation may expressed with the ordinary operations the alternatively the values and can expressed tabulating their values with truth tables one may consider that only the negation and one the two other operations are because the following identities that allow define the conjunction terms the negation and the and vice derived operations have far seen three boolean referred these meaning that they can taken basis for other boolean operations that can built from them composition the manner which operations are combined here are some examples operations composed from the basic these definitions give rise the following truth tables giving the values these operations for all four possible the first called material implication true then the value taken that but false then ignore the value however must return some truth value and there are only two choose the value that entails namely true relevance logic addresses this viewing implication with false premise something other than either true the second called exclusive distinguish from disjunction the inclusive excludes the possibility both and defined terms arithmetic addition where the third the complement exclusive equivalence boolean true just when and have the same hence its complement can understood being true just when and are its counterpart arithmetic mod given two each with two possible have possible combinations because each output can have two possible have total possible binary boolean operations laws law boolean algebra identity such between two boolean where boolean term defined expression built from variables and the constants and using the operations and the concept can extended terms involving other boolean operations such and but such extensions are unnecessary for the purposes which the laws are such purposes include the definition boolean algebra any model the boolean and means for deriving new laws from old the derivation from treated the section axiomatization monotone laws boolean algebra satisfies many the same laws ordinary algebra when match with addition and with particular the following laws are common both kinds boolean algebra however obeys some additional particular the consequence the first these laws which false ordinary where taking the second law shows that not ordinary algebra law since the remaining four laws can falsified ordinary algebra taking all variables for example absorption law the left hand side while the right hand side and all the laws treated far have been for conjunction and these operations have the property that changing either argument either leaves the output unchanged the output changes the same way the equivalently changing any variable from never results the output changing from operations with this property are said monotone thus the axioms far have all been for monotonic boolean nonmonotonicity enters via complement nonmonotone laws the complement operation defined the following two all properties negation including the laws below follow from the above two laws both ordinary and boolean negation works exchanging pairs whence both algebras satisfies the double negation law also called involution but whereas ordinary algebra satisfies the two laws boolean algebra satisfies laws completeness this point can now claim have defined boolean the sense that the laws have listed now entail the rest the the laws complementation and together with the monotone suffice for this purpose and can therefore taken one possible complete set laws axiomatization boolean every law boolean algebra follows logically from these furthermore boolean algebras can then defined the models these axioms treated the section thereon writing down further laws boolean algebra cannot give rise any new consequences these nor can rule out any model had stopped listing laws too there would have been boolean laws that did not follow from those our and moreover there would have been models the listed laws that were not boolean this axiomatization means the only even necessarily the most natural given that did not pay attention whether some the axioms followed from others but simply chose stop when noticed had enough treated further the section axiomatizations the intermediate notion axiom can sidestepped altogether defining boolean law directly any tautology understood equation that holds for all values its variables over and all these definitions boolean algebra can shown boolean algebra has the interesting property that can proved from any this because the substitution instance any tautology obtained instantiating its variables with constants witness its tautologyhood reduces equational reasoning for example the tautologyhood witnessed and and taking this axiom would allow infer substitution instance the axiom and hence can then show the reasoning duality principle there nothing magical about the choice symbols for the values boolean could rename and say and and long did consistently throughout would still boolean albeit with some obvious cosmetic but suppose rename and and respectively then would still boolean and moreover operating the same however would not identical our original boolean algebra because now find behaving the way used and vice there are still some cosmetic differences show that been fiddling with the despite the fact that still using and but addition interchanging the names the values also interchange the names the two binary now there trace what have the end product completely indistinguishable from what started might notice that the columns for and the truth tables had changed but that switch when values and operations can paired way that leaves everything important unchanged when all pairs are switched call the members each pair dual each thus and are and and are the duality principle also called morgan duality asserts that boolean algebra unchanged when all dual pairs are one change did not need make part this interchange was say that complement self dual operation the identity nothing operation copy the input the also more complicated example dual operation can shown that dual operations must take odd number thus there can dual binary the principle duality can explained from group theory perspective fact that there are exactly four functions that are one mappings automorphisms the set boolean polynomials back the identity the complement the dual function and the contradual function complemented these four functions form group under function composition isomorphic the klein group acting the set boolean diagrammatic representations venn diagrams venn diagram representation boolean operation using shaded overlapping there one region for each all circular the examples the interior and exterior region corresponds respectively the values and for variable the shading indicates the value the operation for each combination with dark denoting and light some authors use the opposite the three venn diagrams the figure below represent respectively conjunction disjunction and complement for the region inside both circles shaded indicate that when both variables are the other regions are left unshaded indicate that for the other three the second diagram represents disjunction shading those regions that lie inside either both the third diagram represents complement shading the region not inside the while have not shown the venn diagrams for the constants and they are being respectively white box and dark neither one containing however could put circle for those which case each would denote function one which returns the same value independently called constant far their outputs are constants and constant functions are the difference that constant takes called zeroary nullary operation while constant function takes one which and unary operation venn diagrams are helpful visualizing the commutativity laws for and can seen from the symmetry the binary operation that was not commutative would not have symmetric diagram because interchanging and would have the effect reflecting the diagram horizontally and any failure commutativity would then appear failure idempotence and can visualized sliding the two circles together and noting that the shaded area then becomes the whole for both and see the first absorption start with the diagram the middle for and note that the portion the shaded area common with the circle the whole the circle for the second absorption start with the left diagram for and note that shading the whole the circle results just the circle being since the previous shading was inside the circle the double negation law can seen complementing the shading the third diagram for which shades the circle visualize the first start with the middle diagram for and complement its shading that only the region outside both circles which what the right hand side the law the result the same shaded that region which both outside the circle and outside the circle the conjunction their which what the left hand side the law the second works the same way with the two diagrams the first complement says that the interior and exterior the circle have the second complement says that everything either inside outside the circle digital logic gates digital logic the application the boolean algebra and electronic hardware consisting logic gates connected form circuit diagram each gate implements boolean and depicted schematically shape indicating the the shapes associated with the gates for conjunction disjunction and complement are the lines the left each gate represent input wires ports the value the input represented voltage the for called logic represented voltage close zero ground while represented voltage close the supply active low reverses the line the right each gate represents the output which normally follows the same voltage conventions the input complement implemented with inverter the triangle denotes the operation that simply copies the input the the small circle the output denotes the actual inversion complementing the the convention putting such circle any port means that the signal passing through this port complemented the way whether input output the duality principle laws can understood asserting that complementing all three ports and gate converts gate and vice shown figure below complementing both ports inverter however leaves the operation more generally one may complement any the eight subsets the three ports either and the resulting sixteen possibilities give rise only eight boolean namely those with odd number their truth there are eight such because the can either and can any four positions the truth there being sixteen binary boolean this must leave eight operations with even number their truth two these are the constants and binary operations that ignore both their four are the operations that depend nontrivially exactly one their two namely and and the remaining two are and its complement boolean algebras boolean algebra the term algebra denotes both namely the subject algebra and namely algebraic structure whereas the foregoing has addressed the subject boolean this section deals with mathematical objects called boolean defined full generality any model the boolean begin with special case the notion definable without reference the namely concrete boolean and then give the formal definition the general concrete boolean algebras concrete boolean algebra field sets any nonempty set subsets given set closed under the set operations union intersection and complement relative historically itself was required nonempty well exclude the degenerate element boolean which the one exception the rule that all boolean algebras satisfy the same equations since the degenerate algebra satisfies every however this exclusion conflicts with the preferred purely equational definition boolean there being way rule out the element algebra using only does not being negated hence modern authors allow the degenerate boolean algebra and let example the power set consisting all subsets here may any empty finite infinite even uncountable example the empty set and this element algebra shows that concrete boolean algebra can finite even when consists subsets infinite can seen that every field subsets must contain the empty set and hence smaller example other than the degenerate algebra obtained taking empty make the empty set and coincide example the set finite and cofinite sets where cofinite set one omitting only finitely many this clearly closed under and closed under union because the union cofinite set with any set while the union two finite sets intersection behaves like union with finite and cofinite interchanged example for less trivial example the point made example consider venn diagram formed closed curves partitioning the diagram into regions and let the set all points the plane not any curve but somewhere within the the interior each region thus infinite subset and every point exactly one then the set all possible unions regions including the empty set obtained the union the empty set regions and obtained the union all regions closed under intersection and complement relative and therefore forms concrete boolean again have finitely many subsets infinite set forming concrete boolean with example arising the case subsets bit vectors subset can identified with indexed family bits with index set with the bit indexed being according whether not this the called characteristic function notion for example bit computer word consists bits indexed the set with and indexing the low and high order bits for smaller where are viewed bit positions that order from left the eight subsets and can identified with the respective bit vectors and bit vectors indexed the set natural numbers are infinite sequences while those indexed the reals the unit interval are packed too densely able write conventionally but nonetheless form defined indexed families imagine coloring every point the interval either black white the black points then form arbitrary subset from this bit vector concrete boolean algebra can defined equivalently nonempty set bit vectors all the same length more indexed the same and closed under the bit vector operations bitwise and and the bit vector realizations union and complement the prototypical boolean algebra two element boolean algebra the set and its boolean operations treated above can understood the special case bit vectors length which the identification bit vectors with subsets can also understood the two subsets element call this the prototypical boolean justified the following this observation easily proved certainly any law satisfied all concrete boolean algebras satisfied the prototypical one since conversely any law that fails for some concrete boolean algebra must have failed particular bit which case that position itself furnishes bit counterexample that nondegeneracy ensures the existence least one bit position because there only one empty bit the final goal the next section can understood eliminating concrete from the above shall however reach that goal via the surprisingly stronger observation all boolean algebras are boolean the definition the boolean algebras have seen far have all been consisting bit vectors equivalently subsets some such boolean algebra consists set and operations that set which can shown satisfy the laws boolean instead showing that the boolean laws are can instead postulate set two binary operations and one unary and require that those operations satisfy the laws boolean the elements need not bit vectors subsets but can anything this leads the more general abstract definition boolean algebra for the purposes this definition irrelevant how the operations came satisfy the whether fiat all concrete boolean algebras satisfy the laws proof rather than whence every concrete boolean algebra boolean algebra according our this axiomatic definition boolean algebra set and certain operations satisfying certain laws axioms fiat entirely analogous the abstract definitions group ring field etc characteristic modern abstract algebra given any complete axiomatization boolean such the axioms for complemented distributive lattice sufficient condition for algebraic structure this kind satisfy all the boolean laws that satisfy just those the following therefore equivalent boolean algebra the section axiomatization lists other any which can made the basis equivalent representable boolean algebras although every concrete boolean algebra boolean not every boolean algebra need let square free positive one not divisible the square for example but not the operations greatest common divisor least common multiple and division into that can shown satisfy all the boolean laws when their arguments range over the positive divisors hence those divisors form boolean these divisors are not subsets making the divisors boolean algebra that not concrete according our however represent each divisor the set its prime find that this nonconcrete boolean algebra isomorphic the concrete boolean algebra consisting all sets prime factors with union corresponding least common intersection greatest common and complement division into this example while not technically concrete least morally concrete via this called isomorphism this example instance the following representable the obvious next question answered positively that abstract and concrete boolean algebras are the same this quite nontrivial result depends the boolean prime ideal theorem choice principle slightly weaker than the axiom choice and treated more detail the article stone representation theorem for boolean algebras this strong relationship implies weaker result strengthening the observation the previous subsection the following easy consequence weaker the sense that does not itself imply boolean algebras are special for example relation algebra boolean algebra with additional structure but not the case that every relation algebra representable the sense appropriate relation axiomatizing boolean algebra axiomatization boolean algebras boolean algebras canonically defined the above definition abstract boolean algebra set and operations satisfying the boolean laws raises the what are those minded answer all boolean which can defined all equations that hold for the boolean algebra and since there are infinitely many such laws this not terribly satisfactory answer leading the next does suffice require only finitely many laws the case boolean algebras the answer particular the finitely many equations have listed above say that boolean algebra finitely axiomatizable finitely can this list made shorter again the answer begin some the above laws are implied some the sufficient subset the above laws consists the pairs commutativity and absorption distributivity over the other distributivity one and the two complement fact this the traditional axiomatization boolean algebra complemented distributive lattice introducing additional laws not listed above becomes possible shorten the list yet edward huntington showed that the basic operations are taken and with considered derived operation via law the form then the equation along with the two equations expressing associativity and commutativity completely axiomatized boolean when the only basic operation the binary nand operation stephen wolfram has proposed his book new kind science the single axiom equation axiomatization boolean where for convenience here denotes the nand rather than the and and propositional logic propositional calculus propositional logic logical system that intimately connected boolean many syntactic concepts boolean algebra carry over propositional logic with only minor changes notation and while the semantics propositional logic are defined via boolean algebras way that the tautologies propositional

variables become propositional variables atoms boolean terms such become propositional formulas becomes false and becomes true convenient when referring generic propositions use greek letters metavariables variables outside the language propositional used when talking about propositional denote the semantics propositional logic rely truth assignment the essential idea truth assignment that the propositional variables are mapped elements fixed boolean and then the truth value propositional formula using these letters the element the boolean algebra that obtained computing the value the boolean term corresponding the classical only the element boolean algebra while boolean valued semantics arbitrary boolean algebras are tautology propositional formula that assigned truth value every truth assignment its propositional variables arbitrary boolean algebra equivalently every truth assignment the two element boolean these semantics permit translation between tautologies propositional logic and equational theorems boolean every tautology propositional logic can expressed the boolean equation which will theorem boolean conversely every theorem boolean algebra corresponds the tautologies and the language these last tautologies can also written two separate theorems and available then the single tautology can applications one motivating application propositional calculus the analysis propositions and deductive arguments natural whereas the proposition then depends the meanings such symbols and the proposition then does true merely virtue its and remains true whether replaced the moon made green the generic abstract form this tautology then the language boolean replacing any other proposition called instantiation that the result instantiating abstract proposition called instance the thus tautology virtue being instance the abstract tautology all occurrences the instantiated variable must instantiated with the same avoid such nonsense propositional calculus restricts attention abstract those built from propositional variables using boolean instantiation still possible within propositional but only instantiating propositional variables abstract such instantiating yield the instance the availability instantiation part the machinery propositional calculus avoids the need for metavariables within the language propositional since ordinary propositional variables can considered within the language denote arbitrary the metavariables themselves are outside the reach not being part the language propositional calculus but rather part the same language for talking about that this sentence written where need able distinguish propositional variables and their instantiations being distinct syntactic deductive systems for propositional logic axiomatization propositional calculus set tautologies called axioms and one more inference rules for producing new tautologies from proof axiom system finite nonempty sequence propositions each which either instance axiom follows some rule from propositions appearing earlier the proof thereby disallowing circular the last proposition the theorem proved the every nonempty initial segment proof itself whence every proposition proof itself axiomatization sound when every theorem and complete when every tautology sequent calculus sequent calculus propositional calculus commonly organized hilbert system whose operations are just those boolean algebra and whose theorems are boolean those boolean terms equal the boolean constant another form sequent calculus which has two propositions ordinary propositional and pairs lists propositions called sequents such the two halves sequent are called the antecedent and the succedent the customary metavariable denoting antecedent part thereof and for succedent thus would denote sequent whose succedent list and whose antecedent list with additional proposition appended after the antecedent interpreted the conjunction its the succedent the disjunction its and the sequent itself the entailment the succedent the entailment differs from implication that whereas the latter binary operation that returns value boolean the former binary relation which either holds does not this sense entailment external form meaning external the boolean thinking the reader the sequent also being external and interpreting and comparing antecedents and succedents some boolean the natural interpretation the partial order the boolean algebra defined just when this ability mix external implication and internal implication the one logic among the essential differences between sequent calculus and propositional applications two valued logic boolean algebra the calculus two values fundamental digital computer and mathematical and also used other

cards paper and now possible code more than two symbols any given for example one might use respectively and volts code symbol alphabet holes different sizes punched practice however the tight constraints high small and low power combine make noise major this makes hard distinguish between symbols when there are many them single rather than attempting distinguish between four voltages one digital designers have settled two voltages per high and obtain four symbols one uses two and programmers programming machine code assembly language and other programming languages that expose the
