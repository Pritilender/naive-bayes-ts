communication through channel storage medium early example the invention language which enabled through speech communicate what she heard felt thought but speech limits the range communication the distance voice can and limits the audience those present when the speech the invention writing which converted spoken language into visual symbols extended the range communication across space and time the process encoding converts information from source into symbols for communication decoding the reverse converting code symbols back into form that the recipient one reason for coding enable communication places where ordinary plain language spoken difficult for semaphore where the configuration flags held signaller the arms semaphore tower encodes parts the typically individual letters and another person standing great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words contents theory variable length codes error correcting codes examples codes communication used for

code usually considered algorithm which uniquely represents symbols from some source alphabet encoded strings which may some other target extension the code for representing sequences symbols over the source alphabet obtained concatenating the encoded before giving mathematically precise give brief the mapping whose source alphabet the set and whose target alphabet the set using the extension the the encoded string can grouped into codewords and these turn can decoded the sequence source symbols acabc using terms from formal language theory the precise mathematical definition this concept let and two finite called the source and target alphabets respectively code total function mapping each symbol from sequence symbols over and the extension homomorphism into which naturally maps each sequence source symbols sequence target referred its extension variable length codes variable length code this section consider which encode each source clear character code word from some and concatenation such code words give encoded variable length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different see also entropy encoding prefix code code with the prefix there valid code word the system that prefix any other valid code word the huffman coding the most known algorithm for deriving prefix prefix codes are widely referred huffman even when the code was not produced huffman other examples prefix codes are country calling codes the country and publisher parts isbns and the secondary synchronization codes used the umts cdma wireless kraft inequality characterizes the sets code word lengths that are possible prefix virtually any uniquely decodable many not necessary prefix must satisfy error correcting codes error detection and correction block code codes may also used represent data way more resistant errors transmission such code called error correcting code and works including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored data examples include hamming codes reed solomon reed muller walsh hadamard bose hochquenghem turbo golay goppa low density check codes and space time codes error detecting codes can optimised detect burst errors random errors examples codes communication used for brevity cable code replaces words ship invoice with shorter allowing the same information sent with fewer characters more and most less codes can used for when telegraph messages were the state the art rapid long distance elaborate systems commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single words commonly letter were that telegraphers became conversant with such words byoxo are you trying weasel out our liouy why you not answer bmuld ayylu not clearly repeat more code words were chosen for various length pronounceability etc meanings were chosen fit perceived commercial military terms for military diplomatic terms for diplomatic any and all the preceding for espionage codebooks and codebook publishers including one run front for the american black chamber run herbert yardley between the first and second world the purpose most these codes was save cable the use data coding for data compression predates the computer early example the telegraph morse code where frequently used characters have shorter techniques such huffman coding are now used based algorithms compress large data files into more compact form for storage bletchley park bletchley park estate located the town milton buckinghamshire england and run the bletchley park trust heritage during the second world bletchley park was the site the united main decryption the government code and cypher school where ciphers and codes several axis countries were most importantly the ciphers generated the german enigma and lorenz the place was known the people who worked for the many members the royal naval service who worked bletchley their posting was hms pembroke character encodings character encoding probably the most widely known data communications code far aka character use today ascii one another somewhat version used nearly all personal computers terminals printers and other communication represents characters with bit binary numbers that string seven and bits ascii lowercase always uppercase always and there are many other which represent each character byte usually referred code pages integer code point unicode byte sequence utf
