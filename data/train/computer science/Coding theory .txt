coding theory the study the properties codes and their fitness for specific codes are used for data compression cryptography error correction and more recently also for network coding codes are studied various scientific such information theory electrical engineering mathematics and computer science for the purpose designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods this typically involves the removal redundancy and the correction errors the transmitted there are essentially two aspects coding data compression source coding error correction channel coding these two aspects may studied combination source encoding attempts compress the data from source order transmit more this practice found every day the internet where the common zip data compression used reduce the network load and make files the channel adds extra data bits make the transmission data more robust disturbances present the transmission the ordinary user may not aware many applications using channel typical music uses the reed solomon code correct for scratches and this application the transmission channel the cell phones also use coding techniques correct for the fading and noise high frequency radio data telephone and nasa all employ channel coding techniques get the bits for example the turbo code and ldpc codes contents history coding theory source coding definition properties principle example channel coding linear codes linear block codes convolutional codes other applications coding theory group testing analog coding neural coding see also notes references history coding theory claude shannon published mathematical theory communication article two parts the july and october issues the bell system technical journal this work focuses the problem how best encode the information sender wants this fundamental work used tools probability developed norbert wiener which were their nascent stages being applied communication theory that shannon developed information entropy measure for the uncertainty message while essentially inventing the field information theory the binary golay code was developed more correcting code capable correcting three errors each bit and detecting hamming distance richard hamming won the turing award for his work bell labs numerical automatic coding and detecting and correcting invented the concepts known hamming codes hamming windows hamming numbers and hamming distance source coding data compression the aim source coding take the source data and make definition data can seen random variable where appears with probability data are encoded strings over alphabet code function the empty string not part the the code word associated with length the code word written expected length code the concatenation code words the code word the empty string the empty string properties non singular injective uniquely decodable instantaneous not prefix and principle entropy source the measure basically source codes try reduce the redundancy present the and represent the source with fewer bits that carry more data compression which explicitly tries minimize the average length messages according particular assumed probability model called entropy encoding various techniques used source coding schemes try achieve the limit entropy the where entropy source and the bitrate after source coding scheme can better than the entropy the example facsimile transmission uses simple run length code source coding removes all data superfluous the need the decreasing the bandwidth required for channel coding forward error correction the purpose channel coding theory find codes which transmit contain many valid code words and can correct least detect many while not mutually performance these areas trade different codes are optimal for different the needed properties this code mainly depend the probability errors happening during typical the impairment mainly dust thus codes are used interleaved citation needed the data spread out over the although not very good simple repeat code can serve understandable suppose take block data bits representing and send three the receiver will examine the three repetitions bit bit and take majority the twist this that merely send the bits interleave the block data bits first divided into smaller then cycle through the block and send one bit from the then the etc this done three times spread the data out over the surface the the context the simple repeat this may not appear however there are more powerful codes known which are very effective correcting the burst error scratch dust spot when this interleaving technique other codes are more appropriate for different deep space communications are limited the thermal noise the receiver which more continuous nature than bursty likewise narrowband modems are limited the present the telephone network and also modeled better continuous citation needed cell phones are subject rapid the high frequencies used can cause rapid fading the signal even the receiver moved few again there are class channel codes that are designed combat citation needed linear codes linear code the term algebraic coding theory denotes the field coding theory where the properties codes are expressed algebraic terms and then further citation needed algebraic coding theory basically divided into two major types citation needed linear block codes convolutional analyzes the following three properties code mainly citation needed code word length total number valid code words the minimum distance between two valid code using mainly the hamming distance sometimes also other distances like the lee distance linear block codes block code linear block codes have the property linearity the sum any two codewords also code and they are applied the source bits hence the name linear block there are block codes that are not but difficult prove that code good one without this linear block codes are summarized their symbol alphabets binary and parameters where the length the the number source symbols that will used for encoding the minimum hamming distance for the there are many types linear block such cyclic codes hamming codes repetition codes parity codes polynomial codes bch codes reed solomon codes algebraic geometric codes muller codes perfect codes block codes are tied the sphere packing problem which has received some attention over the two easy take bunch pennies flat the table and push them the result hexagon pattern like but block codes rely more dimensions which cannot easily the powerful golay code used deep space communications uses dimensions used binary code which usually the dimensions refer the length the codeword defined the theory coding uses the dimensional sphere for how many pennies can packed into circle dimensions how many marbles can packed into other considerations enter the choice for hexagon packing into the constraint rectangular box will leave empty space the the dimensions get the percentage empty space grows but certain the packing uses all the space and these codes are the called perfect codes the only nontrivial and useful perfect codes are the hamming codes with parameters satisfying and the binary and ternary golay another code property the number neighbors that single codeword may again consider pennies first pack the pennies rectangular each penny will have near neighbors and the corners which are farther each penny will have near when increase the the number near neighbors increases very the result the number ways for noise make the receiver choose neighbor hence grows this fundamental limitation block and indeed all may harder cause error single but the number neighbors can large enough the total error probability actually properties linear block codes are used many for the coset uniqueness property linear block codes used trellis one the best known shaping codes this same property used sensor networks for distributed source coding convolutional codes convolutional code the idea behind convolutional code make every codeword symbol the weighted sum the various input message this like convolution used lti systems find the output when you know the input and impulse generally find the output the system convolutional which the convolution the input against the states the convolution registers fundamentally convolutional codes not offer more protection against noise than equivalent block many they generally offer greater simplicity implementation over block code equal the encoder usually simple circuit which has state memory and some feedback normally xor the decoder can implemented software the viterbi algorithm the optimum algorithm used decode convolutional there are simplifications reduce the computational they rely searching only the most likely although not they have generally been found give good results the lower noise convolutional codes are used voiceband modems and gsm mobile well satellite and military communication other applications coding theory this article section may contain parts that are misleading please help clarify this article according any suggestions provided the talk page august another concern coding theory designing codes that help synchronization code may designed that phase shift can easily detected and corrected and that multiple signals can sent the same citation needed another application used some mobile phone code division multiple access each phone assigned code sequence that approximately uncorrelated with the codes other citation needed when the code word used modulate the data bits representing the voice the demodulation process performed recover the the properties this class codes allow many users with different use the same radio channel the same the the signals other users will appear the demodulator only level citation needed another general class codes are the automatic request codes these codes the sender adds redundancy each message for error usually adding check the check bits are not consistent with the rest the message when the receiver will ask the sender retransmit the all but the simplest wide area network protocols use common protocols include sdlc tcp and many there extensive field research this topic because the problem matching rejected packet against new new one typically numbering schemes are rfcs internet engineering task force september group testing group testing uses codes different consider large group items which very few are different particular way defective products infected test the idea group testing determine which items are different using few tests the origin the problem has its roots the second world war when the united states army air forces needed test its soldiers for syphilis originated
