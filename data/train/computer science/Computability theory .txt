computability theory computability theory computer navigation search computability computability theory also called recursion theory branch mathematical logic computer science and the theory computation that originated the with the study computable functions and turing degrees the basic questions addressed recursion theory are what does mean for function the natural numbers and how can noncomputable functions classified into hierarchy based their level the answers these questions have led rich theory that still being actively the field has since grown include the study generalized computability and remarkably the invention the central combinatorial object recursion namely the universal turing machine predates and predetermines the invention modern historically the study algorithmically undecidable sets and functions was motivated various problems mathematics that turned for word problem for groups and the there are several applications the theory other branches mathematics that not necessarily concentrate the early applications include the celebrated higman embedding theorem that provides link between recursion theory and group results michael rabin and anatoly maltsev algorithmic presentations and the negative solution hilbert tenth problem the more recent applications include algorithmic randomness results soare who applied theoretic methods solve problem algebraic geometry and the very recent work slaman normal numbers that solves problem analytic number theory recursion theory overlaps with proof theory effective descriptive set theory model theory and abstract arguably computational complexity theory child recursion both theories share the same technical namely the turing machine recursion theorists mathematical logic often study the theory relative reducibility notions and degree structures described this this contrasts with the theory subrecursive hierarchies formal methods and formal languages that common the study computability theory computer there considerable overlap knowledge and methods between these two research however firm line can drawn between for parametrized complexity was invented complexity

see also notes references external links computable and uncomputable sets recursion theory originated the with work kurt del alonzo church alan turing stephen kleene and emil post the fundamental results the researchers obtained established turing computability the correct formalization the informal idea effective these results led stephen kleene coin the two names kleene and kleene nowadays these are often considered single the church turing thesis which states that any function that computable algorithm computable function although initially del argued favor this with definition effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems mathematics that cannot effectively decided church and turing inspired techniques used del prove his incompleteness independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem not effectively this result showed that there algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true many problems mathematics have been shown undecidable after these initial examples were markov and post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot effectively extending this pyotr novikov and william boone showed independently the that the word problem for groups not effectively there effective procedure given word finitely presented group will decide whether the element represented the word the identity element the yuri matiyasevich proved using results julia robinson matiyasevich theorem which implies that hilbert tenth problem has effective this problem asked whether there effective procedure decide whether diophantine equation over the integers has solution the the list undecidable problems gives additional examples problems with computable the study which mathematical constructions can effectively performed sometimes called recursive mathematics the handbook recursive mathematics ershov covers many the known results this turing computability the main form computability studied recursion theory was introduced turing set natural numbers said computable set also called decidable recursive turing computable set there turing machine that given number halts with output the set and halts with output not the function from the natural numbers themselves recursive computable function there turing machine input halts and returns output the use turing machines here not there are many other models computation that have the same computing power turing for example the recursive functions obtained from primitive recursion and the operator the terminology for recursive functions and sets not completely the definition terms recursive functions well different definition rekursiv functions del led the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable turing the word decidable stems from the german word entscheidungsproblem which was used the original papers turing and contemporary the term computable has various according cutland partial recursive function which can undefined for some while according soare total recursive general function this article follows the second these soare gives additional comments about the not every set natural numbers the halting problem which the set descriptions turing machines that halt input known example noncomputable the existence many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countably many turing and thus only countably many computable but there are uncountably many sets natural although the halting problem not possible simulate program execution and produce infinite list the programs that thus the halting problem example recursively enumerable set which set that can enumerated turing machine other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable equivalently set recursively enumerable and only the range some computable the recursively enumerable although not decidable have been studied detail recursion areas research beginning with the theory recursive sets and functions described the field recursion theory has grown include the study many closely related these are not independent areas each these areas draws ideas and results from the and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority relative computability and the turing degrees turing reduction turing degree recursion theory mathematical logic has traditionally focused relative computability generalization turing computability defined using oracle turing machines introduced oracle turing machine hypothetical device addition performing the actions regular turing able ask questions oracle which particular set natural the oracle machine may only ask questions the form the oracle each question will immediately answered even the oracle set not thus oracle machine with noncomputable oracle will able compute sets that turing machine without oracle informally set natural numbers turing reducible set there oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are when run with the oracle set this the set also said relatively computable from and recursive set turing reducible set and turing reducible then the sets are said have the same turing degree also called degree unsolvability the turing degree set gives precise measure how uncomputable the set the natural examples sets that are not including many different sets that encode variants the halting problem have two properties they are recursively enumerable and each can translated into any other via many one reduction that given such sets and there total computable function such that these sets are said many one equivalent equivalent many one reductions are stronger than turing set one reducible set then turing reducible but the converse does not always although the natural examples noncomputable sets are all one possible construct recursively enumerable sets and such that turing reducible but not one reducible can shown that every recursively enumerable set one reducible the halting and thus the halting problem the most complicated recursively enumerable set with respect one reducibility and with respect turing post asked whether every recursively enumerable set either computable turing equivalent the halting that whether there recursively enumerable set with turing degree intermediate between those intermediate post defined natural types recursively enumerable sets like the simple hypersimple and hyperhypersimple post showed that these sets are strictly between the computable sets and the halting problem with respect one post also showed that some them are strictly intermediate under other reducibility notions stronger than turing but post left open the main problem the existence recursively enumerable sets intermediate turing this problem became known post problem after ten kleene and post showed that there are intermediate turing degrees between those the computable sets and the halting but they failed show that any these degrees contains recursively enumerable very soon after friedberg and muchnik independently solved problem establishing the existence recursively enumerable sets intermediate this groundbreaking result opened wide study the turing degrees the recursively enumerable sets which turned out possess very complicated and trivial there are uncountably many sets that are not recursively and the investigation the turing degrees all sets central recursion theory the investigation the recursively enumerable turing many degrees with special properties were hyperimmune free degrees where every function computable relative that degree majorized computable high degrees relative which one can compute function which dominates every computable function the sense that there constant depending such that for all random degrees containing algorithmically random sets generic degrees generic and the degrees below the halting problem limit recursive sets the study arbitrary not necessarily recursively turing degrees involves the study the turing given set the turing jump set natural numbers encoding solution the halting problem for oracle turing machines running with oracle the turing jump any set always higher turing degree than the original and theorem friedburg shows that any set that computes the halting problem can obtained the turing jump another post theorem establishes close relationship between the turing jump operation and the arithmetical hierarchy which classification certain subsets the natural numbers based their definability much recent research turing degrees has focused the overall structure the set turing degrees and the set turing degrees containing recursively enumerable deep theorem shore and slaman states that the function mapping degree the degree its turing jump definable the partial order the turing recent survey spies and fejer gives overview this research and its historical other reducibilities reduction recursion ongoing area research recursion theory studies reducibility relations other than turing post introduced several strong reducibilities named because they imply table turing machine implementing strong reducibility will compute total function regardless which oracle presented weak reducibilities are those where reduction process may not terminate for all turing reducibility one the strong reducibilities one one reducibility one reducible reducible injective function one reducibility one reducible reducible table reducibility cantor space further reducibilities disjunctive conjunctive linear and their weak and bounded are discussed the article reduction recursion the major research strong reducibilities has been compare their both for the class all recursively enumerable sets well for the class all subsets the natural furthermore the relations between the reducibilities has been for known that every turing degree either table degree the union infinitely many table reducibilities weaker than turing reducibility that reducibilities that are implied turing have also been the most well known are arithmetical reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility these reducibilities are closely connected definability over the standard model rice theorem and the arithmetical hierarchy rice showed that for every nontrivial class which contains some but not all sets the index set the set has the property that either the halting problem its complement one reducible that can mapped using many one reduction see rice theorem for more but many these index sets are even more complicated than the halting these type sets can classified using the arithmetical hierarchy for the index set fin class all finite sets the level the index set rec the class all recursive sets the level the index set cofin all cofinite sets also the level and the index set comp the class all complete sets these hierarchy levels are defined contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative contains the recursively enumerable the index sets given here are even complete for their that all the sets these levels can one reduced the given index reverse mathematics reverse mathematics the program reverse mathematics asks which existence axioms are necessary prove particular theorems mathematics subsystems second order arithmetic this study was initiated harvey friedman and was studied detail stephen simpson and simpson gives detailed discussion the the existence axioms question correspond informally axioms saying that the powerset the natural numbers closed under various reducibility the weakest such axiom studied reverse mathematics recursive comprehension which states that the powerset the naturals closed under turing numberings numbering enumeration has two and and outputs the value the function the numbering the input numberings can recursive although some its members are total that computable admissible numberings are those into which all others can friedberg numbering named after its one numbering all recursive necessarily not admissible later research dealt also with numberings other classes like classes recursively enumerable goncharov discovered for example class recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect recursive the priority method for further see the section problem and the priority method the article turing degree problem was solved with method called the priority method proof using this method called priority argument this method primarily used construct recursively enumerable sets with particular use this the desired properties the set constructed are broken into infinite list known requirements that satisfying all the requirements will cause the set constructed have the desired each requirement assigned natural number representing the priority the assigned the most important the second most and the set then constructed each stage attempting satisfy one more the requirements either adding numbers the set banning numbers from the set that the final set will satisfy the may happen that satisfying one requirement will cause another become the priority order used decide what such priority arguments have been employed solve many problems recursion and have been classified into hierarchy based their complexity soare because complex priority arguments can technical and difficult has traditionally been considered desirable prove results without priority see results proved with priority arguments can also proved without for kummer published paper proof for the existence friedberg numberings without using the priority the lattice recursively enumerable sets when post defined the notion simple set set with infinite complement not containing any infinite set started study the structure the recursively enumerable sets under this lattice became studied recursive sets can defined this structure the basic result that set recursive and only the set and its complement are both recursively infinite sets have always infinite recursive but the other simple sets exist but not have coinfinite recursive post introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple later maximal sets were constructed which are sets such that every superset either finite variant the given maximal set post original motivation the study this lattice was find structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property neither the turing degree the recursive sets nor the turing degree the halting post did not find such property and the solution his problem applied priority methods harrington and soare found eventually such automorphism problems another important question the existence automorphisms theoretic one these structures that one recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite this below and only the set difference maximal sets defined the previous have the property that they cannot automorphic maximal that there automorphism the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just then every maximal set mapped another maximal soare showed that also the converse that every two maximal sets are the maximal sets form that every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other some harrington gave further example automorphic that the creative the sets which are one equivalent the halting besides the lattice recursively enumerable automorphisms are also studied for the structure the turing degrees all sets well for the structure the turing degrees sets both cooper claims have constructed nontrivial automorphisms which map some degrees other this construction however not been verified and some colleagues believe that the construction contains errors and that the question whether there nontrivial automorphism the turing degrees still one the main unsolved questions this area slaman and woodin ambos spies and fejer kolmogorov complexity kolmogorov complexity the field kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness was developed during the and kolmogorov levin martin and solomonoff the names are given here alphabetical much the research was and the unity the concept randomness was not understood the the main idea consider universal turing machine and measure the complexity number the length the shortest input such that outputs this approach revolutionized earlier ways determine when infinite sequence characteristic function subset the natural random not invoking notion randomness for finite kolmogorov complexity became not only subject independent study but also applied other subjects tool for obtaining there are still many open problems this for that recent research conference this area was held january and list open problems maintained joseph miller and andre frequency computation this branch recursion theory analyzed the following for fixed and with for which functions possible compute for any different inputs tuple numbers such that least the equations are such sets are known recursive the first major result this branch recursion theory result that set computable recursive for some with the other jockusch semirecursive sets which were already known informally before jockusch introduced them are examples set which recursive and only there are uncountably many these sets and also some recursively enumerable but noncomputable sets this later degtev established hierarchy recursively enumerable sets that are recursive but not after long phase research russian this subject became repopularized the west thesis bounded which linked frequency computation the above mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related one the major results was cardinality theory which states that set computable and only there such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple different numbers many possible choices the cardinality this set numbers intersected with these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out least one false inductive inference this the theoretic branch learning based model learning the limit from and has developed since then more and more models the general scenario the given class computable there learner that recursive which outputs for any input the form learner learns function almost all hypotheses are the same index with respect previously agreed acceptable numbering all computable learns learns every basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes functions are learnable while the class rec all computable functions not many related models have been considered and also the learning classes recursively enumerable sets from positive data topic studied from pioneering paper onwards generalizations turing computability recursion theory includes the study generalized notions this field such arithmetic reducibility hyperarithmetical reducibility and recursion theory described sacks these generalized notions include reducibilities that cannot executed turing machines but are nevertheless natural generalizations turing these studies include approaches investigate the analytical hierarchy which differs from the arithmetical hierarchy permitting quantification over sets natural numbers addition quantification over individual these areas are linked the theories orderings and for example the set all indices recursive trees without infinite branches complete for level the analytical both turing reducibility and hyperarithmetical reducibility are important the field effective descriptive set theory the even more general notion degrees constructibility studied set theory continuous computability theory computability theory for digital computation well computability theory less well developed for analog computation that occurs analog computers analog signal processing analog electronics neural networks and time control theory modelled differential equations and continuous dynamical systems orponen moore relationships between proof and computability there are close relationships between the turing degree set natural numbers and the difficulty terms the arithmetical hierarchy defining that set using first order formula one such relationship made precise post theorem weaker relationship was demonstrated kurt del the proofs his completeness theorem and incompleteness theorems proofs show that the set logical consequences effective order theory recursively enumerable set and that the theory strong enough this set will similarly tarski indefinability theorem can interpreted both terms definability and terms recursion theory also linked second order arithmetic formal theory natural numbers and sets natural the fact that certain sets are computable relatively computable often implies that these sets can defined weak subsystems second order the program reverse mathematics uses these subsystems measure the noncomputability inherent well known mathematical simpson discusses many aspects order arithmetic and reverse the field proof theory includes the study order arithmetic and peano arithmetic well formal theories the natural numbers weaker than peano one method classifying the strength these weak systems characterizing which computable functions the system can prove total see fairtlough and wainer for primitive recursive arithmetic any computable function that provably total actually primitive recursive while peano arithmetic proves that functions like the ackermann function which are not primitive are not every total computable function provably total peano however example such function provided goodstein theorem name the subject the field mathematical logic dealing with computability and its generalizations has been called recursion since its early robert soare prominent researcher the has proposed soare that the field should called computability instead argues that terminology using the word computable more natural and more widely understood than the terminology using the word recursive introduced many contemporary researchers have begun use this alternate these researchers also use terminology such partial computable function and computably enumerable set instead partial recursive function and recursively enumerable set not all researchers have been however explained fortnow and some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail convey the fact that most the objects studied recursion theory are not rogers has suggested that key property recursion theory that its results and structures should invariant under computable bijections the natural numbers this suggestion draws the ideas the erlangen program the idea that computable bijection merely renames numbers rather than indicating any structure the much rotation the euclidean plane does not change any geometric aspect lines drawn since any two infinite computable sets are linked computable this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets the finite computable sets are viewed according the sets interest recursion theory are the noncomputable partitioned into equivalence classes
