computational problem navigation search theoretical computer science computational problem mathematical object representing collection questions that computers might able for the problem factoring computational computational problems are one the main objects study theoretical computer the field algorithms studies methods solving computational problems the complementary field computational complexity attempts explain why certain computational problems are intractable for computational problem can viewed infinite collection instances together with solution for every for example the factoring the instances are the integers and solutions are prime numbers that describe nontrivial prime factors conventional represent both instances and solutions binary strings namely elements for numbers can represented binary strings using the binary for identify numbers with their binary encodings the examples types computational problems decision problem computational problem where the answer for every instance either yes example decision problem primality testing decision problem typically represented the set all instances for which the answer yes for primality testing can represented the infinite set search problem the answers can arbitrary for factoring search problem where the instances are string representations positive integers and the solutions are string representations collections search problem represented relation over consisting all the solution called search relation for factoring can represented the relation which consist all pairs numbers where nontrivial prime factor counting problem asks for the number solutions given search for counting problem associated with factoring counting problem can represented function from the nonnegative for search relation the counting problem associated the function optimization problem asks for finding the best solution among the set all possible solutions search one example the maximum independent set problem independent set optimization problems can represented their search function problem single output total function expected for every but the output more complex than that decision problem that just yes one the most famous examples the travelling salesman problem hard problem combinatorial optimization important operations research and theoretical computer science promise problems promise problem computational complexity theory usually implicitly assumed that any string represents instance the computational problem however sometimes not all strings represent valid and one specifies proper subset the set valid computational problems this type are called promise problems the following example promise the valid instances are those graphs whose maximum independent set size either most least decision promise problems are usually represented pairs disjoint subsets the valid instances are those and represent the instances whose answer yes and respectively promise problems play important role several areas computational complexity including hardness approximation property testing and interactive proof systems
