computer and the best arithmetician that euer and reduceth thy dayes into short number referred person who carried out and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle the from the end the century the word began take its more familiar machine that carries out history history computing hardware rudimentary calculating devices first appeared antiquity and mechanical calculating aids were invented the the first recorded use the word computer also from the applied human computers people who performed calculations often the first computer devices were conceived the and only emerged their modern form the first purpose computing device difference engine charles babbage english mechanical engineer and polymath originated the concept programmable considered the father the computer conceptualised and invented the first mechanical computer the early after working his revolutionary difference engine designed aid navigational realised that much more general analytical engine was the input programs and data was provided the machine via punched cards method being used the time direct mechanical looms such the jacquard loom for the machine would have curve plotter and the machine would also able punch numbers onto cards read the engine incorporated arithmetic logic unit control flow the form conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making the first design for purpose computer that could described modern terms turing complete the machine was about century ahead its all the parts for his machine had made hand this was major problem for device with thousands eventually the project was dissolved with the decision the british government cease babbage failure complete the analytical engine can chiefly attributed difficulties not only politics and but also his desire develop increasingly sophisticated computer and move ahead faster than anyone else could nevertheless his henry completed simplified version the analytical computing unit the mill gave successful demonstration its use computing tables early analogue computers sir william thomson during the first half the many scientific computing needs were met increasingly sophisticated analogue computers which used direct mechanical electrical model the problem basis for computation however these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy modern digital the first modern analogue computer was tide predicting machine invented sir william thomson the differential analyser mechanical analogue computer designed solve differential equations integration using disc was conceptualised james thomson the brother the more famous lord the art mechanical analogue computing reached its zenith with the differential analyser built hazen and vannevar bush mit starting this built the mechanical integrators james thomson and the torque amplifiers invented nieman dozen these devices were built before their obsolescence became the modern computer age begins the principle the modern computer was first described computer scientist alan turing who set out the idea his seminal paper computable numbers turing reformulated kurt del results the limits proof and replacing universal based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known turing machines proved that some such machine would capable performing any conceivable mathematical computation were representable algorithm went prove that there was solution the entscheidungsproblem first showing that the halting problem for turing machines undecidable not possible decide algorithmically whether given turing machine will ever also introduced the notion universal now known universal turing machine with the idea that such machine could perform the tasks any other other provably capable computing anything that computable executing program stored allowing the machine von neumann acknowledged that the central concept the modern computer was due this turing machines are this day central object study theory computation except for the limitations imposed their finite memory modern computers are said turing complete which they have algorithm execution capability equivalent universal turing machine the first electromechanical computers zuse early digital computers were electric switches drove mechanical relays perform the these devices had low operating speed and were eventually superseded much faster electric originally using vacuum tubes the created german engineer konrad zuse was one the earliest examples electromechanical relay zuse followed his earlier machine with the the first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital the was built with relays implementing bit word length that operated clock frequency about program code and data were stored punched film was quite similar modern machines some pioneering numerous advances such floating point numbers replacement the implement decimal system used charles babbage earlier the simpler binary system meant that machines were easier build and potentially more given the technologies available that the was probably complete turing machine the introduction electronic programmable computers with vacuum tubes purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical the same time that digital calculation replaced the engineer tommy flowers working the post office research station london the began explore the possible use electronics for the telephone exchange experimental equipment that built went into operation years converting portion the telephone exchange network into electronic data processing using thousands vacuum tubes the john vincent atanasoff and clifford berry iowa state university developed and tested the atanasoff berry computer the first automatic electronic digital this design was also electronic and used about vacuum with capacitors fixed mechanically rotating drum for colossus electronic digital programmable during world war the british bletchley park achieved number successes breaking encrypted german military the german encryption enigma was first attacked with the help the mechanical bombes crack the more sophisticated german lorenz machine used for level army max newman and his colleagues commissioned flowers build the spent eleven months from early february designing and building the first after functional test december colossus was shipped bletchley where was delivered january and attacked its first message february colossus was the first electronic digital programmable computer used large number valves vacuum had tape input and was capable being configured perform variety boolean logical operations its but was not turing complete nine colossi were built the was converted making ten machines colossus mark contained thermionic valves but mark with valves was both times faster and simpler operate than mark greatly speeding the decoding eniac united states army the built eniac electronic numerical integrator and was the first electronic programmable computer built the although the eniac was similar the colossus was much faster and more was unambiguously complete device and could compute any problem that would fit into its like the program the eniac was defined the states its patch cables and far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came once program was had mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting plugs and combined the high speed electronics with the ability programmed for many complex could add subtract times thousand times faster than any other also had modules divide and square high speed memory was limited words about bytes built under the direction john mauchly and presper eckert the university eniac development and construction lasted from full operation the end the machine was weighing tons using kilowatts electric power and contained over vacuum relays and hundreds thousands capacitors and stored program computers eliminate the need for wiring manchester scale experimental machine early computing machines had fixed changing its function required the wiring and structuring the with the proposal the program computer this program computer includes design instruction set and can store memory set instructions program that details the computation the theoretical basis for the program computer was laid alan turing his paper turing joined the national physical laboratory and began work developing electronic program digital his report proposed electronic was the first specification for such john von neumann the university pennsylvania also circulated his first draft report the edvac ferranti mark the manchester scale experimental nicknamed baby was the first stored program computer was built the victoria university manchester frederic williams tom kilburn and geoff and ran its first program june was designed testbed for the williams tube the first random access digital storage although the computer was considered small and the standards its was the first working machine contain all the elements essential modern electronic soon the ssem had demonstrated the feasibility its project was initiated the university develop into more usable the manchester mark the mark turn quickly became the prototype for the ferranti mark the first commercially available purpose built ferranti was delivered the university manchester february least seven these later machines were delivered between and one them shell labs amsterdam october the directors british catering company lyons company decided take active role promoting the commercial development the leo computer became operational april and ran the first regular routine office computer job transistors replace vacuum tubes computers bipolar junction transistor the bipolar transistor was invented from onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes computer giving rise the second compared vacuum transistors have many they are and require less power than vacuum give off less silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had indefinite service transistorized computers could contain tens thousands binary logic circuits relatively compact the university manchester team under the leadership tom kilburn designed and built machine using the newly developed transistors instead their first transistorised computer and the first the was operational and second version was completed there april however the machine did make use valves generate its khz clock waveforms and the circuitry read and write its magnetic drum memory was not the first completely transistorised that distinction goes the harwell cadet built the electronics division the atomic energy research establishment harwell integrated circuits replace transistors the next great advance computing power came with the advent the integrated circuit the idea the integrated circuit was first conceived radar scientist working for the royal radar establishment the ministry defence geoffrey dummer dummer presented the first public description integrated circuit the symposium progress quality electronic components washington may the first practical ics were invented jack kilby texas instruments and robert noyce fairchild semiconductor kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit july successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example september his patent application february kilby described his new device body semiconductor material wherein all the components the electronic circuit are completely noyce also came with his own idea integrated circuit half year later than his chip solved many practical problems that had produced fairchild was made silicon whereas chip was made germanium this new development heralded explosion the commercial and personal use computers and led the invention the microprocessor while the subject exactly which device was the first microprocessor partly due lack agreement the exact definition the term microprocessor largely undisputed that the first chip microprocessor was the intel designed and realised ted hoff federico faggin and stanley mazor intel mobility and the growth smartphone computers with the continued miniaturisation computing and advancements portable battery portable computers grew popularity the citation needed the same developments that spurred the growth laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers integrate computing resources into cellular these called smartphones run variety operating systems and are rapidly becoming the dominant computing device the with manufacturers reporting having shipped estimated million devices programs the defining feature modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines that they can programmed that say that some type instructions the program can given the and will process modern computers based the von neumann architecture often have machine code the form imperative programming language practical computer program may just few instructions extend many millions the programs for word processors and web browsers for typical modern computer can execute billions instructions per second gigaflops and rarely makes mistake over many years large computer programs consisting several million instructions may take teams programmers years and due the complexity the task almost certainly contain stored program architecture computer program computer programming program computer museum science and industry this section applies most common ram machine based most computer instructions are add one number move some data from one location send message some external etc these instructions are read from the memory and are generally carried out executed the order they were however there are usually specialised instructions tell the computer jump ahead backwards some other place the program and carry executing from these are called instructions branches furthermore jump instructions may made happen conditionally that different sequences instructions may used depending the result some previous calculation some external many computers directly support subroutines providing type jump that the location jumped from and another instruction return the instruction following that jump program execution might likened reading while person will normally read each word and line they may times jump back earlier place the text skip sections that are not similarly computer may sometimes back and repeat the instructions some section the program over and over again until some internal condition this called the flow control within the program and what allows the computer perform tasks repeatedly without human comparatively person using pocket calculator can perform basic arithmetic operation such adding two numbers with just few button but add together all the numbers from would take thousands button presses and lot with near certainty making the other computer may programmed this with just few simple for once told run this the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human will almost never make mistake and modern can complete the task about millionth machine code most individual instructions are stored machine code with each instruction being given unique number its operation code opcode for the command add two numbers together would have one the command multiply them would have different and the simplest computers are able perform any handful different the more complex computers have several hundred choose each with unique numerical since the memory able store can also store the instruction this leads the important fact that entire programs which are just lists these can represented lists numbers and can themselves manipulated inside the computer the same way numeric the fundamental concept storing programs the memory alongside the data they operate the crux the von stored program citation needed architecture some computer might store some all its program memory that kept separate from the data operates this called the harvard architecture after the harvard mark computer modern von neumann computers display some traits the harvard architecture their such cpu caches while possible write computer programs long lists numbers machine language and while this technique was used with many early extremely tedious and potentially prone especially for complicated instead each basic instruction can given short name that indicative its function and easy mnemonic such sub mult these mnemonics are collectively known assembly language converting programs written assembly language into something the computer can actually understand machine usually done computer program called punched card fortran programming language programming language programming languages provide various ways specifying programs for computers unlike natural languages programming languages are designed permit ambiguity and they are purely written languages and are often difficult read they are generally either translated into machine code compiler assembler before being translated directly run time interpreter sometimes programs are executed hybrid method the two low level languages level programming language machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them collectively termed low level programming languages tend unique particular type for arm architecture computer such may found pda hand held videogame cannot understand the machine language intel pentium the amd athlon computer that might higher level languages level programming language though considerably easier than machine writing long programs assembly language often difficult and also error therefore most practical programs are written more abstract high level programming languages that are able express the needs the programmer more conveniently and thereby help reduce programmer high level languages are usually into machine language sometimes into assembly language and then into machine using another computer program called compiler high level languages are less related the workings the target computer than assembly and more related the language and structure the solved the final therefore often possible use different compilers translate the same high level language program into the machine language many different types this part the means which software like video games may made available for different computer architectures such personal computers and various video game consoles program design this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed july program design small programs relatively simple and involves the analysis the collection using the programming constructs within devising using established procedures and providing data for output devices and solutions the problem problems become larger and more features such modules formal and new paradigms such oriented programming are large programs involving thousands line code and more require formal software the task developing large software systems presents significant intellectual producing software with acceptably high reliability within predictable schedule and budget has historically been the academic and professional discipline software engineering concentrates specifically this bugs software bug errors computer programs are called bugs they may benign and not affect the usefulness the have only subtle but some they may cause the program the entire system hang becoming unresponsive input such mouse clicks completely crash otherwise benign bugs may sometimes harnessed for malicious intent unscrupulous user writing exploit code designed take advantage bug and disrupt proper bugs are usually not the fault the since computers merely execute the instructions they are bugs are nearly always the result programmer error oversight made the admiral grace hopper american computer scientist and developer the first compiler credited for having first used the term computing after dead moth was found shorting relay the harvard mark computer september components central processing unit microprocessor play media general purpose computer has four main the arithmetic logic unit the control unit the memory and the input and output devices collectively termed these parts are interconnected buses often made groups wires inside each these parts are thousands trillions small electrical circuits which can turned off means electronic switch each circuit represents bit binary information that when the circuit represents and when off represents positive logic the circuits are arranged logic gates that one more the circuits may control the state one more the other the control alu registers and basic and often other hardware closely linked with are collectively known central processing unit early cpus were composed many separate components but since the cpus have typically been constructed single integrated circuit called microprocessor control unit cpu design control unit mips architecture the control unit often called control system central manages the various reads and interprets the program transforming them into series control signals which activate other parts the control systems advanced computers may change the order some instructions improve key component common all cpus the program counter special memory cell register that keeps track which location memory the next instruction read the control function note that this simplified and some these steps may performed concurrently different order depending the type read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated the program decode the numerical code for the instruction into set commands signals for each the other increment the program counter points the next read whatever data the instruction requires from cells memory perhaps from input the location this required data typically stored within the instruction provide the necessary data alu the instruction requires alu specialised hardware instruct the hardware perform the requested write the result from the alu back memory location register perhaps output jump back step since the program counter just another set memory can changed calculations done the adding the program counter would cause the next instruction read from place locations further down the instructions that modify the program counter are often known and allow for loops instructions that are repeated the and often conditional instruction execution both examples control flow the sequence operations that the control unit goes through process instruction itself like short computer and some more complex cpu there another yet smaller computer called microsequencer which runs microcode program that causes all these events arithmetic logic unit arithmetic logic unit the alu capable performing two classes arithmetic and the set arithmetic operations that particular alu supports may limited addition and might include division trigonometry functions such cosine etc and square roots some can only operate whole numbers integers whilst others use floating point represent real numbers albeit with limited however any computer that capable performing just the simplest operations can programmed break down the more complex operations into simple steps that can therefore any computer can programmed perform any arithmetic although will take more time its alu does not directly support the alu may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values true depending whether one equal greater than less than the other greater than logic operations involve boolean logic and xor and not these can useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic superscalar computers may contain multiple allowing them process several instructions graphics processors and computers with simd and mimd features often contain alus that can perform arithmetic vectors and matrices memory computer data storage magnetic core memory memory can viewed list cells into which numbers can placed each cell has numbered and can store single the computer can instructed put the number into the cell numbered add the number that cell the number that cell and put the answer into cell the information stored memory may represent practically letters numbers even computer instructions can placed into memory with equal since the cpu does not differentiate between different types the responsibility give significance what the memory sees nothing but series almost all modern each memory cell set store binary numbers groups eight bits called byte each byte able represent different numbers either from store larger several consecutive bytes may used two four when negative numbers are they are usually stored two complement notation other arrangements are but are usually not seen outside specialised applications historical computer can store any kind information memory can represented modern computers have billions even trillions bytes the cpu contains special set memory cells called registers that can read and written much more rapidly than the main memory there are typically between two and one hundred registers depending the type registers are used for the most frequently needed data items avoid having access main memory every time data data constantly being worked reducing the need access main memory which often slow compared the alu and control greatly increases the computer main memory comes two principal random access memory ram and read only memory ram can read and written anytime the cpu commands but rom preloaded with data and software that never therefore the cpu can only read from rom typically used store the initial the contents ram are erased when the power the computer turned but rom retains its data the rom contains specialised program called the bios that orchestrates loading the operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer turned embedded computers which frequently not have disk all the required software may stored software stored rom often called firmware because notionally more like hardware than flash memory blurs the distinction between rom and retains its data when turned off but also typically much slower than conventional rom and ram its use restricted applications where high speed more sophisticated computers there may one more ram cache memories which are slower than registers but faster than main generally computers with this sort cache are designed move frequently needed data into the cache often without the need for any intervention the input output input output hard disk drives the means which computer exchanges information with the outside devices that provide input output the computer are called peripherals typical personal peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse and output devices such the display and printer hard disk drives floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve both input and output computer networking another form devices are often complex computers their own with their own cpu and graphics processing unit might contain fifty more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary display graphics citation needed modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main cpu performing multitasking computer multitasking while computer may viewed running one gigantic program stored its main some systems necessary give the appearance running several programs this achieved multitasking having the computer switch rapidly between running each program one means which this done with special signal called interrupt which can periodically cause the computer stop executing instructions where was and something else remembering where was executing prior the the computer can return that task several programs are running the same then the interrupt generator might causing several hundred interrupts per causing program switch each since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders magnitude faster than human may appear that many programs are running the same time even though only one ever executing any given this method multitasking sometimes termed since each program allocated time before the era cheap the principal use for multitasking was allow many people share the same seemingly multitasking would cause computer that switching between several programs run more direct proportion the number programs but most programs spend much their time waiting for slow output devices complete their program waiting for the user click the mouse press key the then will not take time until the event waiting for has this frees time for other programs execute that many programs may run simultaneously without unacceptable speed multiprocessing multiprocessing cray some computers are designed distribute their work across several cpus multiprocessing technique once employed only large and powerful machines such supercomputers mainframe computers and servers multiprocessor and multi core multiple cpus single integrated personal and laptop computers are now widely and are being increasingly used end markets supercomputers particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic program architecture and from general purpose they often feature thousands customised speed and specialised computing such designs tend useful only for specialised
