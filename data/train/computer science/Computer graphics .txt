help from specialized graphic hardware and the interaction and understanding computers and interpretation data has been made easier because computer computer graphic development has had significant impact many types media and have revolutionized animation movies and the video game industry contents overview history initial developments further developments image types two dimensional pixel art vector graphics three dimensional computer animation concepts and principles pixel graphics rendering volume rendering modeling pioneers graphic design other pioneers study computer graphics applications references further reading external links overview the term computer graphics has been used broad sense describe almost everything computers that not text typically the term computer graphics refers several different the representation and manipulation image data computer the various technologies used create and manipulate images the field computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual see study computer graphics computer graphics widespread computer imagery found for example weather for example all kinds medical investigation and surgical constructed graph can present complex statistics form that easier understand and the media such graphs are used illustrate reports thesis and other presentation many powerful tools have been developed visualize computer generated imagery can categorized into several different two dimensional three dimensional and animated technology has computer graphics have become more but computer graphics are still widely computer graphics has emerged field computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual over the past other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization and scientific visualization more concerned with the visualization three dimensional phenomena meteorological medical biological etc where the emphasis realistic renderings surfaces illumination and perhaps with dynamic component history history computer animation sage the precursor sciences the development modern computer graphics were the advances electrical engineering electronics and television that took place during the first half the twentieth screens could display art since the lumiere brothers use mattes create special effects for the earliest films dating from but such displays were limited and not the oscilloscope the complex avionics control panel and the naval control panels the world war period would prove the more direct precursors the they provided the first dimensional electronic displays that responded user early projects like the whirlwind and sage projects introduced the crt viable display and interaction interface and introduced the light pen input device programmer for the whirlwind sage system performed personal experiment which small program wrote captured the movement his finger and displayed its vector his traced display the same douglas ross working mit transforming mathematic statements into computer generated machine tool vectors took the opportunity create display scope image disney cartoon one the first interactive videogames feature interactive graphics was created for oscilloscope william higinbotham entertain visitors brookhaven national laboratory and simulated tennis the phrase computer itself was coined william fetter graphic designer for boeing the field computer graphics developed with the emergence computer graphics initial developments further advances computing led greater advancements interactive computer graphics the computer was developed mit lincoln laboratory the integrated number new machine light pen could used draw sketches the computer using ivan sutherland revolutionary sketchpad software using light sketchpad allowed one draw simple shapes the computer save them and even recall them the light pen itself had small photoelectric cell its this cell emitted electronic pulse whenever was placed front computer screen and the electron gun fired directly simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location the electron was easy pinpoint exactly where the pen was the screen any given once that was the computer could then draw cursor that sutherland seemed find the perfect solution for many the graphics problems even many standards computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early sketchpad one example this drawing one wants draw square for they not have worry about drawing four lines perfectly form the edges the one can simply specify that they want draw and then specify the location and size the the software will then construct perfect with the right dimensions and the right another example that software modeled objects not just picture other with model one could change the size the tires without affecting the rest the could stretch the body the car without deforming the further developments spacewar computer history museum also another student steve russell created the first video spacewar written for the dec pdp spacewar was instant success and copies started flowing other owners and eventually even dec got citation needed the engineers dec used diagnostic program every new before shipping the sales force picked this quickly enough and when installing new would run the first video game for their new zajac scientist bell telephone laboratory created film called simulation giro gravity attitude control this computer generated zajac showed how the attitude satellite could altered orbits the created the animation ibm mainframe also ken knowlton frank sindon and michael noll started working the computer graphics sindon created film called force mass and motion illustrating newton laws motion around the same other scientists were creating computer graphics illustrate their lawrence radiation laboratory nelson max created the flow viscous and propagation shock waves solid boeing aircraft created film called vibration was not long before major corporations started taking interest computer trw lockheed georgia general electric and sperry rand are among the many companies that were getting started computer graphics the ibm was quick respond this interest releasing the ibm graphics the first commercially available graphics pong ralph baer supervising engineer sanders associates came with home video game that was later licensed magnavox and called the odyssey while very and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic allowed the player move points light around was the first consumer computer graphics david evans was director engineering bendix corporation computer division from after which worked for the next five years visiting professor there continued his interest computers and how they interfaced with the university utah recruited evans form computer science and computer graphics quickly became his primary this new department would become the primary research center for computer also sutherland mit invented the first computer controlled head mounted display called the sword damocles because the hardware required for displayed two separate wireframe one for each this allowed the viewer see the computer scene stereoscopic after receiving his from sutherland became director information processing arpa advanced research projects and later became professor sutherland was recruited evans join the computer science program the university utah there perfected his twenty years nasa would discover his techniques their virtual reality research sutherland and evans were highly sought after consultants large companies but they were frustrated the lack graphics hardware available the time they started formulating plan start their own the acm initiated special interest group graphics siggraph which organizes conferences graphics standards and publications within the field computer the first annual siggraph conference was which has become one the focuses the siggraph has grown size and importance the field computer graphics has expanded over many the most important early breakthroughs computer graphics research occurred the university utah the student the name edwin catmull started the university utah and signed for sutherland computer graphics catmull had just come from the boeing company and had been working his degree growing disney catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that did not have the talent for now catmull along with many saw computers the natural progression animation and they wanted part the the first animation that catmull saw was his created animation his hand opening and became one his goals produce feature length motion picture using computer the same fred parke created animation his because and was gaining quite reputation the place for computer graphics research catmull went there learn the computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all john warnock was one those early would later found adobe systems and create revolution the publishing world with his postscript page description tom stockham led the image processing group which worked closely with the computer graphics jim clark was also would later found silicon inc the first major advance computer graphics was created these early the surface order draw representation object the the computer must determine which surfaces are behind the object from the and thus should hidden when the computer creates the the core graphics system core was the first graphical standard group experts the acm special interest group siggraph developed this conceptual the specifications were published and became foundation for many future development the the early the availability bit slice and bit microprocessors started revolutionise high resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became semi standalone and standalone graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated the intelligence the rather than continuing rely central mainframe and mini computers typical the early move high resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the aided engineering market were the orca and workstations developed orcatech off from bell northern research and led early workstation pioneer david computer scientist the orca was based motorola and amd slice processors and had unix its operating was targeted squarely the sophisticated end the design engineering artists and graphic designers began see the personal particularly the commodore amiga and macintosh serious design one that could save time and draw more accurately than other the late sgi computers were used create some the first fully generated short films pixar the macintosh remains highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and modern dating from the often use graphical user interfaces present data and information with icons and rather than graphics are one the five key elements multimedia technology quarxs maurice benayoun ois schuiten graphics became more popular the gaming multimedia and animation the end the and beginning the nineties were the very first computer graphics vie des studio mac guff ligne les fables triques grall georges lacroix and renato studio and quarxs the first hdtv computer graphics series maurice benayoun and fran ois schuiten studio toy story the first length generated animation was released cinemas quake one the first fully games was computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such directx and opengl since computer graphics have only become more detailed and due more powerful graphics hardware and modeling software this section requires expansion october cgi was adopted masse for television advertisments this and became familiar massive computer graphics used films and video games gradually began realistic the point entering the uncanny valley examples include the later final fantasy games and animated films like the polar express rendering capabilities became standard feature even inexpensive shaders which had been introduced the perform specialized processing the gpu would the end the decade become speeding graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved texture and shading computer graphics via the widespread adoption normal mapping bump mapping and variety other techniques allowing the simulation great amount the early half the cgi nearly ubiquitous pre rendered graphics are nearly photorealistic and even realtime graphics suitably end system may simulate photorealism the untrained shaders are maturing considerably and are now very nearly necessity for advanced work the providing considerable complexity manipulating pixels vertices and textures element and countless possible experiments into the processing power required provide graphics resolution modes like ultra are though beyond reach all but the end image types two dimensional raster graphic sprites computer graphics are the based generation digital images mostly from such digital and techniques specific computer graphics are mainly used applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies such those the dimensional image not just representation world but independent artifact with added semantic two dimensional models are therefore because they give more direct control the image than computer graphics whose approach more akin photography than typography pixel art large form digital art being pixel art created through the use raster graphics software where images are edited the pixel level graphics most old relatively computer and video graphing calculator games and many mobile phone games are mostly pixel vector graphics vector graphics formats are complementary raster graphics raster graphics the representation images array pixels and typically used for the representation photographic vector graphics consists encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the which can allow for more flexibility there are instances when working with vector tools and formats best and instances when working with raster tools and formats best there are times when both formats come understanding the advantages and limitations each technology and the relationship between them most likely result efficient and effective use three dimensional graphics compared graphics are graphics that use three dimensional representation geometric for the purpose performance this stored the this includes images that may for later display for time despite these computer graphics rely similar algorithms computer graphics the frame and raster graphics like the final rendered computer graphics the distinction between and occasionally applications may use techniques achieve effects such and primarily may use rendering computer graphics are the same the model contained within the graphical data apart from the however there are differences that include the model the representation any until visually displayed model not due models are not only confined virtual rendering how model can also can used graphical computer simulations and computer animation computer animation motion capture fractal landscape generated imagery computer animation the art creating moving images via the use computers subfield computer graphics and animation increasingly created means computer graphics though computer graphics are still widely used for low and faster real time rendering needs sometimes the target the animation the computer but sometimes the target another medium such film also referred cgi computer generated imagery generated especially when used virtual entities may contain and controlled assorted such transform values orientation and stored transformation matrix animation the change attribute over multiple methods achieving animation the rudimentary form based the creation and editing keyframes each storing value given per attribute the graphics software will change with each creating editable curve value mapped over which results other methods animation include procedural and expression based the former consolidates related elements animated entities into sets useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations the latter allows evaluated result returned from defined logical coupled with automate animation predictable way convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what hierarchy offers skeletal system set create the illusion image displayed the computer screen then quickly replaced new image that similar the previous but shifted this technique identical the illusion movement television and motion pictures concepts and principles images are typically devices such cameras mirrors lenses telescopes microscopes etc digital images include both vector images and raster images but raster images are more commonly pixel digital pixel picture element single point raster image pixels are placed regular dimensional and are often represented using dots each pixel sample original where more samples typically provide more accurate representation the the intensity each pixel color each pixel has typically three components such red green and blue graphics graphics are visual presentations such computer examples are drawing graphics maps engineering drawings other images graphics often combine text and graphic design may consist the deliberate creation arrangement typography flier poster web book without any other clarity effective communication may the association with other cultural elements may the creation distinctive rendering rendering generating model means computer scene file contains objects strictly defined language data would contain viewpoint texture lighting and shading information description the virtual the data contained the scene file then passed rendering program processed and output digital image raster graphics image the rendering program usually built into the computer graphics though others are available ins entirely separate the term rendering may analogy with though the technical details rendering methods the general challenges overcome producing image from representation stored scene file are outlined the graphics pipeline along rendering such gpu gpu device able assist the cpu scene look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual the rendering software should solve the rendering equation the rendering equation does not account for all lighting but general lighting model for generated also used describe the process
