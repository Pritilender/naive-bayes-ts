modern digital computer machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such the abacus have existed since aiding computations such multiplication and blaise pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical pascal calculator gottfried leibniz demonstrated digital mechanical called the stepped reckoner may considered the first computer scientist and information for among other documenting the binary number thomas colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when released his simplified arithmometer which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough used daily office charles babbage started the design the first automatic mechanical calculator his difference engine which eventually gave him the idea the first programmable mechanical calculator his analytical engine started developing this machine and less than two years had sketched out many the salient features the modern computer crucial step was the adoption punched card system derived from the jacquard making infinitely during the translation french article the analytical engine ada lovelace wrote one the many notes she algorithm compute the bernoulli numbers which considered the first computer around herman hollerith invented the tabulator which used punched cards process statistical eventually his company became part ibm one hundred years after impossible howard aiken convinced which was making all kinds punched card equipment and was also the calculator business develop his giant programmable the ascc harvard mark based analytical engine which itself used cards and central computing when the machine was some hailed dream come during the new and more powerful computing machines were the term computer came refer the machines rather than their human became clear that computers could used for more than just mathematical the field computer science broadened study computation computer science began established distinct academic discipline the and early the first computer science degree the cambridge diploma computer science began the university cambridge computer laboratory the first computer science degree program the united states was formed purdue university since practical computers became many applications computing have become distinct areas study their own although many initially believed was impossible that computers themselves could actually scientific field the late fifties gradually became accepted among the greater academic the now known ibm brand that formed part the computer science revolution during this ibm short for international business released the ibm and later the ibm computers which were widely used during the exploration period such working with the ibm was you had misplaced much one letter one the program would and you would have start the whole process over during the late the computer science discipline was very much its developmental and such issues were time has seen significant improvements the usability and effectiveness computing modern society has seen significant shift the users computer from usage only experts and ubiquitous user initially computers were quite and some degree human aid was needed for efficient use part from professional computer computer adoption became more widespread and less human assistance was needed for common major achievements german enigma machine world war bletchley park despite its short history formal academic computer science has made number fundamental contributions science and society along with electronics founding science the current epoch human history called the information age and driver the information revolution seen the third major leap human technological progress after the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution bce these contributions the start the digital revolution which includes the current information age and the internet formal definition computation and computability and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems the concept programming language tool for the precise expression methodological information various levels cryptography breaking the enigma code was important factor contributing the allied victory world war scientific computing enabled practical evaluation processes and situations great well experimentation entirely also enabled advanced study the and mapping the human genome became possible with the human genome project distributed computing projects such folding home explore protein folding algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity financial markets using artificial intelligence machine learning and other statistical and numerical techniques large high frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility computer graphics and computer generated imagery have become ubiquitous modern entertainment particularly television cinema advertising animation and video games even films that feature explicit cgi are usually filmed now digital cameras edited postprocessed using digital video citation needed simulation various including computational fluid dynamics physical electrical and electronic systems and well societies and social situations notably war along with their among many modern computers enable optimization such designs complete notable electrical and electronic circuit design are spice well software for physical realization new designs the latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits citation needed artificial intelligence becoming increasingly important gets more efficient and there are many applications the some which can seen such robotic vacuum cleaners also present video games and the modern battlefield anti missile and squad support robots philosophy philosophy computer science number computer scientists have argued for the distinction three separate paradigms computer peter wegner argued that those paradigms are technology and peter denning working group argued that they are abstraction and amnon eden described them the rationalist which treats computer science branch which prevalent theoretical computer and mainly employs deductive reasoning the technocratic which might found engineering approaches most prominently software engineering and the scientific which approaches related artifacts from the empirical perspective natural sciences identifiable some branches artificial intelligence name the field the term computer appears article communications the acm which louis fein argues for the creation graduate school computer sciences analogous the creation harvard business school justifying the name arguing like management science the subject applied and interdisciplinary while having the characteristics typical academic his and those others such numerical analyst george forsythe were universities went create such starting with purdue despite its significant amount computer science does not involve the study computers because several alternative names have been certain departments major universities prefer the term computing science emphasize precisely that danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data while not necessarily involving the first scientific institution use the term was the department datalogy the university founded with peter naur being the first professor the term used mainly the scandinavian also the early days number terms for the practitioners the field computing were suggested the communications the acm turingineer turologist flow man applied mathematician and applied epistemologist three months later the same comptologist was followed next year hypologist the term computics has also been terms derived from contracted translations the expression automatic informazione information and are often informatique informatik informatica the inform tica portugal informatika slavic languages pliroforiki which means greek similar words have also been adopted the the school informatics the university edinburgh folkloric often attributed but almost certainly not first formulated edsger dijkstra states that computer science more about computers than astronomy about note the design and deployment computers and computer systems generally considered the province disciplines other than computer for the study computer hardware usually considered part computer engineering while the study commercial computer systems and their deployment often called information technology information systems however there has been much fertilization ideas between the various related computer science research also often intersects other such philosophy cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics statistics and logic computer science considered some have much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific with some observers saying that computing mathematical early computer science was strongly influenced the work mathematicians such kurt del and alan turing and there continues useful interchange ideas between the two fields areas such mathematical logic category theory domain theory and algebra the relationship between computer science and software engineering contentious which further muddied disputes over what the term software means and how computer science david parnas taking cue from the relationship between other engineering and science has claimed that the principal focus computer science studying the properties computation while the principal focus software engineering the design specific computations achieve practical making the two separate but complementary the political and funding aspects computer science tend depend whether department formed with mathematical emphasis with engineering computer science departments with mathematics emphasis and with numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science both types departments tend make efforts bridge the field educationally not across all areas computer science computer science spans range topics from theoretical studies algorithms and the limits computation the practical issues implementing computing systems hardware and csab formerly called computing sciences accreditation board which made representatives the association for computing machinery and the ieee computer society identifies four areas that considers crucial the discipline computer theory computation algorithms and data structures programming methodology and languages and computer elements and architecture addition these four csab also identifies fields such software artificial computer networking and database parallel distributed computer human computer operating and numerical and symbolic computation being important areas computer theoretical computer science theoretical computer science the broader field theoretical computer science encompasses both the classical theory computation and wide range other topics that focus the more logical and mathematical aspects theory computation theory computation according peter denning the fundamental question underlying computer science what can automated the study the theory computation focused answering fundamental questions about what can computed and what amount resources are required perform those effort answer the first computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable various theoretical models computation the second question addressed computational complexity theory which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches solving multitude computational the famous problem one the millennium prize problems open problem the theory terces automata theory computability theory computational complexity theory cryptography quantum computing theory information and coding theory information theory coding theory information theory related the quantification this was developed claude shannon find fundamental limits signal processing operations such compressing data and reliably storing and communicating coding theory the study the properties codes systems for converting information from one form and their fitness for specific codes are used for data compression cryptography error detection and correction and more recently also for network coding codes are studied for the purpose designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods algorithms and data structures algorithms and data structures the study commonly used computational methods and their computational analysis algorithms algorithms data structures computational geometry programming language theory programming language theory programming language theory branch computer science that deals with the implementation analysis characterization and classification programming languages and their individual features falls within the discipline computer both depending and affecting mathematics software engineering and linguistics active research with numerous dedicated academic type theory compiler design programming languages formal methods formal methods formal methods are particular kind mathematically based technique for the specification development and verification software and hardware systems the use formal methods for software and hardware design motivated the expectation other engineering performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute the reliability and robustness they form important theoretical underpinning for software especially where safety security formal methods are useful adjunct software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give framework for for industrial tool support however the high cost using formal methods means that they are usually only used the development integrity and life critical systems where safety security utmost formal methods are best described the application fairly broad variety theoretical computer science fundamentals particular logic calculi formal languages automata theory and program semantics but also type systems and algebraic data types problems software and hardware specification and applied computer science applied computer science aims identifying certain computer science concepts that can used directly solving real world artificial intelligence artificial intelligence this branch computer science aims required synthesise orientated processes such decision environmental learning and communication which are found humans and from its origins cybernetics and the dartmouth conference artificial intelligence research has been necessarily drawing areas expertise such applied mathematics symbolic logic semiotics electrical engineering philosophy mind neurophysiology and social intelligence associated the popular mind with robotic development but the main field practical application has been embedded component areas software development which require computational understanding and modeling such finance and data mining and the physical citation needed the point the late was alan turing question can computers and the question remains effectively unanswered although the turing test still used assess computer output the scale human but the automation evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful substitute for human monitoring and intervention domains computer application involving complex world machine learning computer vision image processing pattern recognition cognitive science data mining evolutionary

projected among the fastest growing occupations from and computer programming the great insights computer science the philosopher computing bill rapaport noted three great insights computer science leibniz boole alan turing shannon morse there are only objects that computer has deal with order represent anything digital physics alan turing there are only actions that computer has perform order anything turing machine and jacopini there are only ways combining these actions into more complex that are needed order for computer anything sequence selection repetition note that the rules and insight can further simplified with the use goto which means more elementary than structured programming elementary function arithmetic friedman grand conjecture academia conferences list computer science conferences conferences are strategic events the academic research computer during those researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and proceedings these conferences are important part the computer science journals category computer science journals education some universities teach computer science theoretical study computation and algorithmic these programs often feature the theory computation analysis algorithms formal methods concurrency theory databases computer graphics and systems analysis among they typically also teach computer programming but treat vessel for the support other fields computer science rather than central focus level the joint curriculum task force computing curriculum and update gives guideline for university other colleges and well secondary schools and vocational programs that teach computer emphasize the practice advanced programming rather than the theory algorithms and computation their computer science such curricula tend focus those skills that are important workers entering the software the process aspects computer programming are often referred software engineering while computer science professions increasingly drive the economy computer science education absent most american curricula report entitled running the failure teach computer science the digital was released october association for computing machinery and computer science teachers association and revealed that only states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer the report also found that only nine states count high school computer science courses core academic subject their graduation tandem with running new partisan advocacy coalition computing the core was founded influence federal and state such the computer science education act which calls for grants states develop plans for improving computer science education and supporting computer science within the united states gender gap computer science education has been observed research conducted the wgbh educational foundation and the association for computing machinery revealed that more than twice many high school boys considered computer science very college major than high school the high school advanced placement exam for computer science has displayed disparity compared other subjects has the lowest number female with composition about percent this gender gap computer science further witnessed the college where percent undergraduate computer science degrees are earned women and only percent computer science faculty consists according article published the epistemic games group august the number women graduates the computer science field has declined percent mother jones article can code advocates
