external data requirements simulations and models vary for the input might just few numbers for simulation waveform electricity while others might require terabytes information such weather and climate input sources also vary sensors and other physical devices connected the control surfaces used direct the progress the simulation some current historical data entered values extracted product from other values output for the purpose other models lastly the time which data available invariant data often built into the model either because the value truly invariant the value because the designers consider the value invariant for all cases data can entered into the simulation when starts for example reading one more reading data from preprocessor data can provided during the simulation for example sensor because this and because diverse simulation systems have many common there are large number specialized simulation the known may simula sometimes called after the year when was there are now many others systems that accept data from external sources must very careful knowing what they are while easy for computers read values from text binary what much harder knowing what the accuracy compared measurement resolution and precision the values often they are expressed error minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value expected lie because digital computer mathematics not rounding and truncation errors multiply this useful perform error confirm that values output the simulation will still usefully even small errors the original

actually implemented analog computers where the differential equations could represented directly various electrical components such amps the late however most analog simulations were run conventional digital computers that emulate the behavior analog special type discrete simulation that does not rely model with underlying but can nonetheless represented agent based simulation based the individual entities such cells trees the model are represented directly rather than their density and possess internal state and set behaviors rules that determine how the state updated from one step the distributed models run network interconnected possibly through the internet simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred distributed there are several standards for distributed including aggregate level simulation protocol distributed interactive simulation the high level architecture and the test and training enabling architecture visualization formerly the output data from computer simulation was sometimes presented table matrix showing how data were affected numerous changes the simulation the use the matrix format was related traditional use the

results are often aggregated into static images using various ways scientific visualization simulating program execution under test rather than executing can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect the same log useful debugging information such instruction memory alterations and instruction this technique can also detect buffer overflow and similar hard errors well produce performance information and tuning data pitfalls although sometimes ignored computer very important perform sensitivity analysis ensure that the accuracy the results properly for the probabilistic risk analysis factors determining the success oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from variety statistical distributions using the monte carlo method for one the key parameters the net ratio bearing known only one significant then the result the simulation might not more precise than one significant although might presented having four significant model calibration techniques the following three steps should used produce accurate simulation calibration verification and computer simulations are good portraying and comparing theoretical but order accurately model actual case studies they have match what actually happening base model should created and calibrated that matches the area being the calibrated model should then verified ensure that the model operating expected based the once the model has been the final step validate the model comparing the outputs historical data from the study this can done using statistical techniques and ensuring adequate squared unless these techniques are the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not useful prediction model calibration achieved adjusting any available parameters order adjust how the model operates and simulates the for traffic typical parameters include ahead car following discharge and lost these parameters influence driver behavior such when and how long takes driver change how much distance driver leaves between his car and the car front and how quickly driver starts accelerate through adjusting these parameters has direct effect the amount traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network making the drivers more less these are examples calibration parameters that can tuned match characteristics observed the field the study most traffic models have typical default values but they may need adjusted better match the driver behavior the specific location being model verification achieved obtaining output data from the model and comparing them what expected from the input for traffic traffic volume can verified ensure that actual volume throughput the model reasonably close traffic volumes input into the ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volumes are reasonably close input simulation models handle model inputs different ways traffic that enters the for may may not reach its desired additionally traffic that wants enter the network may not able congestion this why model verification very important part the modeling the final step validate the model comparing the results with what expected based historical data from the study ideally the model should produce similar results what has happened this typically verified nothing more than quoting the squared statistic from the this statistic measures the fraction variability that accounted for the high squared value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data another tool used validate models graphical residual model output values drastically differ from historical probably means there error the before using the model base produce additional important verify for different scenarios ensure that each one the outputs not reasonably match historic values during the validation the model should reviewed and updated produce results more line with iterative process that helps produce more realistic validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated the model observed traffic the roadway and transit initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between sectors other large areas the next step compare traffic estimated the models traffic including transit crossing contrived barriers the study these are typically called cutlines and cordon lines and may imaginary actual physical cordon lines surround particular areas such central business district other major activity transit ridership estimates are commonly validated comparing them actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business three sources error can cause weak correlation during input model and parameter input error and parameter error can adjusted easily the model error however caused the methodology used the model and may not easy simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting some models are more generalized while others are more model error occurs may necessary adjust the model methodology make results more order produce good models that can used produce realistic these are the necessary steps that need taken order ensure that simulation models are functioning simulation models can used tool verify engineering but they are only valid calibrated once satisfactory estimates the parameters for all models have been the models must checked assure that they adequately perform the intended the validation process establishes the credibility the model demonstrating its ability replicate actual traffic the importance model validation underscores the need for careful thoroughness and accuracy the input data collection program that has this efforts should made ensure collected data consistent with expected for traffic analysis typical for traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns the the resulting models and forecasts will better than the data used for model
