without priori the term data appeared around the database for short time phrase database was but since was trademarked san based company now merged into fico pitch their database mining researchers consequently turned data other terms used include data information information knowledge etc gregory shapiro coined the term knowledge discovery for the first workshop the same topic and this term became more popular and machine learning however the term data mining became more popular the business and press currently data mining and knowledge discovery are used since about predictive and since data terms were also used describe this background the manual extraction patterns from data has occurred for early methods identifying patterns data include bayes theorem and regression analysis the ubiquity and increasing power computer technology has dramatically increased data storage and manipulation data sets have grown size and direct data analysis has increasingly been augmented with automated data aided other discoveries computer such neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms decision trees and support vector machines data mining the process applying these methods with the intention uncovering hidden patterns large data bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical database management exploiting the way data stored and indexed databases execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more allowing such methods applied ever larger data research and evolution the premier professional body the

process the knowledge discovery databases process commonly defined with the data mining however many variations this such the cross industry standard process for data mining which defines six simplified process such pre data and results polls conducted and show that the methodology the leading methodology used data the only other data mining standard named these polls was semma however times many people reported using several teams researchers have published reviews data mining process and azevedo and santos conducted comparison and semma pre processing before data mining algorithms can target data set must data mining can only uncover patterns actually present the the target data set must large enough contain these patterns while remaining concise enough mined within acceptable time common source for data data mart data warehouse pre processing essential analyze the multivariate data sets before data the target set then data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data data mining data mining involves six common classes anomaly detection deviation the identification unusual data that might interesting data errors that require further association rule learning dependency searches for relationships between for example supermarket might gather data customer purchasing using association rule the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing this sometimes referred market basket clustering the task discovering groups and structures the data that are some way another similar without using known structures the classification the task generalizing known structure apply new for mail program might attempt classify mail legitimate spam regression attempts find function which models the data with the least summarization providing more compact representation the data including visualization and report results validation data mining can unintentionally and can then produce results which appear but which not actually predict future behavior and cannot reproduced new sample data and bear little often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing simple version this problem machine learning known overfitting but the same problem can arise different phases the process and thus test split when applicable all may not sufficient prevent this from citation needed this section missing information about classification tasks data only covers machine learning please expand the section include this further details may exist the talk page september the final step knowledge discovery from data verify that the patterns produced the data mining algorithms occur the wider data not all patterns found the data mining algorithms are necessarily common for the data mining algorithms find patterns the training set which are not present the general data this called overfitting overcome the evaluation uses test set data which the data mining algorithm was not the learned patterns are applied this test and the resulting output compared the desired for data mining algorithm trying distinguish spam from legitimate emails would trained training set sample once the learned patterns would applied the test set mails which had not been the accuracy the patterns can then measured from how many mails they correctly number statistical methods may used evaluate the such roc curves the learned patterns not meet the desired subsequently necessary evaluate and change the processing and data mining the learned patterns meet the desired then the final step interpret the learned patterns and turn them into standards there have been some efforts define standards for the data mining for example the european cross industry standard process for data mining and the java data mining standard jdm development successors these processes and jdm was active but has stalled jdm was withdrawn without reaching final for exchanging the extracted models particular for use predictive analytics the key standard the predictive model markup language which xml based language developed the data mining group and supported exchange format many data mining the name only covers prediction particular data mining task high importance business however extensions cover for subspace clustering have been proposed independently the notable uses has been suggested that this section split into new article titled examples data mining discuss proposed since january category applied data mining games since the early with the availability oracles for certain combinatorial games also called tablebases for with any beginning small board dots boxes small and certain endgames dots and new area for data mining has been this the extraction usable strategies from these current pattern recognition approaches not seem fully acquire the high level abstraction required applied instead extensive experimentation with the tablebases combined with intensive study answers well designed and with knowledge prior art pre tablebase used yield insightful berlekamp etc and john nunn chess endgames are notable examples researchers doing this though they were not and are not involved tablebase business data mining the analysis historical business stored static data data warehouse the goal reveal hidden patterns and data mining software uses advanced pattern recognition algorithms sift through large amounts data assist discovering previously unknown strategic business examples what businesses use data mining for include performing market analysis identify new product finding the root cause manufacturing prevent customer attrition and acquire new cross sell existing and profile customers
