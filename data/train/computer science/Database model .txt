introducing more precise february database model type data model that determines the logical structure database and fundamentally determines which manner data can organized and the most popular example database model the relational model which uses based common logical data models for databases hierarchical database model network model relational model relationship model enhanced relationship model object model document model value model star schema object relational database combines the two related physical data models include inverted index flat file other models associative model multidimensional model multivalue model semantic model xml database named graph triplestore contents relationships and functions flat model early data models hierarchical model network model inverted file model relational model dimensional model post relational database models graph model multivalue model object oriented database models references relationships and functions given database management system may provide one more the five the optimal structure depends the natural organization the and the which include transaction rate reliability maintainability scalability and most database management systems are built around one particular data although possible for products offer support for more than one various physical data models can implement any given logical most database software will offer the user some level control tuning the physical since the choices that are made have significant effect model not just way structuring also defines set operations that can performed the the relational for defines operations such select project and join although these operations may not explicit particular query language they provide the foundation which query language flat model flat file database spreadsheet the flat model consists two dimensional array data elements where all members given column are assumed similar and all members row are assumed related one for columns for name and password that might used part system security each row would have the specific password associated with individual columns the table often have type associated with defining them character date time integers floating point this tabular format precursor the relational early data models these models were popular the but nowadays can found primarily old legacy systems they are characterized primarily being navigational with strong connections between their logical and physical and deficiencies data independence hierarchical model hierarchical model hierarchical model data organized into tree like structure implying single parent for each sort field keeps sibling records particular hierarchical structures were widely used the early mainframe database management such the information management system ibm and now describe the structure xml documents this structure allows one many relationship between two types this structure very efficient describe many relationships the real recipes table ordering any nested and sorted this hierarchy used the physical order records record access done navigating through the data structure using pointers combined with sequential because the hierarchical structure inefficient for certain database operations when full path opposed upward link and sort not also included for each such limitations have been compensated for later ims versions additional logical hierarchies imposed the base physical network model network model the network model expands upon the hierarchical allowing many relationships like structure that allows multiple was the most popular before being replaced the relational and defined the codasyl specification the network model organizes data using two fundamental called records and sets records contain fields which may organized the programming language cobol sets not confused with mathematical define one many disambiguation needed relationships between one many record may owner any number and member any number set consists circular linked lists where one record the set owner appears once each and second record the subordinate may appear multiple times each this way hierarchy may established between any two record type the owner the same time another set may defined where the owner thus all the sets comprise general directed graph ownership defines network construct access records either sequential usually each record navigation the circular linked the network model able represent redundancy data more efficiently than the hierarchical and there can more than one path from ancestor node the operations the network model are navigational program maintains current and navigates from one record another following the relationships which the record records can also located supplying key although not essential feature the network databases generally implement the set relationships means pointers that directly address the location record this gives excellent retrieval the expense operations such database loading and popular dbms products that utilized were cincom systems total and cullinet idms idms gained considerable customer the adopted the relational model and sql addition its original tools and most object databases invented the use the navigational concept provide fast navigation across networks generally using object identifiers smart pointers related objectivity for implements named one many and many named relationships that can cross many object databases also support sql combining the strengths both inverted file model inverted index inverted file inverted index the contents the data are used keys lookup and the values the table are pointers the location each instance given content this also the logical structure contemporary database indexes which might only use the contents from particular columns the lookup the inverted file data model can put indexes second set files next existing flat database order efficiently directly access needed records these notable for using this data model the adabas dbms software introduced adabas has gained considerable customer base and exists and supported until the has adopted the relational model and sql addition its original tools and relational model relational model the relational model was introduced codd way make database management systems more independent any particular mathematical model defined terms predicate logic and set theory and systems implementing have been used midrange and microcomputer the products that are generally referred relational databases fact implement model that only approximation the mathematical model defined three key terms are used extensively relational database relations attributes and domains relation table with columns and the named columns the relation are called and the domain the set values the attributes are allowed the basic data structure the relational model the where information about particular entity represented rows also called tuples and thus the relation relational refers the various tables the relation set the columns enumerate the various attributes the entity the address phone for and row actual instance the entity specific that represented the each tuple the employee table represents various attributes single all relations thus tables relational database have adhere some basic rules qualify first the ordering columns immaterial second there identical tuples rows and each tuple will contain single value for each its relational database contains multiple each similar the one the flat database one the strengths the relational model any value occurring two different records belonging the same table different implies relationship among those two yet order enforce explicit integrity constraints relationships between records tables can also defined identifying identifying child relationships characterized assigning cardinality tables can also have designated single attribute set attributes that can act key which can used uniquely identify each tuple the key that can used uniquely identify row table called primary keys are commonly used join combine data from two more for employee table may contain column named location which contains value that matches the key location table keys are also critical the creation which facilitate fast retrieval data from large any column can multiple columns can grouped together into compound not necessary define all the keys column can used key even was not originally intended key that has real world meaning such isbn serial sometimes called natural key natural key suitable think the many people named brown arbitrary surrogate key can assigned such giving employees most databases have both generated and natural because generated keys can used internally create links between rows that cannot while natural keys can less for searches and for integration with other for records two independently developed databases could matched social security number except when the social security numbers are missing have the most common query language used with the relational model the structured query language sql dimensional model the dimensional model specialized adaptation the relational model used represent data data warehouses way that data can easily summarized using online analytical olap queries the dimensional database schema consists single large table facts that are described using dimensions and dimension provides the context fact such who when and where and its and used queries group related facts dimensions tend discrete and are often for the location might include the state and measure quantity describing the such important that measures can meaningfully for the revenue from different locations can added olap dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together create the dimensional model often implemented top the relational model using star schema consisting one highly normalized table containing the and surrounding denormalized tables containing each alternative physical called snowflake schema normalizes level hierarchies within dimension into multiple data warehouse can contain multiple dimensional schemas that share dimension allowing them used coming with standard set dimensions important part dimensional modeling its high performance has made the dimensional model the most popular database structure for post relational database models products offering more general data model than the relational model are sometimes classified post relational alternate terms include hybrid enhanced and the data model such products incorporates relations but not constrained codd information which requires that all information the database must cast explicitly terms values relations and other way some these extensions the relational model integrate concepts from technologies that date the relational for they allow representation directed graph with trees the the german company sones implements this concept its graphdb some relational products extend relational systems with relational others arrived much the same place adding relational features relational paradoxically this allows products that are historically such pick and mumps make plausible claim the resource space model relational data model based dimensional graph model graph database graph databases allow even more general structure than network any node may connected any other multivalue model multivalue multivalue databases are lumpy data that they can store exactly the same way relational but they also permit level depth which the relational model can only approximate using this nearly identical the way xml expresses where given attribute can have multiple right answers the same multivalue can thought compressed form example which either multivalue relational data could seen invoice header table one entry per and invoice detail table one entry per line the multivalue have the option storing the data with embedded table represent the invoice table one entry per other tables the advantage that the atomicity the invoice and the invoice data are this also results fewer less referential integrity and dramatic decrease the hardware needed support given transaction object oriented database models object relational model object model the the object oriented programming paradigm was applied database creating new database model known object databases this aims avoid the object relational impedance mismatch the overhead converting information between its representation the database for example rows and its representation the application program typically even the type system used particular application can defined directly the allowing the database enforce the same data integrity object databases also introduce the key ideas object such encapsulation and polymorphism into the world variety these ways have been tried for storing objects some products have approached the problem from the application programming making the objects manipulated the program persistent this typically requires the addition some kind query since conventional programming languages not have the ability find objects based their information others have attacked the problem from the database defining oriented data model for the and defining database programming language that allows full programming capabilities well traditional query object databases suffered because lack although standards were defined odmg they were never implemented well enough ensure interoperability between nevertheless object databases have been used successfully many usually specialized applications such engineering databases molecular biology databases rather than mainstream commercial data however object database ideas were picked the relational vendors and influenced extensions made these products and indeed the sql language alternative translating between objects and relational databases use object relational mapping library
