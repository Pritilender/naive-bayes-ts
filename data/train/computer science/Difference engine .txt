computer science	difference engine navigation search the difference engine science museum difference engine automatic mechanical calculator designed tabulate polynomial functions the name derives from the method divided differences way interpolate tabulate functions using small set polynomial both logarithmic and trigonometric functions functions commonly used both navigators and can approximated difference engine can compute many useful sets the historical difficulty producing free tables teams mathematicians and human computers spurred charles babbage desire build mechanism automate the contents history operation timing steps subtraction method differences initial values use derivatives curve fitting see also references further reading external links history wikisource astronomische volume babbage new machine for calculating and printing mathematical and astronomical tables ller engineer the hessian army conceived the idea difference this was described book published but ller was unable obtain funding progress with the june charles babbage proposed the use such machine paper the royal astronomical society entitled note the application machinery the computation astronomical and mathematical this machine used the decimal number system and was powered cranking the british government was since producing tables was time consuming and expensive and they hoped the difference engine would make the task more the british government gave babbage start work the although design was technically one had built mechanical device such exacting standards the engine proved much more expensive than the time the government killed the project they had given babbage over without receiving working what babbage did was unwilling recognize was that the government was interested economically produced not the engine the other issue that undermined the confidence the difference engine was babbage had moved analytical developing something babbage had rendered the difference engine useless the eyes the babbage went design his much more general analytical engine but later produced improved difference engine design between and babbage was able take advantage ideas developed for the analytical engine make the new difference engine calculate more quickly while using fewer inspired difference engine per georg scheutz built several difference engines from onwards one which was sold the british government martin wiberg improved construction but used his device only for producing and publishing printed logarithmic tables during the allan bromley associate professor the university sydney australia studied original drawings for the difference and analytical engines the science museum library this work led the science museum construct working difference engine from under doron swade the then curator this was celebrate the anniversary the printer which babbage originally designed for the difference engine was also the conversion the original design drawings into drawings suitable for engineering use revealed some minor errors design possibly introduced protection case the plans were which had once both the engine and its printer worked and still the difference engine and printer were constructed tolerances achievable with century resolving standing debate whether design would actually have one the reasons formerly advanced for the completion engines had been that engineering methods were insufficiently developed the victorian the primary purpose produce stereotype plates for use printing which does pressing type into soft plaster create flong babbage intended that the results conveyed directly mass having recognized that errors previous tables were not the result human calculating mistakes but from error the manual typesetting process the paper output mainly means checking the addition funding the construction the output mechanism for the science difference engine nathan myhrvold commissioned the construction second complete difference engine which currently exhibit the computer history museum mountain california operation play media the difference engine consists number numbered from the machine able store one decimal number each the machine can only add the value column column produce the new value column can only store constant column displays and possibly prints the value the calculation the current iteration the engine programmed setting initial values the column set the value the polynomial the start column set value derived from the first and higher derivatives the polynomial the same value each the columns from set value derived from the first and higher derivatives the timing the babbage one iteration one full set addition and carry operations happens once for each rotation the main odd and even columns alternately perform addition one the sequence operations for column count receiving the value from column addition perform carry propagation the counted value count down adding column reset the counted down value its original value steps occur for every odd column while steps occur for every even while original design placed the crank directly the main was later realized that the force required crank the machine would have been too great for human therefore the two models that were built incorporate reduction gear the and four revolutions the crank are required perform one full steps each iteration creates new and accomplished four steps corresponding four complete turns the handle shown the far right the picture the four steps step all even numbered columns are added all odd numbered columns simultaneously interior sweep arm turns each even column cause whatever number each wheel count down wheel turns transfers its value sector gear located between the even these values are transferred the odd column causing them count any odd column value that passes from activates carry lever step carry propagation accomplished set spiral arms the back that poll the carry levers helical manner that carry any level can increment the wheel above that can create which why the arms move the same the sector gears are returned their original which causes them increment the even column wheels back their original the sector gears are high one side they can lifted disengage from the odd column wheels while they still remain contact with the even column step this like step except odd columns added even columns and column one has its values transferred sector gear the print mechanism the left end the any even column value that passes from activates carry the column value the result for the sent the attached printer step this like step but for doing carries even and returning odd columns their original subtraction the engine represents negative numbers ten complements subtraction amounts addition negative this works exactly the same manner that modern computers perform known two complement method differences computer history museum mountain california the principle difference engine newton method divided differences the initial value polynomial and its finite differences calculated some means for some value the difference engine can calculate any number nearby using the method generally known the method finite differences for consider the quadratic polynomial with the goal tabulating the values and the table below constructed the second column contains the values the the third column contains the differences the two left neighbors the second and the fourth column contains the differences the two neighbors the third the numbers the third column are starting with any polynomial degree the column number will always this the crucial fact behind the success the this table was built from left but possible continue building from right left down diagonal order compute more calculate use the values from the lowest start with the fourth column constant value and copy down the then continue the third column adding get next continue the second column taking its previous and adding the from the third thus order compute iterate the same algorithm the values take from the fourth add that the third value get then add that the second value get which this process may continued infinitum the values the polynomial are produced without ever having difference engine only needs able from one loop the needs store numbers this example the last elements the first and second tabulate polynomials degree one needs sufficient storage hold numbers babbage difference engine finally built could hold numbers decimal digits each and could thus tabulate degree polynomials that the best machines from scheutz could store numbers with digits citation needed initial values the initial values columns can calculated first manually calculating consecutive values the function and backtracking calculating the required col gets the value the function the start computation col the difference between and the function calculated polynomial function expressed the initial values can calculated directly from the constant coefficients without calculating any data the initial values are col col col col col col use derivatives many commonly used functions are analytic functions which can expressed power series for example taylor series the initial values can calculated any degree done correctly the engine will give exact results for first after the engine will only give approximation the the taylor series expresses the function sum obtained from its derivatives one for many functions the higher derivatives are trivial for the sine function has values for all setting the start computation get the simplified maclaurin series the same method calculating the initial values from the coefficients can used for polynomial the polynomial constant coefficients will now have the value curve fitting the problem with the methods described above that errors will accumulate and the series will tend diverge from the true solution which guarantees constant maximum error use curve fitting minimum values are calculated evenly spaced along the range the desired using curve fitting technique like gaussian reduction degree polynomial interpolation the function with the optimized the initial values can calculated see also mathematics portal computing portal analytical engine babbage proposed general purpose computer
