digital object identifier navigation search for the use digital object identifiers see wikipedia digital object identifier digital object identifier doi character string digital used uniquely identify object such electronic document metadata about the object stored association with the doi name and this metadata may include such url where the object can the doi for document remains fixed over the lifetime the whereas its location and other metadata may referring online document its doi provides more stable linking than simply referring its because its url the publisher need only update the metadata for the doi link the new doi name differs from standard identifier registries such the isbn and the purpose identifier registry manage given collection whereas the primary purpose the doi system make collection identifiers actionable and organizations that meet the contractual obligations the doi system and are willing pay become member the system can assign the doi system implemented through federation registration agencies coordinated the international doi which developed and controls the the doi system has been developed and implemented range publishing applications since late april more than million doi names had been assigned some organizations april this number had grown million doi names assigned through organizations the doi system but not formally part the handle system contents nomenclature applications features and benefits comparison with other identifier schemes resolution organizational structure standardization see also notes references external links nomenclature doi name takes the form character string divided into two prefix and separated the prefix identifies the registrant the and the suffix chosen the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that most legal unicode characters are allowed these which are interpreted case insensitive manner for the doi name the prefix and the suffix the part the prefix identifies the doi and the characters the prefix identify the this case the registrant the international doi foundation the item identifying single object this the latest version the doi handbook the official doi handbook explicitly states that dois shall displayed screens and print the format doi names can identify creative works such images audio video and both electronic and physical performances and abstract works such parties etc the names can refer objects varying levels thus doi names can identify individual issue individual article the single table that the choice level detail left the but the doi system must declared part the metadata that associated doi using data dictionary based the indecs content model applications major applications the doi system currently persistent citations

the international doi citation needed features and benefits the doi system was designed provide form persistent which each doi name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object which and associates metadata with allowing provide users with relevant pieces information about the objects and their included part this metadata are network actions that allow doi names resolved web locations where the objects they describe can achieve its the doi system combines the handle system and the indecs content model with social the handle system ensures that the doi name for object not based any changeable attributes the object such its physical location that the attributes the object are encoded its metadata rather than its doi and that two objects are assigned the same doi because doi names are short character they are may copied and pasted and fit into the uri specification the doi name resolution mechanism acts behind the that users communicate with the same way with any other web built open architectures incorporates trust mechanisms and engineered operate reliably and flexibly that can adapted changing demands and new applications the doi doi name resolution may used with openurl select the most appropriate among multiple locations for given according the location the user making the however despite this the doi system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users free copies documents that would have been available for additional fee from alternative the indecs content model used within the doi system associate metadata with small kernel common metadata shared all doi names and can optionally extended with other relevant which may public registrants may update the metadata for their doi names any such when publication information changes when object moves different the international doi foundation oversees the integration these technologies and operation the system through technical and social the social infrastructure federation independent registration agencies offering doi services was modelled existing successful federated deployments identifiers such and isbn comparison with other identifier schemes doi name differs from commonly used internet pointers such the uniform resource locator that identifies object itself first class entity rather than the specific place where the object located certain implements the uniform resource identifier uniform resource name concept and adds data model and social doi name also differs from standard identifier registries such the isbn isrc etc the purpose identifier registry manage given collection whereas the primary purpose the doi system make collection identifiers actionable and where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled the doi system offers semantically interoperable resolution related current data and best suited material that will used services outside the direct control the issuing assigner public citation managing content uses managed registry providing social and technical does not assume any specific business model for the provision identifiers services and enables other existing services link defined several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been the comparison persistent identifier approaches difficult because they are not all doing the same imprecisely referring set schemes identifiers doesn mean that they can compared other identifier may enabling technologies with low barriers providing easy use labeling mechanism that allows anyone set new instance examples include persistent uniform resource locator urls globally unique identifiers etc but may lack some the functionality controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata controlled the doi system does not have this approach and should not compared directly such identifier various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some the features offered the doi system for specific sectors ark doi name does not depend the location this similar uniform resource name purl but differs from ordinary urls are often used substitute identifiers for documents the internet better characterised uniform resource although the same document two different locations has two persistent identifiers such doi names identify objects first class two instances the same object would have the same doi resolution doi name resolution provided through the handle system developed corporation for national research initiatives and freely available any user encountering doi resolution redirects the user from doi name one more pieces typed urls representing instances the services such one more items the handle doi name and has set values assigned and may thought record that consists group each handle value must have data type specified its field that defines the syntax and semantics its resolve doi may input doi resolver www org may represented http string preceding the doi name the string for the doi name can resolved the address web pages other hypertext documents can include hypertext links this some browsers allow the direct resolution doi other with cnri handle extension for firefox the cnri handle extension for firefox enables the browser access handle doi uris like using the native handle system will even replace references handle proxy servers with native organizational structure the international doi foundation profit organisation created the governance body the doi safeguards all intellectual property rights relating the doi manages common operational and supports the development and promotion the doi the idf ensures that any improvements made the doi system including maintenance registration resolution and policymaking doi are available any doi also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those the idf users the doi the idf controlled board elected the members the with appointed managing agent who responsible for ordinating and planning its membership open all organizations with interest electronic publishing and related enabling the idf holds annual open meetings the topics doi and related registration appointed the provide services doi they allocate doi register doi and provide the necessary infrastructure allow registrants declare and maintain metadata and state registration agencies are also expected actively promote the widespread adoption the doi cooperate with the idf the development the doi system and provide services behalf their specific user list current ras maintained the international doi registration agencies generally charge fee assign new doi parts these fees are used support the the doi system through the operates not profit cost
