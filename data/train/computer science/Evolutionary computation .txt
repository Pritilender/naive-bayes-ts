science evolutionary computation subfield artificial intelligence more particularly computational intelligence that involves continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization problems its algorithms can considered global optimization methods with metaheuristic stochastic optimization character and are mostly applied for black box problems derivatives often the context expensive evolutionary computation uses iterative such growth development this population then selected guided random search using parallel processing achieve the desired such processes are often inspired biological mechanisms evolution evolution can produce highly optimised processes and has many applications computer science contents history techniques evolutionary algorithms some evolutionary computation practitioners software see also bibliography references history the use darwinian principles for automated problem solving originated the was not until the that three distinct interpretations this idea started developed three different evolutionary programming was introduced lawrence fogel the while john henry holland called his method genetic algorithm germany ingo rechenberg and hans paul schwefel introduced evolution strategies these areas developed separately for about years from the early nineties they are unified different representatives one called evolutionary also the early fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged genetic programming since the evolutionary computation has largely become based and inspired algorithms are becoming increasingly significant these terminologies denote the field evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary evolution genetic and genetic programming simulations evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started with the work nils aall barricelli the and was extended alex fraser who published series papers simulation artificial selection artificial evolution became widely recognised optimisation method result the work ingo rechenberg the and early who used evolution strategies solve complex engineering genetic algorithms particular became popular through the writing john holland academic interest dramatic increases the power computers allowed practical including the automatic evolution computer evolutionary algorithms are now used solve dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced human and also optimise the design techniques evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve metaheuristic optimization algorithms broadly the field

computation that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired biological evolution such reproduction mutation recombination natural selection and survival the fittest candidate solutions the optimization problem play the role individuals and the cost function determines the environment within which the solutions live see also fitness function evolution the population then takes place after the repeated application the above this there are two main forces that form the basis evolutionary recombination and mutation create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate while selection acts force increasing many aspects such evolutionary process are stochastic changed pieces information due recombination and mutation are randomly the other selection operators can either the latter individuals with higher fitness have higher chance selected than individuals with lower fitness but typically even the weak individuals have chance become
