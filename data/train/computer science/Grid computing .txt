strategies grid computing use middleware divide and apportion pieces program among several sometimes many grid computing involves computation distributed which may also involve the aggregation scale the size grid may vary from confined network computer workstations within for public collaborations across many companies and the notion confined grid may also known nodes cooperation whilst the notion wider grid may thus refer nodes grids are form distributed computing whereby super virtual composed many networked loosely coupled computers acting together perform very large this technology has been applied computationally intensive mathematical and academic problems through volunteer computing and used commercial enterprises for such diverse applications drug discovery economic forecasting seismic analysis and back office data processing support for commerce and web services coordinating applications grids can complex especially when coordinating the flow information across distributed computing grid workflow systems have been developed specialized form workflow management system designed specifically compose and execute series computational data manipulation the grid comparison grids and conventional supercomputers computing general special type parallel computing that relies complete computers with onboard storage power network etc connected network public the internet conventional network interface producing commodity compared the lower efficiency designing and constructing small number custom the primary performance disadvantage that the various processors and local storage areas not have speed this arrangement thus suited applications which multiple parallel computations can take place without the need communicate intermediate results between the end scalability geographically dispersed grids generally due the low need for connectivity between nodes relative the capacity the public citation needed there are also some differences programming and can costly and difficult write programs that can run the environment which may have custom operating require the program address concurrency issues problem can adequately layer infrastructure can allow standalone given different part the same run multiple this makes possible write and debug single conventional and eliminates complications due multiple instances the same program running the same shared memory and storage space the same design considerations and variations this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding

known multiple administrative domains this can facilitate commercial utility computing make easier assemble volunteer computing networks one disadvantage this feature that the computers which are actually performing the calculations might not entirely the designers the system must thus introduce measures prevent malfunctions malicious participants from producing misleading erroneous and from using the system attack this often involves assigning work randomly different nodes presumably with different and checking that least two different nodes report the same answer for given work discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious due the lack central control over the there way guarantee that nodes will not drop out the network random some nodes like laptops dialup internet may also available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable these variations can accommodated assigning large work units thus reducing the need for continuous network and reassigning work units when given node fails report its results expected the impacts trust and availability performance and development difficulty can influence the choice whether deploy onto dedicated idle machines internal the developing open external network volunteers many the participating nodes must trust the central system not abuse the access that being interfering with the operation other mangling stored transmitting private creating new security other systems employ measures reduce the amount trust nodes must place the central system such placing applications virtual public systems those crossing administrative domains including different departments the same often result the need run heterogeneous systems using different operating systems and hardware architectures with many there trade off between investment software development and the number platforms that can supported and thus the size the resulting cross platform languages can reduce the need make this trade though potentially the expense high performance any given node due time interpretation lack optimization for the particular there are diverse scientific and commercial projects harness particular associated grid for the purpose setting new boinc common one for various academic projects seeking public more are listed the end the article the middleware can seen layer between the hardware and the top the number technical areas have and these may may not middleware example areas include sla management trust and virtual organization license portals and data these technical areas may taken care commercial though the cutting edge each area often found within specific research projects examining the market segmentation the grid computing market for the segmentation the grid computing two perspectives need the provider side and the user the provider side the overall grid market comprises several specific these are the grid middleware the market for enabled the utility computing market and the service market grid middleware specific software which enables the sharing heterogeneous and virtual installed and integrated into the existing infrastructure the involved company and provides special layer placed among the heterogeneous infrastructure and the specific user major grid middlewares are globus toolkit glite and unicore utility computing referred the provision grid computing and applications service either open grid utility hosting solution for one organization major players the utility computing market are sun microsystems ibm and grid enabled applications are specific software applications that can utilize grid this made possible the use grid pointed out software service software that delivered and managed remotely one more gartner additionally saas applications are based single set common code and data they are consumed many and saas uses pay you model subscription model that based providers saas not necessarily own the computing resources which are required run their therefore saas providers may draw upon the utility computing the utility computing market provides computing resources for saas the user side for companies the demand user side the grid computing the different segments have significant implications for their deployment the deployment strategy well the type investments made are relevant aspects for potential grid users and play important role for grid cpu scavenging cpu scavenging cycle scavenging shared computing creates from the unused resources network participants whether worldwide internal typically this technique uses desktop computer instruction cycles that would otherwise wasted during even the scattered seconds throughout the day when the computer waiting for user input slow participating computers also donate some supporting amount disk storage ram and network addition raw cpu citation needed many volunteer computing projects such boinc use the cpu scavenging since nodes are likely offline from time their owners use their resources for their primary this model must designed handle such history the term grid computing originated the early metaphor for making computer power easy access electric power grid the power grid metaphor for accessible computing quickly became canonical when ian foster and carl kesselman published their seminal the blueprint for new computing cpu scavenging and volunteer computing were popularized beginning distributed net and later seti home harness the power networked pcs order solve intensive research citation needed the ideas the grid including those from distributed object oriented and web were brought together ian carl and steve tuecke widely regarded the fathers the they led the effort create the globus toolkit incorporating not just computation management but also storage management security data monitoring and toolkit for developing additional services based the same including agreement notification trigger and information while the globus toolkit remains the facto standard for building grid number other tools have been built that answer some subset services needed create enterprise global the
