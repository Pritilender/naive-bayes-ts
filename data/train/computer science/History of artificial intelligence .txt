hermes trismegistus wrote that discovering the true nature the man has been able reproduce formal reasoning artificial intelligence based the assumption that the process human thought can the study formal reasoning has long chinese indian and greek philosophers all developed structured methods formal deduction the first millennium their ideas were developed over the centuries philosophers such aristotle who gave formal analysis the syllogism euclid whose elements was model formal who developed algebra and gave his name algorithm and european scholastic philosophers such william ockham and duns scotus majorcan philosopher ramon llull developed several logical machines devoted the production knowledge logical llull described his machines mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths simple logical produced the machine mechanical such ways produce all the possible llull work had great influence gottfried leibniz who redeveloped his gottfried leibniz the leibniz thomas hobbes and ren descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could made systematic algebra hobbes famously wrote leviathan reason nothing but leibniz envisioned universal language reasoning his characteristica universalis which would reduce argumentation that there would more need disputation between two philosophers than between two for would suffice take their pencils down their and say each other with friend they let calculate these philosophers had begun articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith the the study mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem the foundations had been set such works boole the laws thought and frege begriffsschrift building frege russell and whitehead presented formal treatment the foundations mathematics their the principia mathematica inspired russell david hilbert challenged mathematicians the and answer this fundamental can all mathematical reasoning his question was answered del incompleteness proof turing machine and church lambda calculus their answer was surprising two first they proved that there limits what mathematical logic could but second and more important for their work suggested within these any form mathematical reasoning could the church turing thesis implied that mechanical shuffling symbols simple and could imitate any conceivable process mathematical the key insight was the turing machine simple theoretical construct that captured the essence abstract symbol this invention would inspire handful scientists begin discussing the possibility thinking computer science history computer hardware history computer science calculating machines were built antiquity and improved throughout history many including once philosopher gottfried leibniz the early charles babbage designed programmable computer the analytical engine although was never ada lovelace speculated that the machine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces music any degree complexity she often credited the first programmer because set notes she wrote that completely detail method for calculating bernoulli numbers with the the first modern computers were the massive code breaking machines the second world war such eniac and colossus the latter two these machines were based the theoretical foundation laid alan turing and developed john von neumann the birth artificial intelligence note the sections this article the and handful scientists from variety fields psychology engineering economics and political began discuss the possibility creating artificial the field artificial intelligence research was founded academic discipline cybernetics and early neural networks the earliest research into thinking machines was inspired confluence ideas that became prevalent the late and early recent research neurology had shown that the brain was electrical network neurons that fired nothing norbert wiener cybernetics described control and stability electrical claude shannon information theory described digital signals all nothing alan turing theory computation showed any form computation could described the close relationship between these ideas suggested that might possible construct electronic brain examples work this vein includes robots such grey walter turtles and the johns hopkins beast these machines did not use digital electronics symbolic they were controlled entirely analog walter pitts and warren mcculloch analyzed networks idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical they were the first describe what later researchers would call neural network one the students inspired pitts and mcculloch was young marvin minsky then year old graduate with dean built the first neural net the snarc minsky was become one the most important leaders and innovators for the next years game using the ferranti mark machine the university manchester christopher strachey wrote checkers program and dietrich prinz wrote one for arthur samuel checkers developed the middle and early eventually achieved sufficient skill challenge respectable game would continue used measure progress throughout its turing test alan turing published landmark paper which speculated about the possibility creating machines with true noted that intelligence difficult define and devised his famous turing test machine could carry conversation over teleprinter that was indistinguishable from conversation with human then the machine could called this simplified version the problem allowed turing argue convincingly that thinking was least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections the the turing test was the first serious proposal the philosophy artificial intelligence symbolic reasoning and the logic theorist when access digital computers became possible the middle few scientists instinctively recognized that machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation symbols could well the essence human this was new approach creating thinking allen newell and future nobel herbert simon created the logic theorist with help from shaw the program would eventually prove the first theorems russell and whitehead principia mathematica and find new and more elegant proofs for simon said that they had solved the venerable mind body problem explaining how system composed matter can have the properties this was early statement the philosophical position john searle would later call strong that machines can contain minds just human bodies dartmouth conference the birth the dartmouth conference was organized marvin minsky john mccarthy and two senior claude shannon and nathan rochester ibm the proposal for the conference included this every aspect learning any other feature intelligence can precisely described that machine can made simulate the participants included ray solomonoff oliver selfridge trenchard more arthur samuel allen newell and herbert simon all whom would create important programs during the first decades the conference newell and simon debuted the logic theorist and mccarthy persuaded the attendees accept artificial the name the the dartmouth conference was the moment that gained its its its first success and its major and widely considered the birth the golden years the years after the dartmouth conference were era sprinting across new the programs that were developed during this time most simply astonishing computers were solving algebra word proving theorems geometry and learning speak few the time would have believed that such intelligent behavior machines was possible researchers expressed intense optimism private and predicting that fully intelligent machine would built less than years government agencies like arpa poured money into the new the work there were many successful programs and new directions the late and among the most influential were reasoning search many early programs used the same basic algorithm achieve some goal like winning game proving they proceeded step step towards making move searching through backtracking whenever they reached dead this paradigm was called reasoning search the principal difficulty was for many the number possible paths through the maze was simply astronomical situation known combinatorial explosion researchers would reduce the search space using heuristics rules that would eliminate those paths that were unlikely lead newell and simon tried capture general version this algorithm program called the general problem solver other searching programs were able accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems geometry and such herbert gelernter geometry theorem prover and saint written minsky student james slagle other programs searched through goals and subgoals plan like the strips system developed stanford control the behavior their robot shakey natural language important goal research allow computers communicate natural languages like early success was daniel bobrow program student which could solve high school algebra word semantic net represents concepts house door nodes and relations among concepts links between the the first program use semantic net was written ross quillian and the most successful and version was roger schank conceptual dependency theory joseph weizenbaum eliza could carry out conversations that were realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with human being and not but eliza had idea what she was talking she simply gave canned response repeated back what was said rephrasing her response with few grammar eliza was the first chatterbot micro worlds the late marvin minsky and seymour papert the mit laboratory proposed that research should focus artificially simple situations known they pointed out that successful sciences like basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes perfectly rigid much the research focused blocks world which consists colored blocks various shapes and sizes arrayed flat this paradigm led innovative work machine vision gerald sussman who led the adolfo guzman david waltz who invented constraint propagation and especially patrick winston the same minsky and papert built robot arm that could stack bringing the blocks world the crowning achievement the world program was terry winograd shrdlu could communicate ordinary english plan operations and execute the optimism the first generation researchers made these predictions about their simon and allen newell within ten years digital computer will the chess and within ten years digital computer will discover and prove important new mathematical simon machines will within twenty doing any work man can marvin minsky within generation the problem creating artificial will substantially marvin minsky life magazine from three eight years will have machine with the general intelligence average human the money june mit received million grant from the newly created advanced research projects agency later known darpa the money was used fund project mac which subsumed the founded minsky and mccarthy five years arpa continued provide three million dollars year until the arpa made similar grants newell and simon program cmu and the stanford project founded john mccarthy another important laboratory was established edinburgh university donald michie these four institutions would continue the main centers research and academia for many the money was proffered with few strings licklider then the director arpa believed that his organization should fund not and allowed researchers pursue whatever directions might interest this created freewheeling atmosphere mit that gave birth the hacker culture but this hands approach would not the first winter the was subject critiques and financial researchers had failed appreciate the difficulty the problems they their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly and when the promised results failed funding for the same the field connectionism neural nets was shut down almost completely for years marvin minsky devastating criticism perceptrons despite the difficulties with public perception the late new ideas were explored logic programming commonsense reasoning and many other the problems the early the capabilities programs were even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions the problems they were supposed all the programs some toys researchers had begun run into several fundamental limits that could not overcome the although some these limits would conquered later others still stymie the field this limited computer power there was not enough memory processing speed accomplish anything truly for ross quillian successful work natural language was demonstrated with vocabulary only twenty words because that was all that would fit hans moravec argued that computers were still millions times too weak exhibit suggested artificial intelligence requires computer power the same way that aircraft require horsepower below certain but power increases eventually could become with regard computer moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities human retina real time would require purpose computer capable operations second mips practical computer vision applications require mips the fastest supercomputer cray retailing million million was only capable around mips and typical desktop computer the time achieved less than mips intractability and the combinatorial explosion richard karp building stephen cook theorem showed there are many problems that can probably only solved exponential time the size the finding optimal solutions these problems requires unimaginable amounts computer time except when the problems are this almost certainly meant that many the toy solutions used would probably never scale into useful commonsense knowledge and reasoning many important artificial intelligence applications like vision natural language require simply enormous amounts information about the the program needs have some idea what might looking what talking this requires that the program know most the same things about the world that child researchers soon discovered that this was truly vast amount one could build database large and one knew how program might learn much moravec paradox proving theorems and solving geometry problems comparatively easy for but supposedly simple task like recognizing face crossing room without bumping into anything extremely this helps explain why research into vision and robotics had made little progress the middle the frame and qualification problems researchers like john mccarthy who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning default reasoning without making changes the structure logic they developed new logics like non monotonic logics and modal logics try solve the the end funding winter the agencies which funded research such the british government darpa and nrc became frustrated with the lack progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into the pattern began early when the alpac report appeared criticizing machine translation after spending million the nrc ended all the lighthill report the state research england criticized the utter failure achieve its grandiose and led the dismantling research that the report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem reason for darpa was deeply disappointed with researchers working the speech understanding research program cmu and canceled annual grant three million funding for projects was hard hans moravec blamed the crisis the unrealistic predictions his many researchers were caught web increasing however there was another since the passage the mansfield amendment darpa had been under increasing pressure fund oriented direct rather than basic undirected funding for the freewheeling exploration that had gone the would not come from darpa instead the money was directed specific projects with clear such autonomous tanks and battle management critiques from across campus philosophy artificial intelligence several philosophers had strong objections the claims being made one the earliest was john lucas who argued that incompleteness theorem showed that formal system such computer could never see the truth certain while human being hubert dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises the and critiqued the assumptions arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little symbol and great deal embodied instinctive unconscious know how john searle chinese room argument presented attempted show that program could not said understand the symbols that uses quality called intentionality the symbols have meaning for the searle then the machine can not described thinking these critiques were not taken seriously often because they seemed far off the problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and was unclear what difference know how intentionality made actual computer minsky said dreyfus and searle they and should dreyfus who taught mit was given cold later said that researchers dared not seen having lunch with joseph weizenbaum the author eliza felt his treatment dreyfus was unprofessional and although was outspoken critic positions deliberately made plain that theirs was not the way treat human weizenbaum began have serious ethical doubts about when kenneth colby wrote doctor chatterbot therapist weizenbaum was disturbed that colby saw his mindless program serious therapeutic feud and the situation was not helped when colby did not credit weizenbaum for his contribution the weizenbaum published computer power and human reason which argued that the misuse artificial intelligence has the potential devalue human perceptrons and the dark age connectionism perceptron was form neural network introduced frank rosenblatt who had been schoolmate marvin minsky the bronx high school science like most was optimistic about their predicting that perceptron may eventually able make and translate active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the but came sudden halt with the publication minsky and papert book perceptrons suggested that there were severe limitations what perceptrons could and that frank rosenblatt predictions had been grossly the effect the book was virtually research all was done connectionism for years eventually new generation researchers would revive the field and thereafter would become vital and useful part artificial rosenblatt would not live see died boating accident shortly after the book was the logic prolog and expert systems logic was introduced into research early john mccarthy his advice taker proposal alan robinson had discovered simple method implement deduction the resolution and unification algorithm however straightforward like those attempted mccarthy and his students the late were especially the programs required astronomical numbers steps prove simple more fruitful approach logic was developed the robert kowalski the university edinburgh and soon this led the collaboration with french researchers alain colmerauer and philippe roussel who created the successful logic programming language prolog prolog uses subset logic horn clauses closely related rules and production rules that permit tractable rules would continue providing foundation for edward feigenbaum expert systems and the continuing work allen newell and herbert simon that would lead soar and their unified theories cognition critics the logical approach dreyfus had that human beings rarely used logic when they solved experiments psychologists like peter wason eleanor rosch amos tversky daniel kahneman and others provided mccarthy responded that what people argued that what really needed are machines that can solve not machines that think people the frames and scripts among the critics mccarthy approach were his colleagues across the country mit marvin minsky seymour papert and roger schank were trying solve problems like story and object that required machine think like order use ordinary concepts like chair restaurant they had make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally unfortunately imprecise concepts like these are hard represent gerald sussman observed that using precise language describe essentially imprecise concepts make them any more schank described their approaches scruffy opposed the neat paradigms used mccarthy kowalski feigenbaum newell and simon seminal minsky noted that many his fellow scruffy researchers were using the same kind framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about for use the concept there constellation facts that immediately come might assume that eats worms and know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not logical but these structured sets assumptions are part the context everything say and called these structures frames schank used version frames called scripts successfully answer questions about short stories many years later object oriented programming would adopt the essential idea inheritance from research boom the form program called expert systems was adopted corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus mainstream those same the japanese government aggressively funded with its fifth generation computer project another encouraging event the early was the revival connectionism the work john hopfield and david rumelhart once had achieved the rise expert systems expert system program that answers questions solves problems about specific domain using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge the earliest examples were developed edward feigenbaum and his dendral begun identified compounds from spectrometer mycin developed diagnosed infectious blood they demonstrated the feasibility the expert systems restricted themselves small domain specific knowledge thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem and their simple design made relatively easy for programs built and then modified once they were all the programs proved useful something that had not been able achieve this expert system called xcon was completed cmu for the digital equipment corporation was enormous was saving the company million dollars annually corporations around the world began develop and deploy expert systems and they were spending over billion dollars most house industry grew support including hardware companies like symbolics and lisp machines and software companies such intellicorp and aion the knowledge revolution the power expert systems came from the expert knowledge they they were part new direction research that had been gaining ground throughout the researchers were beginning for violated the scientific canon that intelligence might very well based the ability use large amounts diverse knowledge different writes pamela mccorduck great lesson from the was that intelligent behavior depended very much dealing with sometimes quite detailed domain where given task knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became major focus research the the also saw the birth cyc the first attempt attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly creating massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person douglas lenat who started and led the argued that there shortcut the only way for machines know the meaning human concepts teach one concept the project was not expected completed for many the money the fifth generation project the japanese ministry international trade and industry set aside million for the fifth generation computer project their objectives were write programs and build machines that could carry translate interpret and reason like human much the chagrin scruffies they chose prolog the primary computer language for the other countries responded with new programs their the began the million alvey project consortium american companies formed the microelectronics and computer technology corporation mcc fund large scale projects and information darpa responded founding the strategic computing initiative and tripling its investment between and the revival connectionism physicist john hopfield was able prove that form neural network now called hopfield net could learn and process information completely new around the same david rumelhart popularized new method for training neural networks called backpropagation discovered years earlier paul werbos these two discoveries revived the field connectionism which had been largely abandoned since the new field was unified and inspired the appearance parallel distributed processing two volume collection papers edited rumelhart and psychologist james mcclelland neural networks would become commercially successful the when they began used the engines driving programs like optical character recognition and speech recognition bust the second winter the business fascination with rose and fell the the classic pattern economic bubble the collapse was the perception government agencies and investors the field continued make advances despite the rodney brooks and hans moravec researchers from the related field robotics argued for entirely new approach artificial winter the term winter was coined researchers who had survived the funding cuts when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out control and that disappointment would certainly their fears were well the late and early suffered series financial the first indication change weather was the sudden collapse the market for specialized hardware desktop computers from apple and ibm had been steadily gaining speed and power and they became more powerful than the more expensive lisp machines made symbolics and there was longer good reason buy entire industry worth half billion dollars was demolished eventually the earliest successful expert such xcon proved too expensive they were difficult they could not they were brittle they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual and they fell prey problems such the qualification problem that had been identified years expert systems proved but only few special the late the strategic computing initiative cut funding deeply and new leadership darpa had decided that was not the next and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely produce immediate the impressive list goals penned for fifth generation project had not been indeed some like carry casual had not been met with other expectations had run much higher than what was actually the importance having nouvelle and embodied reason nouvelle based situated embodied cognitive science the late several researchers advocated completely new approach artificial based they believed show real machine needs have body needs move survive and deal with the they argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting important human skill see moravec paradox they advocated building intelligence from the bottom the approach revived ideas from cybernetics and control theory that had been unpopular since the another precursor was david marr who had come mit the late from successful background theoretical neuroscience lead the group studying vision rejected all symbolic approaches both mccarthy logic and minsky arguing that needed understand the physical machinery vision from the bottom before any symbolic processing took work would cut short leukemia paper elephants play chess robotics researcher rodney brooks took direct aim the physical symbol system hypothesis arguing that symbols are not always necessary since the world its own best always exactly always has every detail there the trick sense appropriately and often the and many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model the mind and argued that the body was essential for theory called the embodied mind thesis present the field now more than half century finally achieved some its oldest began used successfully throughout the technology although somewhat behind the some the success was due increasing computer power and some was achieved focusing specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards scientific still the reputation the business world was less than inside the field there was little agreement the reasons for failure fulfill the dream human level intelligence that had captured the imagination the world the together all these factors helped fragment into competing subfields focused particular problems sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree artificial was both more cautious and more successful than had ever milestones and law may deep blue became the first computer playing system beat reigning world chess garry kasparov stanford robot won the darpa grand challenge driving autonomously for miles along unrehearsed desert two years team from cmu won the darpa urban challenge autonomously navigating miles urban environment while adhering traffic hazards and all traffic february jeopardy quiz show exhibition ibm question answering system watson defeated the two greatest champions brad rutter and ken jennings significant these successes were not due some revolutionary new but mostly the tedious application engineering skill and the tremendous power computers deep computer was million times faster than the ferranti mark that christopher strachey taught play chess this dramatic increase measured moore law which predicts that the speed and memory capacity computers doubles every two the fundamental problem raw computer was slowly being intelligent agents new paradigm called intelligent agents became widely accepted during the although earlier researchers had proposed modular divide and approaches the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until judea pearl allen newell and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study when the economist definition rational agent was married computer science definition object module the intelligent agent paradigm was intelligent agent system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances this simple programs that solve specific problems are intelligent are human beings and organizations human such firms the intelligent agent paradigm defines research the study intelligent this generalization some earlier definitions goes beyond studying human studies all kinds the paradigm gave researchers license study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and provided common language describe problems and share their solutions with each and with other fields that also used concepts abstract like economics and control theory was hoped that complete agent architecture like newell soar would one day allow researchers build more versatile and intelligent systems out interacting intelligent agents victory the researchers began develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had the there was widespread realization that many the problems that needed solve were already being worked researchers fields like mathematics economics operations research the shared mathematical language allowed both higher level collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement results which were measurable and had become more rigorous scientific discipline russell norvig describe this nothing less than revolution and the victory the neats judea pearl highly influential book brought probability and decision theory into among the many new tools use were bayesian networks hidden markov models information theory stochastic modeling and classical optimization precise mathematical descriptions were also developed for computational intelligence paradigms like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms behind the scenes algorithms originally developed researchers began appear parts larger had solved lot very difficult problems and their solutions proved useful throughout the technology such data mining industrial robotics logistics speech recognition banking medical diagnosis and google search the field receives little credit for these many greatest innovations have been reduced the status just another item the tool chest computer nick bostrom explains lot cutting edge has filtered into general often without being called because once something becomes useful enough and common enough not labeled many researchers deliberately called their work other such informatics knowledge based systems cognitive systems computational intelligence this may because they considered their field fundamentally different from but also the new names help procure the commercial world the failed promises the winter continue haunt the new york times reported computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear being viewed eyed where hal arthur clarke and stanley kubrick had imagined that the year machine would exist with intelligence that matched exceeded the capability human the character they hal was based belief shared many leading researchers that such machine would exist the year marvin minsky asks the question why get hal minsky believes that the answer that the central like commonsense reasoning were being while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications neural nets genetic algorithms john mccarthy the other still blames the qualification problem for ray kurzweil the issue computer power using moore law predicts that machines with level intelligence will appear jeff hawkins argues that neural net research ignores the essential properties the human cortex
