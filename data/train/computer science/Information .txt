computer science	information navigation search information ascii wikipedia binary information that which that from which data can information conveyed either the content message through direct indirect observation some thing that which perceived can construed message its own and that information always conveyed the content message information can encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation for information may encoded into signs and transmitted via signals thermodynamics information any kind event that affects the state dynamic system that can interpret the information resolves uncertainty the uncertainty event measured its probability occurrence and inversely proportional the more uncertain the more information required resolve uncertainty that the bit typical unit information but other units such the nat may example information one fair coin log bit and two fair coin flips log bits the concept that information the message has different meanings different thus the concept information becomes closely related notions constraint communication control data form disambiguation needed instruction knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception

information records semiotics see also references further reading external links etymology history the word and concept information the english word was apparently derived from the latin stem information the nominative informatio this noun derived from the verb informare the sense give form the instruct teach inform itself comes via french informer from the latin verb informare which means give form idea furthermore latin itself already contained the word informatio meaning concept but the extent which this may have influenced the development the word information english not the ancient greek word for form was morphe morph and also eidos idea shape set the latter word was famously used technical philosophical sense plato and later aristotle denote the ideal identity essence something see theory forms eidos can also associated with proposition even the ancient greek word for information which transliterates rophoria from fully and phorein frequentative pherein literally means fully conveys modern greek language the word still daily use and has the same meaning the word information unfortunately biblical scholars have translated rophoria into full creating connotative meaning the addition its primary the word symbol has deep roots semiotic triangle this regard can interpreted communicate information the one decoding that specific type sign this something that occurs frequently with the etymology many words ancient and modern greek language where there very strong denotative relationship between the the word symbol that conveys specific encoded and the concept whose meaning the interpretant attempts information theory approach from the stance information theory information taken sequence symbols from say input alphabet and output alphabet information processing consists output function that maps any input sequence from into output sequence from the mapping may probabilistic may have memory sensory input often information can viewed type input organism system inputs are two some inputs are important the function the organism for food system energy his book sensory ecology dusenbery called these causal other inputs are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can used predict the occurrence causal input later time and perhaps another some information important because association with other information but eventually there must connection causal information usually carried weak stimuli that must detected specialized sensory systems and amplified energy inputs before they can functional the organism for light often causal input plants but provides information the colored light reflected from flower too weak much photosynthetic work but the visual system the bee detects and the nervous system uses the information guide the bee the where the bee often finds nectar which are causal serving nutritional representation and complexity the cognitive scientist and applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues that information concept that involves least two related entities order make quantitative these any dimensionally defined category objects and any its subsets representation other conveys representational and conceptual information about vigo then defines the amount information that conveys about the rate change the complexity whenever the objects are removed from under vigo pattern invariance complexity representation and five fundamental constructs universal are unified under novel mathematical among other the framework aims overcome the limitations weaver information when attempting characterize and measure subjective influence which leads transformation information any type pattern that influences the formation transformation other this there need for conscious mind much less the citation needed consider for dna the sequence nucleotides pattern that influences the formation and development organism without any need for conscious systems theory times seems refer information this assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious and patterns circulating due feedback the system can called other can said that information this sense something potentially perceived though not created presented for that for gregory bateson defines information difference that makes however the premise influence implies that information has been perceived conscious mind and also interpreted the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation the information into knowledge complex definitions both information and knowledge make such semantic and logical analysis but the condition transformation important point the study information relates especially the business discipline knowledge management this tools and processes are used assist knowledge worker performing research and making including steps such reviewing information order effectively derive value and meaning referencing metadata any available establishing relevant context often selecting from many possible contexts deriving new knowledge from the information making decisions recommendations from the resulting stewart argues that the transformation information into knowledge critical lying the core value creation and competitive advantage for the modern the danish dictionary information terms argues that information only provides answer posed whether the answer provides knowledge depends the informed generalized definition the concept should information answer specific when marshall mcluhan speaks media and their effects human refers the structure artifacts that turn shape our behaviors and also pheromones are often said information this property physics physical information information has defined meaning bekenstein claimed that growing trend physics was define the physical world being made information itself and thus information defined this see digital physics examples this include the phenomenon quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference their separation the speed information itself cannot travel faster than light even the information transmitted this could lead all attempts physically observing particle with entangled relationship another being slowed even though the particles are not connected any other way other than the information they another link demonstrated the maxwell demon thought this direct relationship between information and another physical entropy consequence that impossible destroy information without increasing the entropy practical terms this often means generating another more philosophical outcome that information could thought interchangeable with energy citation needed thus the study logic gates the theoretical lower bound thermal energy released and gate higher than for the not gate because information destroyed and gate and simply converted not gate physical information particular importance the theory quantum computers technologically mediated information estimated that the technological capacity store information grew from optimally exabytes which the informational equivalent less than one rom per person per optimally exabytes this the informational equivalent almost rom per person the combined technological capacity receive information through way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent newspapers per person per day the combined effective

accountability due compliance meeting statutory and common law and security personal and corporate semiotics beynon davies explains the faceted concept information terms signs and sign signs themselves can considered terms four dependent layers branches semiotics pragmatics semantics syntax and these four layers serve connect the social world the one hand with the physical technical world the pragmatics concerned with the purpose pragmatics links the issue signs with the context within which signs are the focus pragmatics the intentions living agents underlying communicative other pragmatics link language semantics concerned with the meaning message conveyed communicative semantics considers the content semantics the study the meaning signs the association between signs and semantics can considered the study the link between symbols and their referents concepts particularly the way which signs relate human syntax concerned with the formalism used represent syntax area studies the form communication terms the logic and grammar sign syntax devoted the study the form rather than the content signs and empirics the study the signals used carry the physical characteristics the medium empirics devoted the study communication channels and their sound light electronic transmission nielsen discusses the relationship between semiotics and information relation the concept lexicographic information costs introduced and refers the efforts users dictionaries need make order first find the data sought secondly understand the data that they can generate communication normally exists within the context some social the social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed and the form which communication takes communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages which comprise collections related signs taken from language which mutually understood the agents involved the mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language terms its agreed syntax and the sender codes the message the language and sends the message signals along some communication channel the chosen communication channel will have inherent properties which determine outcomes such the speed with which communication can take place and over what see also abstraction accuracy and precision classified information
