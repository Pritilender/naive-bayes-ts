other measures timeline awards the field see also references external links overview information retrieval process begins when user enters query into the queries are formal statements information needs for example search strings web search information retrieval query does not uniquely identify single object the instead several objects may match the perhaps with different degrees relevancy object entity that represented information database user queries are matched against the database depending the application the data objects may for text images audio mind maps often the documents themselves are not kept stored directly the but are instead represented the system document surrogates most systems compute numeric score how well each object the database matches the and rank the objects according this the top ranking objects are then shown the the process may then iterated the user wishes refine the history seward bram stoker dracula the idea using computers search for relevant pieces information was popularized the article may think vannevar bush the first automated information retrieval systems were introduced the and several different techniques had been shown perform well small text corpora such the cranfield collection several thousand large scale retrieval such the lockheed dialog came into use early the the department defense along with the national institute standards and technology cosponsored the text retrieval conference part the tipster text the aim this was look into the information retrieval community supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation text retrieval methodologies very large text this catalyzed research methods that scale huge the introduction web search engines has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even model types german entry dominik kuropka for effectively retrieving relevant documents the documents are typically transformed into suitable each retrieval strategy incorporate specific model for its document representation the picture the right illustrates the relationship some common the the models are categorized according two the mathematical basis and the properties the first mathematical basis set theoretic models represent documents sets words similarities are usually derived from theoretic operations those common models standard boolean model extended boolean model fuzzy retrieval algebraic models represent documents and queries usually matrices the similarity the query vector and document vector represented scalar vector space model generalized vector space model topic based vector space model extended boolean model latent semantic indexing aka latent semantic analysis probabilistic models treat the process document retrieval probabilistic similarities are computed probabilities that document relevant for given probabilistic theorems like the bayes theorem are often used these binary independence model probabilistic relevance model which based the okapi relevance function uncertain inference language models randomness model latent dirichlet allocation based retrieval models view documents vectors values feature functions just features and seek the best way combine these features into single relevance typically learning rank methods feature functions are arbitrary functions document and and such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model just yet another second properties the model models without interdependencies treat different words this fact usually represented vector space models the orthogonality assumption term vectors probabilistic models independency assumption for term models with immanent term interdependencies allow representation interdependencies between however the degree the interdependency between two terms defined the model usually directly indirectly derived dimensional reduction from the occurrence those terms the whole set models with transcendent term interdependencies allow representation interdependencies between but they not allege how the interdependency between two terms they relay external source for the degree interdependency between two for example human sophisticated performance and correctness measures precision and recall many different measures for evaluating the performance information retrieval systems have been the measures require collection documents and all common measures described here assume ground truth notion every document known either relevant relevant particular practice queries may ill posed and there may different shades precision precision the fraction the documents retrieved that are relevant the information binary classification precision analogous positive predictive value precision takes all retrieved documents into can also evaluated given off considering only the topmost results returned the this measure called precision note that the meaning and usage precision the field information retrieval differs from the definition accuracy and precision within other branches science and statistics recall recall the fraction the documents that are relevant the query that are successfully binary recall often called sensitivity can looked the probability that relevant document retrieved the query trivial achieve recall returning all documents response any therefore recall alone not enough but one needs measure the number relevant documents for example computing the fall out the proportion relevant documents that are out all relevant documents binary fall out closely related specificity and equal can looked the probability that relevant document retrieved the query trivial achieve out returning zero documents response any measure score the weighted harmonic mean precision and the traditional measure balanced score this also known the measure because recall and precision are evenly the general formula for negative real two other commonly used measures are the measure which weights recall twice much and the measure which weights precision twice much the measure was derived van rijsbergen that measures the effectiveness retrieval with respect user who attaches times much importance recall based van effectiveness measure their relationship where average precision precision and recall are value metrics based the whole list documents returned the for systems that return ranked sequence desirable also consider the order which the returned documents are computing precision and recall every position the ranked sequence one can plot recall plotting precision function recall average precision computes the average value over the interval from that the area under the recall this integral practice replaced with finite sum over every position the ranked sequence where the rank the sequence retrieved the number retrieved the precision off the and the change recall from items this finite sum equivalent where indicator function equaling the item rank relevant zero note that the average over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get precision score some authors choose interpolate the function reduce the impact wiggles the for the pascal visual object classes challenge benchmark for computer vision object computes average precision averaging the precision over set evenly spaced recall levels where interpolated precision that takes the maximum precision over all recalls greater than alternative derive analytical function assuming particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision for binormal recall curve can obtained assuming decision values both classes follow gaussian precision precision position the ranking results for query that has relevant this measure highly correlated average also precision equal recall the mean average precision mean average precision for set queries the mean the average precision scores for each where the number discounted cumulative gain discounted cumulative gain dcg uses graded relevance scale documents from the result set evaluate the document based its position the result the premise dcg that highly relevant documents appearing lower search result list should penalized the graded relevance value reduced logarithmically proportional the position the the dcg accumulated particular rank position defined since result set may vary size among different queries compare performances the normalised version dcg uses ideal this sorts documents result list producing ideal dcg position which normalizes the the ndcg values for all queries can averaged obtain measure the average performance ranking note that perfect ranking the will the same the producing ndcg all ndcg calculations are then relative values the interval and are query other measures mean
