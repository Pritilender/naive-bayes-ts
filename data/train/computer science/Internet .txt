telephone interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability call receive call from traditional telephone simple inexpensive voip network adapters are available that eliminate the need for personal voice quality can still vary from call but often equal and can even exceed that traditional remaining problems for voip include emergency telephone number dialing and currently few voip providers provide emergency but not universally older traditional phones with extra may powered only and operate during power voip can never without backup power source for the phone
