computer science	knowledge representation and reasoning knowledge representation navigation search knowledge representation and reasoning the field artificial intelligence devoted representing information about the world form that computer system can utilize solve complex tasks such diagnosing medical condition having dialog natural language knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge order design formalisms that will make complex systems easier design and knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic automate various kinds reasoning such the application rules the relations sets and subsets examples knowledge representation formalisms include semantic nets frames rules and ontologies examples automated reasoning engines include inference theorem and contents history overview characteristics ontology engineering commitment begins with the earliest choices commitments accumulate layers see also references further reading external links history classic example how setting appropriate formalism leads new solutions the early example the adoption arabic over roman arabic numerals facilitate larger and more complex algebraic thus influencing future knowledge knowledge representation incorporates theories from psychology which look understand how humans solve problems and represent early psychology researchers did not believe semantic basis for for the psychological school radical behaviorism which dominated universities from the the explicitly ruled out internal states legitimate areas for scientific study legitimate causal contributors human later theories semantics support based construction the earliest work computerized knowledge representation was focused general problem solvers such the general problem solver system developed allen newell and herbert simon these systems featured data structures for planning and the system would begin with would then decompose that goal into goals and then set out construct strategies that could accomplish each these early days general search algorithms such were also however the amorphous problem definitions for systems such gps meant that they worked only for very constrained toy domains the blocks world order tackle toy researchers such feigenbaum and frederick roth realized that was necessary focus systems more constrained was the failure these efforts that led the cognitive revolution psychology and the phase focused knowledge representation that resulted expert systems the and production systems frame languages etc rather than general problem changed its focus expert systems that could match human competence specific such medical expert systems gave the terminology still use today where systems are divided into knowledge base with facts about the world and rules and inference engine that applies the rules the knowledge base order answer questions and solve these early systems the knowledge base tended fairly flat essentially assertions about the values variables used the addition expert other researchers developed the concept frame based languages the mid frame similar object abstract description category describing things the problems and potential frames were originally used systems geared toward human understanding natural language and the social settings which various default expectations such ordering food restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system choose appropriate responses dynamic long before the frame communities and the based researchers realized that there was synergy between their frames were good for representing the real described subclasses slots data with various constraints possible rules were good for representing and utilizing complex logic such the process make medical integrated systems were developed that combined frames and one the most powerful and well known was the knowledge engineering environment from intellicorp kee had complete rule engine with forward and backward chaining also had complete frame based knowledge base with slots data inheritance and message although message passing originated the oriented community rather than was quickly embraced researchers well environments such kee and the operating systems for lisp machines from symbolics xerox and texas instruments the integration rules and oriented programming was significantly driven commercial ventures such kee and symbolics spun off from various research the same time this was there was another strain research which was less commercially focused and was driven mathematical logic and automated theorem one the most influential languages this research was the one language the mid one was frame language that had rigorous formal definitions for concepts such relation one and languages that were influenced such loom had automated reasoning engine that was based formal logic rather than then this reasoner called the classifier can analyze set declarations and infer new for redefine class subclass superclass some other class that formally this way the classifier can function inference deducing new facts from existing knowledge the classifier can also provide consistency checking knowledge base which the case one languages also referred another area knowledge representation research was the problem common sense one the first realizations from trying make software that can function with human natural language was that humans regularly draw extensive foundation knowledge about the real world that simply take for granted but that not all obvious artificial basic principles common sense causality intentions etc example the frame problem that event driven logic there need axioms that state things maintain position from one moment the next unless they are moved some external order make true artificial intelligence agent that can converse with humans using natural language and can process basic statements and questions about the world essential represent this kind one the most ambitious programs tackle this problem was doug cyc project cyc established its own frame language and had large numbers analysts document various areas common sense reasoning that the knowledge recorded cyc included common sense models causality physics intentions and many the starting point for knowledge representation the knowledge representation hypothesis first formalized brian smith any mechanically embodied intelligent process will comprised structural ingredients that external observers naturally take represent propositional account the knowledge that the overall process and independent such external semantic play formal but causal and essential role engendering the behavior that manifests that currently one the most active areas knowledge representation research are projects associated with the semantic web the semantic web seeks add layer semantics top the current rather than indexing web sites and pages via the semantic web creates large ontologies searching for concept will more effective than traditional text only frame languages and automatic classification play big part the vision for the future semantic the automatic classification gives developers technology provide order constantly evolving network defining ontologies that are static and incapable evolving the fly would very limiting for internet based the classifier technology provides the ability deal with the dynamic environment the recent projects funded primarily the defense advanced research projects agency have integrated frame languages and classifiers with markup languages based the resource description framework provides the basic capability define subclasses and properties the web ontology language provides additional levels semantics and enables integration with classification overview knowledge representation the field artificial intelligence that focuses designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can used solve complex the justification for knowledge representation that conventional procedural code not the best formalism use solve complex knowledge representation makes complex software easier define and maintain than procedural code and can used expert systems for talking experts terms business rules rather than code lessens the semantic gap between users and developers and makes development complex systems more knowledge representation goes hand hand with automated reasoning because one the main purposes explicitly representing knowledge able reason about that make assert new etc virtually all knowledge representation languages have reasoning inference engine part the key off the design knowledge representation formalism that between expressivity and the ultimate knowledge representation formalism terms expressive power and compactness first order logic there more powerful formalism than that used mathematicians define general propositions about the however fol has two drawbacks knowledge representation ease use and practicality first order logic can intimidating even for many software languages which not have the complete formal power fol can still provide close the same expressive power with user interface that more practical for the average developer the issue practicality implementation that fol some ways too with fol possible create statements quantification over infinite that would cause system never terminate attempted verify thus subset fol can both easier use and more practical this was driving motivation behind based expert then rules provide subset fol but very useful one that also very the history most the early knowledge representation from databases semantic nets theorem provers and production systems can viewed various design decisions whether emphasize expressive power computability and key paper the randall davis mit outlined five distinct roles analyze knowledge representation knowledge representation most fundamentally substitute for the thing used enable entity determine consequences thinking rather than reasoning about the world rather than taking action set ontological answer the what terms should think about the fragmentary theory intelligent expressed terms three the fundamental conception intelligent the set inferences the representation and the set inferences medium for pragmatically efficient the computational environment which thinking one contribution this pragmatic efficiency supplied the guidance representation provides for organizing information facilitate making the recommended medium human language which say things about the knowledge representation and reasoning are key enabling technology for the semantic web languages based the frame model with automatic classification provide layer semantics top the existing rather than searching via text strings typical today will possible define logical queries and find pages that map those the automated reasoning component these systems engine known the classifiers focus the subsumption relations knowledge base rather than classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology new information becomes this capability ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space the the semantic web integrates concepts from knowledge representation and reasoning with markup languages based the resource description framework provides the basic capabilities define based objects the internet with basic features such relations and object the web ontology language adds additional semantics and integrates with automatic classification characteristics ron brachman categorizes the core issues for knowledge representation primitives what the underlying framework used represent semantic networks were one the first knowledge representation also data structures and algorithms for general fast this area there strong overlap with research data structures and algorithms computer early systems the lisp programming language which was modeled after the lambda calculus was often used form functional knowledge frames and rules were the next kind frame languages had various mechanisms for expressing and enforcing constraints frame all data frames are stored slots are analogous relations relation modeling and object properties oriented another technique for primitives define languages that are modeled after first order the most well known example prolog but there are also many special purpose theorem proving these environments can validate logical models and can deduce new theories from existing essentially they automate the process logician would through analyzing theorem proving technology had some specific practical applications the areas software for example possible prove that software program rigidly adheres formal logical meta this also known the issue reflection computer refers the capability formalism have access information about its own example would the object protocol smalltalk and clos that gives developers run time access the class objects and enables them dynamically redefine the structure the knowledge base even run meta representation means the knowledge representation language itself expressed that for most frame based environments all frames would instances frame that class object can inspected run time that the object can understand and even change its internal structure the structure other parts the based environments the rules were also usually instances rule part the meta protocol for rules were the meta rules that prioritized rule incompleteness traditional logic requires additional axioms and constraints deal with the real world opposed the world also often useful associate degrees confidence with not simply say socrates but rather socrates human with confidence this was one the early innovations from expert systems research which migrated some commercial the ability associate certainty factors with rules and later research this area known fuzzy definitions and universals facts and universals are general statements about the world such all humans are facts are specific examples universals such socrates human and therefore logical terms definitions and universals are about universal quantification while facts and defaults are about existential all forms knowledge representation must deal with this aspect and most with some variant set modeling universals sets and subsets and definitions elements those non monotonic non monotonic reasoning allows various kinds hypothetical the system associates facts asserted with the rules and facts used justify them and those facts change updates the dependent knowledge rule based systems this capability known truth maintenance expressive the standard that brachman and most researchers use measure expressive adequacy usually first order logic theoretical limitations mean that full implementation fol not researchers should clear about how expressive how much full fol expressive they intend their representation reasoning this refers the run time efficiency the the ability the knowledge base updated and the reasoner develop new inferences reasonable period some ways this the flip side expressive general the more powerful the more has expressive the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will efficiency was often especially for early applications knowledge representation they were usually implemented interpreted environments such lisp which were slow compared more traditional platforms the ontology engineering ontology engineering ontology language the early years based systems the bases were fairly the bases that were meant actually solve real problems rather than proof concept demonstrations needed focus well defined for not just medical diagnosis whole topic but medical diagnosis certain kinds based technology scaled the need for larger knowledge bases and for modular knowledge bases that could communicate and integrate with each other became this gave rise the discipline ontology designing and building large knowledge bases that could used multiple one the leading research projects this area was the cyc cyc was attempt build huge encyclopedic knowledge base that would contain not just expert knowledge but common sense designing artificial intelligence agent was soon realized that representing common sense knowledge that humans simply take for was essential make that could interact with humans using natural cyc was meant address this the language they defined was known cycl after cycl number ontology languages have been most are declarative languages and are either frame languages are based first order logic modularity the ability define boundaries around specific domains and problem essential for these languages because stated tom every ontology social agreement among people with common motive there are always many competing and differing views that make any general purpose ontology general purpose ontology would have applicable any domain and different areas knowledge need there long history work attempting build ontologies for variety task ontology for the lumped element model widely used representing electronic circuits well ontologies for belief and even programming each these offers way see some part the the lumped element for suggests that think circuits terms components with connections between with signals flowing instantaneously along the this useful but not the only possible different ontology arises need attend the electrodynamics the here signals propagate finite speed and object like that was previously viewed single component with behavior may now have thought extended medium through which electromagnetic wave ontologies can course written down wide variety languages and notations logic lisp etc the essential information not the form that language but the the set concepts offered way thinking about the simply the important part notions like connections and not whether choose write them predicates lisp the commitment make selecting one another ontology can produce sharply different view the task consider the difference that arises selecting the lumped element view circuit rather than the electrodynamic view the same second medical diagnosis viewed terms rules mycin looks substantially different from the same task viewed terms frames internist where mycin sees the medical world made empirical associations connecting symptom internist sees set particular prototypical matched against the case commitment begins with the earliest choices the internist example also demonstrates that there significant and unavoidable ontological commitment even the level the familiar representation logic rules frames etc each embody viewpoint the kinds things that are important the logic for involves fairly commitment viewing the world terms individual entities and relations between rule based systems view the world terms value triples and the rules plausible inference that connect while frames have thinking terms prototypical each these thus supplies its own view what important attend and each conversely that anything not easily seen those terms may this course not guaranteed since anything ignored may later prove but the task hopeless every representation ignores something about the hence the best can start with good the existing representation technologies supply one set guesses about what attend and what selecting any them thus involves degree ontological the selection will have significant impact our perception and approach the and our perception the world being commitments accumulate layers the ontologic commitment representation thus begins the level the representation technologies and accumulates from additional layers commitment are made put the technology the use like structures internist offers illustrative the most fundamental the decision view diagnosis terms frames suggests thinking terms defaults and taxonomic but prototypes and how shall the taxonomy early description the system shows how these questions were answered the task supplying the second layer the prototypes are thus intended capture prototypical diseases classic and they will organized taxonomy indexed around organ this sensible and intuitive set choices but clearly not the only way apply frames the hence another layer ontological the third and this case layer this set choices which diseases will included and which branches the hierarchy will they ontologic questions that arise even this level can quite consider for example determining which the following are considered diseases abnormal states requiring alcoholism homosexuality and chronic fatigue the ontologic commitment here sufficiently obvious and sufficiently important that often subject debate the field quite independent building automated similar sorts decisions have made with all the representation because each them supplies only first order guess about how see the they offer way seeing but indicate how instantiate that frames suggest prototypes and taxonomies but not tell which things select rules suggest thinking terms plausible but tell which plausible inferences attend similarly logic tells view the world terms individuals and but does not specify which individuals and relations commitment particular view the world thus starts with the choice representation and accumulates subsequent choices are made about how see the world those see also commonsense knowledge base personal knowledge base based system
