explicitly tom mitchell provided widely more formal computer program said learn from experience with respect some class tasks and performance measure its performance tasks measured improves with experience this definition notable for its defining machine learning fundamentally operational rather than cognitive thus following alan turing proposal paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines replaced with the question can machines what thinking can generalization core objective learner generalize from its generalization this context the ability learning machine perform accurately unseen tasks after having experienced learning data the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative the space and the learner has build general model about this space that enables produce sufficiently accurate predictions new machine learning and data mining these two terms are commonly they often employ the same methods and overlap they can roughly defined machine learning focuses based known properties learned from the training data mining focuses the discovery unknown properties the this the analysis step knowledge discovery the two areas overlap many data mining uses many machine learning but often with slightly different goal the other machine learning also employs data mining methods unsupervised preprocessing step improve learner much the confusion between these two research communities which often have separate conferences and separate ecml pkdd being major comes from the basic assumptions they work machine performance usually evaluated with respect the ability reproduce known knowledge while knowledge discovery and data mining the key task the discovery previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect known uninformed method will easily outperformed supervised while typical kdd supervised methods cannot used due the unavailability training human interaction some machine learning systems attempt eliminate the need for human intuition data while others adopt collaborative approach between human and human intuition however entirely since the designer must specify how the data represented and what mechanisms will used search for characterization the citation needed algorithm types machine learning algorithms can organized into taxonomy based the desired outcome the algorithm the type input available during training the machine citation needed supervised learning algorithms are trained labelled examples input where the desired output the supervised learning algorithm attempts generalise function mapping from inputs outputs which can then used speculatively generate output for previously unseen unsupervised learning algorithms operate unlabelled examples input where the desired output here the objective discover structure the data through cluster analysis not generalise mapping from inputs semi supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabelled examples generate appropriate function transduction transductive inference tries predict new outputs specific and fixed cases from specific cases reinforcement learning concerned with intelligent ought maximise some notion the agent executes actions which cause the observable state the environment through sequence the agent attempts gather knowledge about how the environment responds its and attempts synthesise sequence actions that maximises cumulative learning learn learns its own inductive bias based previous developmental learning elaborated for robot learning generates its own sequences also called learning situations cumulatively acquire repertoires novel skills through autonomous exploration and social interaction with human and using guidance mechanisms such active maturation motor and machine learning algorithms can also grouped into generative models and discriminative models theory computational learning theory the computational analysis machine learning algorithms and their performance branch theoretical computer science known computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future learning theory usually does not yield guarantees the performance instead probabilistic bounds the performance are quite addition performance computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility computational learning computation considered feasible can done polynomial there are two kinds time complexity results positive results show that certain class functions can learned polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot learned polynomial there are many similarities between machine learning theory and statistical inference although they use different approaches list machine learning

classification and regression given set training each marked belonging one two svm training algorithm builds model that predicts whether new example falls into one category the clustering cluster analysis cluster analysis the assignment set observations into subsets called clusters that observations within the same cluster are similar according some predesignated criterion while observations drawn from different clusters are different clustering techniques make different assumptions the structure the often defined some similarity metric and evaluated for example internal compactness similarity between members the same and separation between different other methods are based estimated density and graph connectivity clustering method unsupervised learning and common technique for statistical data analysis bayesian networks bayesian network bayesian belief network directed acyclic graphical model probabilistic graphical model that represents set random variables and their conditional independencies via directed acyclic graph for bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and given the network can used compute the probabilities the presence various efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and reinforcement learning reinforcement learning reinforcement learning concerned with how agent ought take actions environment maximize some notion term reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt find policy that maps states the world the actions the agent ought take those reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem that correct output pairs are never nor optimal actions explicitly representation learning representation learning several learning mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim discovering better representations the inputs provided during classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt preserve the information their input but transform way that makes often processing step before performing classification allowing reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that manifold learning algorithms attempt under the constraint that the learned representation sparse coding algorithms attempt under the constraint that the learned representation sparse has many multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim learn dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional without reshaping them into vectors deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels hierarchy with more abstract features defined terms lower level has been argued that intelligent machine one that learns representation that disentangles the underlying factors variation that explain the observed similarity and metric learning similarity learning this the learning machine given pairs examples that are considered similar and pairs less similar then needs learn similarity function distance metric that can predict new objects are sometimes used recommendation systems sparse
