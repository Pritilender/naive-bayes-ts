arrangement the various elements links nodes etc computer network essentially the topological structure network and may depicted physically physical topology the placement the various components including device location and cable while logical topology illustrates how data flows within regardless its physical distances between physical transmission signal types may differ between two yet their topologies may example local area network any given node the lan has one more physical links other devices the graphically mapping these links results geometric shape that can used describe the physical topology the conversely mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology the contents topology point point bus star ring mesh tree advantages disadvantages hybrid daisy chain centralization decentralization see also references external links topology there are two basic categories network physical topologies and logical the shape the cabling layout used link devices called the physical topology the this refers the layout cabling the locations and the interconnections between the nodes and the the physical topology network determined the capabilities the network access devices and the level control fault tolerance and the cost associated with cabling telecommunications the logical topology the way that the signals act the network the way that the data passes through the network from one device the next without regard the physical interconnection the logical topology not necessarily the same its physical for the original twisted pair ethernet using repeater hubs was logical bus topology with physical star topology token ring logical ring but wired physical star from the media access unit the logical classification network topologies generally follows the same classifications those the physical classifications network topologies but describes the path that the data takes between nodes being used opposed the actual physical connections between the logical topologies are generally determined network protocols opposed being determined the physical layout wires and network devices the flow the electrical although many cases the paths that the electrical signals take between nodes may closely match the logical flow hence the convention using the terms logical topology and signal topology interchangeably logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and logical topologies are able dynamically reconfigured special types equipment such routers and the study network topology recognizes eight basic

network nodes graph theory complete graph switching broadcasting partially connected tree thumb tree network topology this section may confusing unclear readers june tree topology structure like tree real tree structure has root node intermediate nodes and root node the main head node the structure and the leaves are the last nodes which has further child this structure arranged the hierarchical any nodes can have any number the child but the tree topology practically impossible because the node the network that nothing but the computing device can have maximum one two cannot attach more than child nodes the computing parent there are many sub structures under tree but the most convenient tree this topology finding errors relatively network that based upon the physical hierarchical topology must have least three levels the hierarchy the since network with central node and only one hierarchical level below would exhibit the physical topology network that based upon the physical hierarchical topology and with branching factor would classified physical linear the branching independent the total number nodes the network therefore the nodes the network require ports for connection other nodes the total number ports per node may kept low even though the total number nodes this makes the effect the cost adding ports each node totally dependent upon the branching factor and may therefore kept low required without any effect upon the total number nodes that are the total number point links network that based upon the physical hierarchical topology will one less than the total number nodes the the nodes network that based upon the physical hierarchical topology are required perform any processing upon the data that transmitted between nodes the the nodes that are higher levels the hierarchy will required perform more processing operations behalf other nodes than the nodes that are lower the such type network topology very useful and highly advantages secondary nodes allow more devices connected central point point connection having different levels the network makes more manageable hence easier fault identification and disadvantages maintenance the network may issue when the network spans great since variation bus the backbone the entire network definition tree topology combination bus and star example this network could cable other examples are dynamic tree based wireless networks for mining and otherwise mobile the naval postgraduate school monterey demonstrated such tree based wireless networks for border pilot aerial cameras kept aloft balloons relayed real time high resolution video ground personnel via dynamic self healing tree based hybrid hybrid networks use combination any two more such way that the resulting network does not exhibit one the standard topologies bus star ring etc for example tree network connected tree network still tree network hybrid topology always produced when two different basic network topologies are two common examples for hybrid network star ring network and star bus network star ring network consists two more star topologies connected using multistation access unit centralized star bus network consists two more star topologies connected using bus trunk the bus trunk serves the while grid and torus networks have found popularity high performance computing applications some systems have used genetic algorithms design custom networks that have the fewest possible hops between different some the resulting layouts are nearly although they function quite citation needed snowflake topology really star network exhibits characteristics hybrid network topology but not composed two different basic network topologies being daisy chain except for based the easiest way add more computers into network daisy chaining connecting each computer series the message intended for computer partway down the each system bounces along sequence until reaches the chained network can take two basic linear and linear topology puts way link between one computer and the however this was expensive the early days since each computer except for the ones each required two receivers and two connecting the computers each ring topology can advantage the ring that the number transmitters and receivers can cut since message will eventually loop all the way when node sends the message processed each computer the the ring breaks particular link then the transmission can sent via the reverse path thereby ensuring that all nodes are always connected the case single centralization the star topology reduces the probability network failure connecting all the peripheral nodes etc central when the physical star topology applied logical bus network such ethernet this central node traditionally hub rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node all peripheral nodes the sometimes including the originating all peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others transmitting and receiving the central node the failure transmission line linking any peripheral node the central node will result the isolation that peripheral node from all but the remaining peripheral nodes will however the disadvantage that the failure the central node will cause the failure all the peripheral the central node passive the originating node must able tolerate the reception echo its own delayed the way round trip transmission time and from the central plus any delay generated the central active star network has active central node that usually has the means prevent related tree topology hierarchical topology can viewed collection star networks arranged hierarchy this tree has individual peripheral nodes leaves which are required transmit and receive from one other node only and are not required act repeaters unlike the star the functionality the central node may the conventional star individual nodes may thus still isolated from the network point failure transmission path the link connecting leaf that leaf connection leaf node entire section the network becomes isolated from the alleviate the amount network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals all more advanced central nodes were developed that are able keep track the identities the nodes that are connected the these network switches will learn the layout the network listening each port during normal data examining the data packets and recording the identifier each connected node and which port connected lookup table held this lookup table then allows future transmissions forwarded the intended destination decentralization mesh topology partially connected mesh topology there are least two nodes with two more paths between them provide redundant paths used case the link providing one the paths this decentralization often used compensate for the failure disadvantage that present when using single device central node star and tree special kind limiting the number hops between two hypercube the number arbitrary forks mesh networks makes them more difficult design and but their decentralized nature makes them very the ieee published the shortest path bridging protocol eases configuration tasks and allows all paths active which increases bandwidth and redundancy between all this similar some ways grid network where linear ring topology used connect systems multiple multidimensional ring has toroidal topology for fully connected network complete topology full mesh topology network topology which there direct link between all pairs fully connected network with there are direct networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive set but provide high degree reliability due the multiple paths for data that are provided the large number redundant links between this topology mostly seen military applications see also broadcast communication network computer network computer network diagram ieee internet topology network simulator relay network
