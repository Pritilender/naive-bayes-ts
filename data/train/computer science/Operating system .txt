operating system features were developed the such resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs succession speed operating systems did not exist their modern and more complex forms until the early hardware features were that enabled use runtime libraries interrupts and parallel processing when personal computers became popular the operating systems were made for them similar concept those used larger the the earliest electronic digital systems had operating electronic systems this time were programmed rows mechanical switches jumper wires plug these were purpose systems for generated ballistics tables for the military controlled the printing payroll checks from data punched paper after programmable general purpose computers were machine languages consisting strings the binary digits and punched paper were introduced that sped the programming process apollo program the early computer could execute only one program each user had sole use the computer for limited period time and would arrive scheduled time with program and data punched paper cards punched the program would loaded into the and the machine would set work until the program completed programs could generally debugged via front panel using toggle switches and panel said that alan turing was master this the early manchester mark machine and was already deriving the primitive conception operating system from the principles the universal turing machine later machines came with libraries programs which would linked program assist operations such input and output and generating computer code from readable symbolic code this was the genesis the day operating however machines still ran single job cambridge university england the job queue was one time washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored pegs indicate citation needed mainframes mainframe computer history ibm mainframe operating systems through the many major features were pioneered the field operating including batch processing input output interrupt buffering multitasking spooling runtime libraries link loading and programs for sorting records these features were included not included application software the option application rather than separate operating system used all the share operating system was released integrated utility for the ibm and later the and mainframes although was quickly supplanted ibsys ibjob the and during the ibm introduced the concept single spanning entire product which was crucial for the success the machines ibm current mainframe operating systems are distant descendants this original system and applications written for can still run modern citation needed also pioneered the concept that the operating system keeps

been developed for mainframes and minimalistic operating systems were often loaded from rom and known monitors one notable early disk operating system was which was supported many early microcomputers and was closely imitated microsoft dos which became wildly popular the operating system chosen for the ibm version was called ibm dos dos the apple computer now apple abandoned its popular apple series microcomputers introduce the apple macintosh computer with innovative graphical user interface the mac the introduction the intel cpu chip with bit architecture and paging capabilities provided personal computers with the ability run multitasking operating systems like those earlier minicomputers and mainframes microsoft responded this progress hiring dave cutler who had developed the vms operating system for digital equipment corporation would lead the development the windows operating which continues serve the basis for operating systems steve jobs founder apple started next computer which developed the nextstep operating nextstep would later acquired apple and along with code from freebsd the core mac the gnu project was started activist and programmer richard stallman with the goal creating complete free software replacement the proprietary unix operating while the project was highly successful duplicating the functionality various parts development the gnu hurd kernel proved finnish computer science student linus torvalds with cooperation from volunteers collaborating over the released the first version the linux kernel was soon merged with the gnu user space components and system software form complete operating since the combination the two major components has usually been referred simply linux the software naming convention that stallman and the free software foundation remain opposed preferring the name the berkeley software known bsd the unix derivative distributed the university berkeley starting the freely distributed and ported many eventually also gained following for use mainly freebsd netbsd and openbsd examples operating systems unix and like operating systems unix unix unix was originally written assembly language ken thompson wrote mainly based bcpl based his experience the multics project was replaced and rewritten developed into complex family related operating systems which have been influential every modern operating system see history the unix like family diverse group operating with several major categories including system bsd and linux the name unix trademark the open group which licenses for use with any operating system that has been shown conform their commonly used refer the large set operating systems which resemble the original unix like systems run wide variety computer architectures they are used heavily for servers well workstations academic and engineering free unix such linux and bsd are popular these four operating systems are certified the open group holder the unix and aix are both descendants the original system unix and are designed run only their respective sun solaris operating system can run multiple types including and sparc servers and apple replacement for earlier mac hybrid kernel based bsd variant derived from nextstep mach and freebsd unix interoperability was sought establishing the posix standard the posix standard can applied any operating although was originally created for various unix bsd and its descendants first server world wide web berkeley software distribution subgroup the unix family the berkeley software distribution family which includes freebsd netbsd and openbsd these operating systems are most commonly found webservers although they can also function personal computer the internet owes much its existence many the protocols now commonly used computers send and receive data over network were widely implemented and refined the world wide web was also first demonstrated number computers running based bsd called nextstep bsd has its roots university berkeley installed its first unix over students and staff the computer science department there began adding new programs make things such text when berkeley received new vax computers with unix the undergraduates modified unix even more order take advantage the hardware the defense advanced research projects agency the department defense took and decided fund the many corporations and government organizations took notice and started use version unix instead the official one distributed steve jobs upon leaving apple formed next company that manufactured end computers running variation bsd called nextstep one these computers was used tim lee the first webserver create the world wide developers like keith bostic encouraged the project replace any free code that originated with bell once this was however eventually after two years legal the bsd project came out ahead and spawned number free such freebsd and netbsd formerly mac line open core graphical operating systems marketed and sold apple the latest which loaded all currently shipping macintosh computers the successor the original mac which had been primary operating system since unlike its unix operating system built technology that had been developed next through the second half the and until apple purchased the company early the operating system was first released mac server with oriented version mac cheetah following march since six more distinct client and server editions have been until the two were merged lion the most recent version mavericks which was announced june and released october releases through are named after big cats starting with mavericks versions are named after inspirational places california prior its merging with the server edition server was architecturally identical its desktop counterpart and usually ran line macintosh server hardware server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access key network services including mail transfer agent samba server ldap server domain name server and with mac lion all server aspects mac server have been integrated into the client version and the product branded dropping mac from the the server tools are now offered linux and gnu gnu linux linux kernel ubuntu linux distribution android linux like operating system that was developed without any actual unix unlike bsd and its linux can used wide range devices from supercomputers the linux kernel released under open source license anyone can read and modify its has been modified run large variety although estimates suggest that linux used all personal has been widely adopted for use servers and embedded systems such cell linux has superseded unix most which and used the most powerful supercomputers the the linux kernel used some popular such red hat debian ubuntu linux mint and google android the gnu project mass collaboration programmers who seek create completely free and open operating system that was similar unix but with completely original was started richard stallman and responsible for many the parts most linux thousands pieces software for virtually every operating system are licensed under the gnu general public license meanwhile the linux kernel began side project linus torvalds university student from torvalds began work and posted information about his project newsgroup for computer students and received wave support and volunteers who ended creating fledged programmers from gnu took and members both projects worked integrate the finished gnu parts with the linux kernel order create fledged operating google chromium google chromium chromium operating system based the linux kernel and designed google since chromium targets computer users who spend most their time the mainly web browser with limited ability run local though has file manager and media instead relies internet applications web apps used the web browser accomplish tasks such word chromium differs from chrome that chromium source and used primarily developers whereas chrome the operating system shipped out microsoft windows microsoft windows microsoft windows family proprietary operating systems designed microsoft corporation and primarily targeted intel architecture based with estimated percent total usage share web connected the newest version windows for workstations and windows server for windows recently overtook windows most used microsoft windows originated operating environment running top dos which was the standard operating system shipped most intel architecture personal computers the windows was released which only used dos for backwards win could run mode dos and bits windows drivers windows released was the last version the later versions have all been based the windows kernel current client versions windows run and bit arm microprocessors addition itanium still supported older server version windows server the windows supported additional server editions windows are widely recent microsoft has expended significant capital effort promote the use windows server operating system however windows usage servers not widespread personal windows competes against linux and bsd for server market other there have been many operating systems that were significant their day but are longer such amigaos from ibm and mac the unix precursor mac beos xts risc morphos haiku baremetal and freemint some are still used niche markets and continue developed minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist openvms formerly from dec still under active development hewlett packard yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively for operating systems education research operating system typical example system that fulfills both roles minix while for example singularity used purely for other operating systems have failed win significant market but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating not least bell plan hybrid operating system console runs natively architecture not runs windows usual and with toggle seconds can uses real android console can runs and intel tablet with components the components operating system all exist order make the different parts computer work all user software needs through the operating system order use any the whether simple mouse keyboard complex internet kernel kernel with the aid the firmware and device drivers the kernel provides the most basic level control over all the hardware manages memory access for programs the ram determines which programs get access which hardware sets resets the operating states for optimal operation all and organizes the data for term non volatile storage with file systems such media tapes flash etc program execution process the operating system provides interface between application program and the computer that application program can interact with the hardware only obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating the operating system also set services which simplify development and execution application executing application program involves the creation process the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other establishes priority for the process tasking loads program binary code into and initiates execution the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware interrupts interrupt interrupts are central operating they provide efficient way for the operating system interact with and react its the having the operating system watch the various sources input for events that require can found older systems with very small stacks bytes but are unusual modern systems with large interrupt based programming directly supported most modern interrupts provide computer with way automatically saving local register and running specific code response even very basic computers support hardware and allow the programmer specify code which may run when that event takes when interrupt the hardware automatically suspends whatever program currently saves its and runs computer code previously associated with the this analogous placing bookmark book response phone modern operating interrupts are handled the operating kernel interrupts may come from either the hardware from the running when hardware device triggers the operating kernel decides how deal with this generally running some processing the amount code being run depends the priority the interrupt for person usually responds smoke detector alarm before answering the the processing hardware interrupts task that usually delegated software called device driver which may either part the operating part another device drivers may then relay information running program various program may also trigger interrupt the operating program wishes access hardware for may interrupt the operating which causes control passed back the the kernel will then process the program wishes additional resources wishes shed such will trigger interrupt get the modes protected mode supervisor mode protected mode modern cpus support multiple modes cpus with this capability use least two protected mode and supervisor mode the supervisor mode used the operating kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access such controlling how memory written and and communication with devices like graphics protected used for almost everything applications operate within protected and can only use hardware communicating with the which controls everything supervisor cpus might have other modes similar protected mode such the virtual modes order emulate older processor such bit processors bit bit processors bit when computer first starts automatically running supervisor mode the first few programs run the being the bios efi bootloader and the operating system have unlimited access and this required initializing protected environment can only done outside however when the operating system passes control another can place the cpu into protected mode protected mode programs may have access more limited set the user program may leave protected mode only triggering causing control passed back the kernel this way the operating system can maintain exclusive control over things like access hardware and the term protected mode generally refers one more cpu which contain information that the running program allowed attempts alter these resources generally causes switch supervisor where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting for killing the memory management memory management among other multiprogramming operating system kernel must responsible for managing all system memory which currently use this ensures that program does not interfere with memory already use another since programs time each program must have independent access cooperative memory used many early operating assumes that all programs make voluntary use the kernel memory and not exceed their allocated this system memory management almost never seen any since programs often contain bugs which can cause them exceed their allocated program may cause memory used one more other programs affected malicious programs viruses may purposefully alter another may affect the operation the operating system with cooperative memory takes only one misbehaved program crash the memory protection enables the kernel limit access the various methods memory protection including memory segmentation and paging all methods require some level hardware support such the mmu which exist all both segmentation and certain protected mode registers specify the cpu what memory address should allow running program attempts access other addresses will trigger interrupt which will cause the cpu enter supervisor mode placing the kernel this called segmentation violation for and since both difficult assign meaningful result such and because usually sign misbehaving the kernel will generally resort terminating the offending and will report the windows had some level memory but programs could easily circumvent the need use general protection fault would indicating segmentation violation had however the system would often crash virtual memory virtual memory page fault the use virtual memory addressing such paging means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use any given allowing the operating system use the same memory locations for multiple program tries access memory that its current range accessible but nonetheless has been allocated the kernel will interrupted the same way would the program were exceed its allocated see section memory under unix this kind interrupt referred page fault when the kernel detects page fault will generally adjust the virtual memory range the program which triggered granting access the memory this gives the kernel discretionary power over where particular memory even whether not has actually been allocated modern operating memory which accessed less frequently can temporarily stored disk other media make that space available for use other this called swapping area memory can used multiple and what that memory area contains can swapped exchanged virtual provides the programmer the user with the perception that there much larger amount ram the computer than really multitasking computer multitasking process management context switch preemptive multitasking cooperative multitasking multitasking refers the running multiple independent computer programs the same giving the appearance that performing the tasks the same since most computers can most one two things one this generally done via which means that each program uses share the time operating system kernel contains piece software called scheduler which determines how much time each program will spend and which order execution control should passed control passed process the which allows the program access the cpu and later control returned the kernel through some that another program may allowed use the this called passing control between the kernel and applications called context switch early model which governed the allocation time programs was called cooperative multitasking this when control passed program the may execute for long wants before explicitly returning control the this means that malicious malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the but can hang the entire system enters infinite loop modern operating systems extend the concepts application preemption device drivers and kernel that the operating system has preemptive control over internal times the philosophy governing preemptive multitasking that ensuring that all programs are given regular time the this implies that all programs must limited how much time they are allowed spend the cpu without being accomplish modern operating system kernels make use timed protected mode timer set the kernel which triggers return supervisor mode after the specified time has see above sections interrupts and dual mode many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking perfectly home computers generally run small number well tested the amigaos having emptive multitasking from its very first windows was the first version microsoft windows which enforced preemptive but reach the home user market until windows since windows was targeted disk access and file systems virtual file system access data stored disks central feature all operating computers store data disks using files which are structured specific ways order allow for faster higher and make better use out the available the specific way which files are stored disk called file system and enables files have names and also allows them stored hierarchy directories folders arranged directory tree early operating systems generally supported single type disk drive and only one kind file early file systems were limited their speed and the kinds file names and directory structures they could these limitations often reflected limitations the operating systems they were designed making very difficult for operating system support more than one file while many simpler operating systems support limited range options for accessing storage operating systems like unix and linux support technology known virtual file system operating system such unix supports wide array storage regardless their design file systems allowing them accessed through common application programming interface this makes unnecessary for programs have any knowledge about the device they are vfs allows the operating system provide programs with access unlimited number devices with infinite variety file systems installed through the use specific device drivers and file system connected storage device such hard drive accessed through device driver the device driver understands the specific language the drive and able translate that language into standard language used the operating system access all disk this the language block devices when the kernel has appropriate device driver can then access the contents the disk drive raw which may contain one more file file system driver used translate the commands used access each specific file system into standard set commands that the operating system can use talk all file programs can then deal with these file systems the basis and contained within hierarchical they can delete open and close well gather various information about including access size free and creation and modification various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems allowed characters file case sensitivity and the presence various kinds file attributes makes the implementation single interface for every file system daunting operating systems tend recommend using and support file systems specifically designed for for ntfs windows and ext and reiserfs however third party drives are usually available give support for the most widely used file systems most purpose operating systems for ntfs available linux through ntfs and and reiserfs are available windows through party support for file systems highly varied among modern operating although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers operating systems vary file system support and the disk formats they may installed under each file system usually limited application certain for cds must use iso udf and windows vista ntfs the only file system which the operating system can installed possible install linux onto many types file unlike other operating linux and unix allow any file system used regardless the media stored whether hard disc dvd usb flash even contained within file located another file device drivers device driver device driver specific type computer software developed allow interaction with hardware typically this constitutes interface for communicating with the through the specific computer bus communications subsystem that the hardware connected providing commands receiving data from the and the other the requisite interfaces the operating system and software specialized dependent computer program which also operating system specific that enables another typically operating system applications software package computer program running under the operating system interact transparently with hardware and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous dependent hardware interfacing the key design goal device drivers abstraction every model hardware even within the same class newer models also are released manufacturers that provide more reliable better performance and these newer models are often controlled computers and their operating systems cannot expected know how control every both now and the solve this operating systems essentially dictate how every type device should the function the device driver then translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific theory new which controlled new should function correctly suitable driver this new driver will ensure that the device appears operate usual from the operating point under versions windows before vista and versions linux before all driver execution was meaning that driver entered infinite loop would freeze the more recent revisions these operating systems incorporate kernel where the kernel interrupts the driver give and then separates itself from the process until receives response from the device gives more tasks networking computer network currently most operating systems support variety networking hardware and applications for using this means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate common network for sharing resources such computing files printers and scanners using either wired wireless networks can essentially allow operating system access the resources remote computer support the same functions could those resources were connected directly the local this includes everything from simple using networked file systems even sharing another graphics sound some network services allow the resources computer accessed such ssh which allows networked users direct access command line client server networking allows program called connect via network another called servers offer various services other network computers and these services are usually provided through ports numbered access points beyond the network address each port number usually associated with maximum one running which responsible for handling requests that being user can turn access the local hardware resources that computer passing requests the operating system many operating systems support one more specific open networking protocols for sna ibm systems decnet systems from digital equipment corporation and specific protocols smb specific protocols for specific tasks may also supported such nfs for file protocols like esound esd can easily extended over the network provide sound from local remote sound security computer security computer being secure depends number technologies working modern operating system provides access number which are available software running the and external devices like networks via the the operating system must capable distinguishing between requests which should allowed and others which should not while some systems may simply distinguish between privileged and systems commonly have form requester identity such user establish identity there may process authentication often username must and each username may have other methods such magnetic cards biometric might used some especially connections from the resources may accessed with authentication all such reading files over network also covered the concept requester identity authorization the particular services and resources accessible the requester once logged into system are tied either the user account the variously configured groups users which the requester addition the disallow model system with high level security will also offer auditing these would allow tracking requests for access resources such who has been reading this internal security from already running program only possible all possibly harmful requests must carried out through interrupts the operating system programs can directly access hardware and they cannot external security involves request from outside the such login connected console some kind network external requests are often passed through device drivers the operating where they can passed onto carried out security operating systems has long been concern because highly sensitive data held both commercial and military the united states government department defense created the trusted computer system evaluation criteria which standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness this became vital importance operating system because the tcsec was used classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the storage and retrieval sensitive classified information network services include offerings such file print email web and file transfer protocols most which can have compromised the front line security are hardware devices known firewalls intrusion prevention the operating system there are number software firewalls well intrusion prevention most modern operating systems include software which enabled software firewall can configured allow deny network traffic from service application running the operating therefore one can install and running insecure such telnet and not have threatened security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying connect the service that alternative and the only sandbox strategy available systems that not meet the popek and goldberg virtualization requirements the operating system not running user programs native but instead either emulates processor provides host for code based system such internal security especially relevant for user allows each user the system have private files that the other users cannot tamper with internal security also vital auditing any since program can potentially bypass the operating inclusive bypassing user interface bourne again shell operating system user interface every computer that operated individual requires user interface the user interface usually referred shell and essential human interaction the user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices such keyboard mouse credit card reader and requests operating system services display prompts status messages and such output hardware devices such video monitor printer the two most common forms user interface have historically been the command line interface where computer commands are typed out and the graphical user interface where visual environment most commonly wimp graphical user interfaces kde plasma desktop most the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces and often include some computer such the original implementation mac the gui integrated into the kernel while technically graphical user interface not operating system incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the gui more responsive reducing the number context switches required for the gui perform its output other operating systems are modular separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the operating the vms and many others had operating systems that were built this linux and mac are also built this modern releases microsoft windows such windows vista implement graphics subsystem that mostly however the graphics drawing routines versions between windows and windows server exist mostly kernel windows had very little distinction between the interface and the many computer operating systems allow the user install create any user interface they the window system conjunction with gnome kde plasma desktop commonly found setup most unix and unix like linux solaris systems number windows shell replacements have been released for microsoft which offer alternatives the included windows shell but the shell itself cannot separated from numerous based guis have existed over most derived from competition among the various vendors unix ibm sun led much though effort standardize the cose and cde failed for various and were eventually eclipsed the widespread adoption gnome and desktop environment prior free software based toolkits and desktop motif was the prevalent desktop combination and was the basis upon which cde was graphical user interfaces evolve over for windows has modified its user interface almost every time new major version windows and the gui changed dramatically with the introduction real time operating systems real time operating system time operating system operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines real time computing such applications include some small embedded systems automobile engine industrial spacecraft industrial and some scale computing early example scale time operating system was transaction processing facility developed american airlines and ibm for the sabre airline reservations system embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use real time operating system such vxworks pikeos ecos qnx montavista linux and rtlinux windows real time operating system that shares similar apis desktop windows but shares none desktop codebase citation needed symbian also has rtos kernel starting with version some embedded systems use operating systems such palm bsd and linux although such operating systems not support time operating system development hobby hobbyist operating system development operating system development one the most complicated activities which computing hobbyist may hobby operating system may classified one whose code has not been directly derived from existing operating and has few users and active developers some hobby development support homebrew computing for simple single board computer powered microprocessor development may for architecture already widespread operating system development may come from entirely new may commence modeling existing operating either the hobbyist her own may interact with small and sometimes unstructured group individuals who have like examples hobby operating system include reactos and syllable diversity operating systems and portability application software generally written for use specific operating and sometimes even for specific when porting the application run another the functionality required that application may implemented differently that the names meaning etc requiring the application changed otherwise maintained this cost supporting operating systems diversity can avoided instead writing applications against software platforms like java these abstractions have already borne the cost adaptation specific operating systems and their system libraries another approach for operating system vendors adopt for posix and abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting
