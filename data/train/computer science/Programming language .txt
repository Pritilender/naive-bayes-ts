programming languages preceded the invention the computer and were used direct the behavior machines such jacquard looms and player pianos thousands different programming languages have been mainly the computer and many more still are being created every many programming languages require computation specified imperative form sequence operations while other languages utilize other forms program specification such the declarative form the desired result not how achieve the description programming language usually split into the two components syntax and semantics some languages are defined

are not usually considered programming programming languages however share the syntax with markup languages computational semantics xslt for turing complete xml moreover latex which mostly used for structuring also contains turing complete the term computer language sometimes used interchangeably with programming however the usage both terms varies among including the exact scope one usage describes programming languages subset computer this languages used computing that have different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer for markup languages are sometimes referred computer languages emphasize that they are not meant used for another usage regards programming languages theoretical constructs for programming abstract and computer languages the subset thereof that runs physical which have finite hardware john reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just much programming languages are the languages intended for also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior computer are programming despite the fact they are commonly not and remarks that ignorance programming language concepts the reason for many flaws input history history programming languages programming language generations early developments the first programming languages designed communicate instructions computer were written the early high level programming language designed for computer was plankalk developed for the german konrad zuse between and however was not implemented until and john mauchly short code proposed was one the first level languages ever developed for electronic computer unlike machine code short code statements represented mathematical expressions understandable however the program had translated into machine code every time making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine manchester mark autocode the university manchester alick glennie developed autocode the early programming language used compiler automatically convert the language into machine the first code and compiler was developed for the mark computer the university manchester and considered the first compiled high level programming the second autocode was developed for the mark brooker and was called the mark autocode brooker also developed autocode for the ferranti mercury the conjunction with the university the version for the edsac was devised hartley university cambridge mathematical laboratory known edsac autocode was straight development from mercury autocode adapted for local and was noted for its object code optimisation and language diagnostics which were advanced for the contemporary but separate thread atlas autocode was developed for the university manchester atlas machine another early programming language was devised grace hopper the called flow matic was developed for the univac remington rand during the period from until hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical and early she and her team wrote specification for english programming language and implemented the matic compiler became publicly available early and was substantially complete flow matic was major influence the design cobol since only and its direct descendent aimaco were actual use the the language fortran was developed ibm the mid and became the first widely used level general purpose programming refinement the period from the the late brought the development the major language paradigms now though many aspects were refinements ideas the very first third generation programming languages apl introduced array programming and influenced functional programming originally called was designed the early incorporate the best ideas from fortran and cobol with block structures taken from algol the simula was the first language designed support object oriented programming the smalltalk followed with the first purely object oriented was developed between and system programming language and remains prolog designed was the first logic programming language built polymorphic type system top lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages each these languages spawned entire family and most modern languages count least one them their the and also saw considerable debate over the merits structured programming and whether programming languages should designed support edsger dijkstra famous letter published the communications the acm argued that goto statements should eliminated from all higher programming the and also saw expansion techniques that reduced the footprint program well improved productivity the programmer and the card deck for early was lot smaller for the same functionality expressed deck consolidation and growth the were years relative combined oriented and systems the united states government standardized ada systems programming language derived from pascal and intended for use defense japan and vast sums were spent investigating called fifth languages that incorporated logic programming the functional languages community moved standardize and rather than inventing new all these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented the previous one important trend language design for programming scale systems during the was increased focus the use modules scale organizational units modula ada and all developed notable module systems the although other such already had extensive support for modular module systems were often wedded generic programming constructs the rapid growth the internet the created opportunities for new perl originally unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic websites java came used for side and bytecode virtual machines became popular again commercial settings with their promise write run anywhere ucsd pascal had been popular for time the early these developments were not fundamentally rather they were refinements existing languages and and largely based the family programming programming language evolution both industry and current directions include security and reliability new kinds modularity mixins delegates aspects and database integration such linq the gls are examples languages which are domain specific such sql which manipulates and returns sets data rather than the scalar values which are canonical most programming perl for with its here document can hold multiple well multiple javascript part its own perl code and use variable interpolation the here support language elements all programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description data and the processes transformations applied them like the addition two numbers the selection item from these primitives are defined syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning syntax parse tree syntax highlighting python syntax programming programming surface form known its syntax most programming languages are purely they use sequences text including numbers and much like written natural the other there are some programming languages which are more graphical using visual relationships between symbols specify the syntax language describes the possible combinations symbols that form syntactically correct the meaning given combination symbols handled semantics either formal coded reference implementation since most languages are this article discusses textual programming language syntax usually defined using combination regular expressions for lexical structure and backus naur form for grammatical structure below simple based lisp this grammar specifies the expression either atom list atom either number symbol number unbroken sequence one more decimal optionally preceded plus minus symbol letter followed zero more any characters excluding and list matched pair with zero more expressions inside the following are examples formed token sequences this and not all syntactically correct programs are semantically many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless per the and may depending the language specification and the soundness the result error translation some such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when program defined within may still have meaning that not intended the person who wrote using natural language may not possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence the sentence may colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically formed but has generally accepted john married grammatically formed but expresses meaning that cannot the following language fragment syntactically but performs operations that are not semantically defined the operation has meaning for value having complex type and not defined because the value the null pointer sqrt the type declaration the first line were the program would trigger error the variable would not but the program would still syntactically since type declarations provide only semantic the grammar needed specify programming language can classified its position the chomsky hierarchy the syntax most programming languages can specified using grammar they are context free grammars some including perl and contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing languages that have constructs that allow the programmer alter the behavior the parser make syntax analysis undecidable problem and generally blur the distinction between parsing and contrast lisp macro system and blocks which may contain general macros are merely string and not require code semantics the term semantics refers the meaning opposed their form syntax static semantics the static semantics defines restrictions the structure valid texts that are hard impossible express standard syntactic for compiled static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can checked compile examples include checking that every identifier declared before used languages that require such that the labels the arms case statement are many important restrictions this like checking that identifiers are used the appropriate context not adding integer function that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type can enforced defining them rules logic called type system other forms static analyses like data flow analysis may also part static newer programming languages like java and have definite assignment analysis form data flow part their static dynamic semantics semantics programming languages once data has been the machine must instructed perform operations the for the semantics may define the strategy which expressions are evaluated the manner which control structures conditionally execute statements the dynamic semantics also known execution semantics language defines how and when the various constructs language should produce program there are many ways defining execution natural language often used specify the execution semantics languages commonly used significant amount academic research went into formal semantics programming languages which allow execution semantics specified formal results from this field research have seen limited application programming language design and implementation outside type system data type type system type safety type system defines how programming language classifies values and expressions into types how can manipulate those types and how they the goal type system verify and usually enforce certain level correctness programs written that language detecting certain incorrect any decidable type system involves while rejects many incorrect can also prohibit some albeit unusual order bypass this number languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may used the programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation between different most typed the type system used only type check programs but number usually functional infer types relieving the programmer from the need write type the formal design and study type systems known type theory typed versus untyped languages language typed the specification every operation defines types data which the operation with the implication that not applicable other for the data represented string most programming dividing number string has most modern programming languages will therefore reject any program attempting perform such some languages the meaningless operation will detected when the program compiled static type and rejected the while will detected when the program run dynamic type resulting time exception special case typed languages are the single type languages these are often scripting markup such rexx sgml and have only one data most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric untyped language such most assembly languages allows any operation performed any which are generally considered sequences bits various high level languages which are untyped include bcpl tcl and some varieties forth while few languages are considered typed from the point view type theory verifying rejecting all operations most modern languages offer degree many production languages provide means bypass subvert the type trading safety for finer control over the execution see casting static versus dynamic typing static typing all expressions have their types determined prior when the program typically for and are integer they cannot passed function that expects stored variable that defined hold statically typed languages can either manifestly typed type inferred the first the programmer must explicitly write types certain textual positions for variable declarations the second the compiler infers the types expressions and declarations based most mainstream statically typed such and java are manifestly complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream such haskell and however many manifestly typed languages support partial type for java and both infer types certain limited dynamic typing also called latent typing determines the safety operations run other types are associated with run time values rather than textual expressions with inferred dynamically typed languages not require the programmer write explicit type annotations among other this may permit single variable refer values different types different points the program however type errors cannot automatically detected until piece code actually potentially making debugging more lisp perl python javascript and ruby are dynamically weak and strong typing weak typing allows value one type treated for example treating string this can occasionally but can also allow some kinds program faults undetected compile time and even run time strong typing prevents the attempt perform operation the wrong type value raises strongly typed languages are often termed type safe safe alternative definition for weakly refers such perl and javascript which permit large number implicit type for the expression implicitly converts and this conversion succeeds even string such implicit conversions are often but they can mask programming strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal but usage the literature some use the term strongly typed mean strongly statically typed even more mean simply statically typed thus has been called both strongly typed and statically may seem odd some professional programmers that could statically however notice that the use the generic the void pointer does allow for casting pointers other pointers without needing explicit this extremely similar somehow casting array bytes any kind datatype without using explicit such standard library and time system standard library most programming languages have associated core library sometimes known the standard especially included part the published language which conventionally made available all implementations the core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used data and mechanisms for input and core library often treated part the language its although the designers may have treated separate many language specifications define core that must made available all and the case standardized languages this core library may the line between language and its core library therefore differs from language indeed some languages are designed that the meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even described without referring the core for java string literal defined instance the class similarly smalltalk anonymous function expression block constructs instance the class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice construct the rest the language library and the language designers not even bother say which portions the language must implemented language and which must implemented parts design and implementation programming languages share properties with natural languages related their purpose vehicles for having syntactic form separate from its and showing language families related languages branching one from but artificial they also differ fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through significant difference that programming language can fully described and studied its since has precise and finite natural languages have changing meanings given their users different while constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground with specific they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that programming language many programming languages have been designed from altered meet new and combined with other many have eventually fallen into although there have been attempts design one universal programming language that serves all all them have failed generally accepted filling this the need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity contexts which languages are programs range from tiny scripts written individual hobbyists huge systems written hundreds programmers programmers range expertise from novices who need simplicity above all experts who may comfortable with considerable programs must balance size and simplicity systems ranging from microcontrollers supercomputers programs may written once and not change for they may undergo continual finally programmers may simply differ their they may accustomed discussing problems and expressing them particular one common trend the development programming languages has been add more ability solve problems using higher level abstraction the earliest programming languages were tied very closely the underlying hardware the new programming languages have features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware because programmers are less tied the complexity the their programs can more computing with less effort from the this lets them write more functionality per time natural language programming has been proposed way eliminate the need for specialized language for however this goal remains distant dated info and its benefits are open edsger dijkstra took the position that the use formal language essential prevent the introduction meaningless and dismissed natural language programming foolish alan perlis was similarly dismissive the hybrid approaches have been taken structured english and sql designers and users must construct number artifacts that govern and enable the practice the most important these artifacts are the language specification and implementation specification programming language specification the specification programming language intended provide definition that the language users and the implementors can use determine whether the behavior program given its source code programming language specification can take several including the explicit definition the static and execution semantics the while syntax commonly specified using formal semantic definitions may written natural language the language formal semantics standard and scheme specifications description the behavior translator for the language the and fortran specifications the syntax and semantics the language have inferred from this which may written natural formal reference model implementation sometimes written the language being specified prolog ansi rexx the syntax and semantics the language are explicit the behavior the reference implementation programming language implementation implementation programming language provides way execute that program one more configurations hardware and there broadly two approaches programming language compilation and interpretation generally possible implement language using either the output compiler may executed hardware program called some implementations that make use the interpreter approach there distinct boundary between compiling and for some implementations basic compile and then execute the source line programs that are executed directly the hardware usually run several orders magnitude faster than those that are interpreted citation needed one technique for improving the performance interpreted programs just time compilation here the virtual machine just before translates the blocks bytecode which are going used machine for direct execution the usage thousands different programming languages have been mainly the computing programming languages differ from most other forms human expression that they require greater degree precision and when using natural language communicate with other human authors and speakers can ambiguous and make small and still expect their intent however figuratively computers exactly what they are told and cannot understand what code the programmer intended the combination the language and the inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program within the domain control that the other ideas about algorithm can communicated humans without the precision required for execution using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written programming programming language provides structured mechanism for defining pieces and the operations transformations that may carried out automatically that programmer uses the abstractions present the language represent the concepts involved these concepts are represented collection the simplest elements available called primitives programming the process which programmers combine these primitives compose new adapt existing ones new uses changing programs for computer might executed batch process without human user might type commands interactive session interpreter this case the commands are simply whose execution chained when language used give commands software application such unix shell other command line interface called scripting language citation needed measuring language usage measuring programming language popularity difficult determine which programming languages are most widely and what usage means varies one language may occupy the greater number programmer different one have more lines and third utilize the most cpu some languages are very popular for particular kinds for cobol still strong the corporate data often large mainframes fortran scientific and engineering and embedded applications and operating other languages are regularly used write many different kinds various methods measuring language each subject different bias over what have been counting the number job advertisements that mention the language the number books sold that teach describe the language estimates the number existing lines code written the which may underestimate languages not often found public searches

descending order overall java php javascript python shell ruby objective and taxonomies categorical list programming languages there overarching classification scheme for programming given programming language does not usually have single ancestor languages commonly arise combining the elements several predecessor languages with new ideas circulation the ideas that originate one language will diffuse throughout family related and then leap suddenly across familial gaps appear entirely different the task further complicated the fact that languages can classified along multiple for java both oriented language because encourages oriented and concurrent language because contains constructs for running multiple threads python oriented scripting language broad programming languages divide into programming paradigms and classification intended domain with general purpose programming languages distinguished from domain specific programming languages traditionally programming languages have been regarded describing computation terms imperative issuing these are generally called imperative programming languages great deal research programming languages has been aimed blurring the distinction between program set instructions and program assertion about the desired which the main feature declarative programming more refined paradigms include procedural programming object oriented programming functional programming and logic programming some languages are hybrids paradigms assembly language not much paradigm direct model underlying machine programming languages might
