perform operations data quantum computers are different from digital computers based transistors whereas digital computers require data encoded into binary digits bits each which always one two definite states quantum computation uses qubits quantum which can superpositions theoretical model the quantum turing machine also known the universal quantum quantum computers share theoretical similarities with non deterministic and probabilistic computers one example the ability more than one state the field quantum computing was first introduced yuri manin and richard feynman quantum computer with spins quantum bits was also formulated for use quantum space time quantum computing still its infancy but experiments have been carried out which quantum computational operations were executed very small number both practical and theoretical research and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security such cryptanalysis large scale quantum computers will able solve certain problems much quicker than any classical computer using the best currently known algorithms like integer factorization using shor algorithm the simulation quantum body systems there exist quantum algorithms such simon algorithm which run faster than any possible probabilistic classical given sufficient computational however classical computer could made simulate any quantum quantum computation does not violate the church turing thesis contents basis bits qubits operation potential quantum decoherence developments timeline relation computational complexity theory see also references bibliography general references external links basis classical computer has memory made bits where each bit represents either one quantum computer maintains sequence qubits single qubit can represent any quantum superposition these two qubit states moreover pair qubits can any quantum superposition states and three qubits any superposition quantum computer with qubits can arbitrary superposition different states simultaneously this compares normal computer that can only one these states any one quantum computer operates setting the qubits controlled initial state that represents the problem hand and manipulating those qubits with fixed sequence quantum logic gates the sequence gates applied called quantum algorithm the calculation ends with collapsing the system qubits into one the pure where each qubit purely zero the outcome can therefore most classical bits quantum algorithms are often that they provide the correct solution only with certain known example implementation qubits for quantum computer could start with the use particles with two spin states down and typically written and and but fact any system possessing observable quantity which conserved under time evolution such that has least two discrete and sufficiently spaced consecutive eigenvalues suitable candidate for implementing this true because any such system can mapped onto effective spin system bits qubits quantum computer with given number qubits fundamentally different from classical computer composed the same number classical for represent the state qubit system classical computer would require the storage complex coefficients although this fact may seem indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical care must taken not overlook the fact that the qubits are only probabilistic superposition all their this means that when the final state the qubits they will only found one the possible configurations they were before moreover incorrect think the qubits only being one particular state before measurement since the fact that they were superposition states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes the for consider first classical computer that operates bit register the state the computer any time probability distribution over the different bit strings deterministic then exactly one these states with probability however probabilistic computer then there possibility being any one number different can describe this probabilistic state eight nonnegative numbers where probability computer state probability computer state etc there restriction that these probabilities sum the state qubit quantum computer similarly described dimensional vector called ket here however the coefficients can have complex values and the sum the squares the magnitudes that must equal these square magnitudes represent the probability amplitudes given however because complex number encodes not just magnitude but also direction the complex plane the phase difference between any two coefficients represents meaningful this fundamental difference between quantum computing and probabilistic classical you measure the three you will observe bit the probability measuring given string the squared magnitude that coefficient the probability measuring the probability measuring etc thus measuring quantum state described complex coefficients gives the classical probability distribution and say that the quantum state collapses classical state result making the note that dimensional vector can specified many different ways depending what basis chosen for the the basis bit strings known the computational other possible bases are unit length orthogonal vectors and the eigenvectors the pauli operator ket notation often used make the choice basis for the state the computational basis can written the computational basis for single qubit two and using the eigenvectors the single qubit and operation list unsolved problems physics universal quantum computer sufficient efficiently simulate arbitrary physical while classical bit state and quantum qubit state are both dimensional vectors they are manipulated quite differently for classical quantum for computing either the system must for example into the zeros corresponding the vector classical randomized the system evolves according the application stochastic matrices which preserve that the probabilities add one preserve the norm quantum the other allowed operations are unitary matrices which are effectively rotations they preserve that the sum the squares add the euclidean norm exactly what unitaries can applied depend the physics the quantum consequently since rotations can undone rotating quantum computations are reversible quantum operations can probabilistic combinations quantum computation really does generalize classical see quantum circuit for more precise finally upon termination the the result needs read the case classical sample from the probability distribution the bit register obtain one definite bit say quantum measure the qubit which equivalent collapsing the quantum state down classical distribution with the coefficients the classical state being the squared magnitudes the coefficients for the quantum described followed sampling from that note that this destroys the original quantum many algorithms will only give the correct answer with certain however repeatedly running and measuring the quantum the probability getting the correct answer can for more details the sequences operations used for various quantum algorithms see universal quantum computer shor algorithm grover algorithm deutsch jozsa algorithm amplitude amplification quantum fourier transform quantum gate quantum adiabatic algorithm and quantum error correction potential integer factorization believed computationally infeasible with ordinary computer for large integers they are the product few prime numbers products two digit quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using shor algorithm find its this ability would allow quantum computer decrypt many the cryptographic systems use the sense that there would polynomial time the number digits the algorithm for solving the most the popular public key ciphers are based the difficulty factoring integers the discrete logarithm problem which can both solved particular the rsa diffie hellman and elliptic curve hellman algorithms could these are used protect secure web encrypted and many other types breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and however other cryptographic algorithms not appear broken these some key algorithms are based problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems which algorithm like the mceliece cryptosystem based problem coding theory lattice based cryptosystems are also not known broken quantum and finding polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem which would break many lattice based studied open has been proven that applying algorithm break symmetric secret algorithm brute force requires time equal roughly invocations the underlying cryptographic compared with roughly the classical meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively aes would have the same security against attack using algorithm that has against classical force search see key size quantum cryptography could potentially fulfill some the functions public key besides factorization and discrete quantum algorithms offering more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several including the simulation quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state the approximation jones polynomials and solving pell equation mathematical proof has been found that shows that equally fast classical algorithm cannot although this considered for some quantum computers offer polynomial the most known example this quantum database search which can solved grover algorithm using quadratically fewer queries the database than are required classical this case the advantage several other examples provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been such for finding collisions one functions and evaluating nand consider problem that has these four the only way solve guess answers repeatedly and check the number possible answers check the same the number every possible answer takes the same amount time and there are clues about which answers might generating possibilities randomly just good checking them some special example this password cracker that attempts guess the password for encrypted file assuming that the password has maximum possible for problems with all four the time for quantum computer solve this will proportional the square root the number can used attack symmetric ciphers such triple des and aes attempting guess the secret grover algorithm can also used obtain quadratic over force search for class problems known complete since chemistry and nanotechnology rely understanding quantum and such systems are impossible simulate efficient manner many believe quantum simulation will one the most important applications quantum there are number technical challenges building scale quantum and thus far quantum computers have yet solve problem faster than classical david listed the following requirements for practical quantum scalable physically increase the number qubits can initialized arbitrary quantum gates faster than decoherence time universal gate qubits can read quantum decoherence one the greatest challenges controlling removing quantum decoherence this usually means isolating the system from its environment interactions with the external world cause the system however other sources decoherence also examples include the quantum and the lattice vibrations and background nuclear spin the physical system used implement the decoherence and usually something that should highly not decoherence times for candidate particular the transverse relaxation time for nmr and mri technology also called the dephasing time typically range between nanoseconds and seconds low these issues are more difficult for optical approaches the timescales are orders magnitude shorter and cited approach overcoming them optical pulse shaping error rates are typically proportional the ratio operating time decoherence hence any operation must completed much more quickly than the decoherence the error rate small thought possible use quantum error which corrects errors due thereby allowing the total calculation time longer than the decoherence often cited figure for required error rate each gate this implies that each gate must able perform its task one the decoherence time the meeting this scalability condition possible for wide range however the use error correction brings with the cost greatly increased number required the number required factor integers using algorithm still and thought between and where the number bits the number error correction algorithms would inflate this figure additional factor for bit this implies need for about qubits without error with error the figure would rise about qubits note that computation time about about steps and about seconds very different approach the decoherence problem create topological quantum computer with anyons quasi particles used threads and
