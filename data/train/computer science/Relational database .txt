relational database navigation search this article relies largely entirely upon single source relevant discussion may found the talk page please help improve this article introducing citations additional may relational database database that stores information about both the data and how related relational all data and relationships are represented two dimensional table called for organizations often want store and retrieve information about where they are located and how contact often many people live work variety recording and retrieving them becomes relational databases are good for supporting these kinds the software for relational database called the relational database management system controls writing modifying and processing the information stored the the data formally described and organized according each relational model database schema according the design each database collection related tables each table physical representation entity object that tabular format consisting columns and rows columns are the fields record the attributes the rows contain the values data these are also called records tuples relationships exist both among the columns within table and among the these relationships take three logical one one many many most relational databases are designed there only one value per cell intersection column and this design there are only one relationships within each table named according the data such people order for dbms operate efficiently and must have acid transactions part this processing involves consistently being able select modify one and only one row therefore most physical implementations have unique primary keys for each when new row written the the system generates and writes the unique value for the primary key this the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the system performance optimized for other more natural keys may also identified and defined alternate keys often several columns may needed form this one reason why single integer column usually made the both pks and aks have the ability uniquely identify one row within additional technology may applied that will significantly assure unique across the globally unique identifier these are used when there are broader system the primary keys within database are used define the relationships among the when migrates another becomes foreign key the other when each cell can contain only one value and the migrates into regular entity this design pattern can represent either many most relational database designs resolve many relationships creating additional table that contains the pks from both the other entity the relationship becomes the resolution table then named appropriately and often assigned its own while the two fks are combined form the migration pks other tables the second major reason why assigned integers are used normally there usually neither efficiency nor clarity migrating bunch other types most the programming within rdbms accomplished using stored procedures often procedures can used greatly reduce the amount information transferred within and outside for increased the system design may also grant access only the stored procedures and not directly the fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed insert new data and update existing more complex procedures may written implement additional rules and logic related processing selecting the relational databases tend either significantly normalized normalized databases operational databases tend have better data reduced storage and faster databases are normalized improve often for reporting and making applications larger trend normalized databases may form data marts and warehouses most data warehouses have operational database that used produce the datamarts see normalization below relational databases displaced hierarchical databases because the ability add new relations made possible add new information that was valuable but broke relational hierarchical the trend continues networked planet and social media create the world big which larger and less structured than the datasets and tasks that relational databases handle well instructive compare hadoop contents terminology relations tables base and derived relations domain constraints primary key foreign key stored procedures index relational operations normalization references terminology the relational database was first defined june edgar codd san jose research laboratory codd view what qualifies rdbms summarized codd rules relational database has become the predominant choice storing other models besides the relational model include the hierarchical database model and the network model the table below summarizes some the most important relational database terms and their sql equivalents row tuple record column attribute field table relation base relvar view result set derived relvar query relations tables relation table relation defined set tuples that have the same attributes tuple usually represents object and information about that objects are typically physical objects relation usually described table which organized into rows and columns all the data referenced attribute are the same domain and conform the same the relational model specifies that the tuples relation have specific order and that the impose order the applications access data specifying which use operations such select identify project identify and join combine relations can modified using the insert delete and update operators new tuples can supply explicit values derived from similarly queries identify tuples for updating tuples definition are the tuple contains candidate primary key then obviously however primary key need not defined for row record the definition tuple requires that but does not require primary key because tuple its attributes definition constitute superkey base and derived relations relvar view relational all data are stored and accessed via relations relations that store data are called base and implementations are called tables other relations not store but are computed applying relational operations other these relations are sometimes called derived implementations these are called views queries derived relations are convenient that they act single even though they may grab information from several also derived relations can used abstraction layer domain data domain domain describes the set possible values for given and can considered constraint the value the mathematically attaching domain attribute means that any value for the attribute must element the specified the character string abc for not the integer but the integer value constraints constraints make possible further restrict the domain for constraint can restrict given integer attribute values between and constraints provide one method implementing business rules the sql implements constraint functionality the form check constraints constraints restrict the data that can stored relations these are usually defined using expressions that result boolean value indicating whether not the data satisfies the constraints can apply single tuple restricting combinations entire since every attribute has associated there are constraints domain constraints the two principal rules for the relational model are known entity integrity and referential integrity primary key unique key primary key uniquely specifies tuple within order for attribute good primary key must not while natural attributes attributes used describe the data being are sometimes good primary surrogate keys are often used surrogate key artificial attribute assigned object which uniquely identifies for table information about students school they might all assigned student order differentiate the surrogate key has intrinsic meaning but rather useful through its ability uniquely identify another common especially regard cardinality the composite key composite key key made two more attributes within table that uniquely identify for database relating teachers and classes could uniquely identified composite key their room number and time since other class could have exactly the same combination use composite key such this can form data verification albeit weak foreign key foreign key foreign key field relational table that matches the primary key column another the foreign key can used reference foreign keys need not have unique values the referencing foreign keys effectively use the values attributes the referenced relation restrict the domain one more attributes the referencing foreign key could described formally for all tuples the referencing relation projected over the referencing there must exist tuple the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values each the referencing attributes match the corresponding values the referenced stored procedures stored procedure stored procedure executable code that associated and generally stored the stored procedures usually collect and customize common like inserting tuple into relation gathering statistical information about usage encapsulating complex business logic and frequently they are used application programming interface for security implementations stored procedures sql rdbmss often allow developers take advantage procedural extensions often the standard declarative sql stored procedures are not part the relational database but all commercial implementations include index index index one way providing quicker access indices can created any combination attributes relation queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the without having check each tuple this analogous using the index book directly the page which the information you are looking for that you not have read the entire book find what you are looking relational databases typically supply multiple indexing each which optimal for some combination data relation and typical access indices are usually implemented via trees trees and bitmaps indices are usually not considered part the they are considered implementation though indices are usually maintained the same group that maintains the other parts the should noted that use efficient indexes both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query this because tree indexes result query times proportional where the number rows table and hash indexes result constant time queries size dependency long the relevant part the index fits into relational operations relational algebra queries made against the relational and the derived relvars the database are expressed relational calculus relational algebra his original relational codd introduced eight relational operators two groups four operators the first four operators were based the traditional mathematical set operations the union operator combines the tuples two relations and removes all duplicate tuples from the the relational union operator equivalent the sql union operator the intersection operator produces the set tuples that two relations share intersection implemented sql the form the intersect operator the difference operator acts two relations and produces the set tuples from the first relation that not exist the second difference implemented sql the form the except minus the cartesian product two relations join that not restricted any resulting every tuple the first relation being matched with every tuple the second the cartesian product implemented sql the cross join operator the remaining operators proposed codd involve special operations specific relational the operation retrieves tuples from limiting the results only those that meet specific subset terms set the sql equivalent selection the select query statement with where clause the projection operation extracts only the specified attributes from tuple set the join operation defined for relational databases often referred natural this type two relations are connected their common sql approximation natural join the inner join operator inner join prevents cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables for each table added sql one additional inner join added prevent cartesian thus for tables sql there must inner joins prevent cartesian the relational division operation slightly more complex which involves essentially using the tuples one relation the partition second relation the the relational division operator effectively the opposite the cartesian product operator hence the other operators have been introduced proposed since introduction the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical among normalization database normalization normalization was first proposed codd integral part the relational encompasses set procedures designed eliminate nonsimple domains atomic and the redundancy which turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss data the most common forms normalization applied databases are called the normal forms
