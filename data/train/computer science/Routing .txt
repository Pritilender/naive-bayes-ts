routing navigation search routing router routing the process selecting best paths the the term routing was also used mean forwarding network traffic among however this latter function much better described simply routing performed for many kinds including the telephone network circuit switching electronic data networks such the internet and transportation networks this article concerned primarily with routing electronic data networks using packet switching technology packet switching routing directs packet forwarding the transit logically addressed network packets from their source toward their ultimate through intermediate nodes intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such routers bridges gateways firewalls switches general purpose computers can also forward packets and perform though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited the routing process usually directs forwarding the basis routing tables which maintain record the routes various network thus constructing routing which are held the memory very important for efficient most routing algorithms use only one network path multipath routing techniques enable the use multiple alternative case equal the following elements are considered order decide which routes get installed into the routing table sorted prefix length where longer subnet masks are preferred independent whether within routing protocol over different routing metric where lower cost preferred only valid within one and the same routing administrative distance where lower distance preferred only valid between different routing routing more narrow sense the often contrasted with bridging its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the structured addresses allow single routing table entry represent the route group large structured addressing the narrow outperforms unstructured addressing routing has become the dominant form

routing adaptive small networks may use manually configured routing larger networks have complex topologies that can change making the manual construction routing tables nevertheless most the public switched telephone network uses computed routing with fallback routes the most direct route becomes blocked see routing the pstn adaptive routing dynamic attempts solve this problem constructing routing tables based information carried routing protocols allowing the network act nearly autonomously avoiding network failures and examples routing algorithms are the routing information protocol rip and the first protocol ospf adaptive routing dominates the however the configuration the routing protocols often requires skilled networking technology has not developed the point the complete automation citation needed distance vector algorithms distance vector routing protocol distance vector algorithms use the bellman ford algorithm this approach assigns cost number each the links between each node the nodes will send information from point point via the path that results the lowest total cost the sum the costs the links between the nodes the algorithm operates very simple when node first only knows its immediate and the direct cost involved reaching this information the list the total cost and the next hop send data get there makes the routing distance table each regular sends each neighbour node its own current assessment the total cost get all the destinations knows the neighbouring nodes examine this information and compare what they already anything that represents improvement what they already they insert their own routing over all the nodes the network will discover the best next hop for all and the best total when one network node goes any nodes that used their next hop discard the and create new table these nodes convey the updated routing information all adjacent which turn repeat the eventually all the nodes the network receive the and discover new paths all the destinations they can still reach ripv link state algorithms link state routing protocol when applying state graphical map the network the fundamental data used for each produce its each node floods the entire network with information about the other nodes can connect each node then independently assembles this information into using this each router independently determines the cost path from itself every other node using standard shortest paths algorithm such dijkstra algorithm the result tree graph rooted the current such that the path through the tree from the root any other node the cost path that this tree then serves construct the routing which specifies the best next hop get from the current node any other optimised link state routing algorithm optimized link state routing protocol state routing algorithm optimised for mobile hoc networks the optimised link state routing protocol olsr uses hello and topology control messages discover and disseminate link state information through the mobile hoc network using hello each node discovers hop neighbor information and elects set multipoint relays mprs distinguish olsr from other link state routing path vector protocol path vector protocol distance vector and link state routing are both domain routing they are used inside autonomous system but not between autonomous both these routing protocols become intractable large networks and cannot used inter domain routing distance vector routing subject instability there are more than few hops the link state routing needs huge amount resources calculate routing also creates heavy traffic due path vector routing used for domain similar distance vector path vector routing assume there one node there can each autonomous system which acts behalf the entire autonomous this node called the speaker the speaker node creates routing table and advertises neighboring speaker nodes neighboring autonomous the idea the same distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes each autonomous system can communicate with each the speaker node advertises the not the metric the its autonomous system other autonomous path vector routing discussed rfc the path vector routing algorithm somewhat similar the distance vector algorithm the sense that each border router advertises the destinations can reach its neighboring however instead advertising networks terms destination and the distance that networks are advertised destination addresses and path descriptions reach those route defined pairing between destination and the attributes the path that thus the path vector where the routers receive vector that contains paths set the expressed terms the domains traversed carried special path attribute that records the sequence routing domains through which the reachability information has path selection path selection involves applying routing metric multiple order select the best computer the metric computed routing and can cover information such bandwidth network delay hop count path load mtu reliability and communication cost see this survey for list proposed routing the routing table stores only the best possible while link state topological databases may store all other information because routing metric specific given routing multi protocol routers must use some external heuristic order select between routes learned from different routing cisco routers for attribute value known the administrative distance each where smaller administrative distances indicate routes learned from supposedly more reliable local network special can set specific routes particular device which provides more control over network permits testing and better overall this can come handy when debugging network connections routing multiple agents some routing complicated the fact that single entity responsible for selecting instead multiple entities are involved selecting paths even parts single complications inefficiency can result these entities choose paths optimize their own which may conflict with the objectives other classic example involves traffic road which each driver picks path which minimizes their own travel with such the equilibrium routes can longer than optimal for all braess paradox shows that adding new road can lengthen travel times for all another for used for routing automated guided vehicles reservations are made for each vehicle prevent simultaneous use the same part this approach also referred aware the internet partitioned into autonomous systems such internet service providers each which has control over routes involving its multiple first level paths are selected via the bgp protocol which produces sequence ass through which packets will each may have multiple offered neighboring from which its decision often involves business relationships with these neighboring which may unrelated path quality second once level path has been there are often multiple corresponding level part because two isps may connected multiple choosing the single level common practice for each isp employ hot potato routing sending traffic along the path that minimizes the distance through the own even that path lengthens the total distance the consider two and which each have presence new york connected fast link with latency and which each have presence london connected suppose both isps have atlantic links connecting their two but link has latency and has latency when routing message from source london network destination new york may choose immediately send the message this saves the work sending along expensive atlantic but causes the message experience latency when the other route would have been measurement study internet routes found between pairs neighboring more than paths have inflated latency due potato with paths being delayed least inflation due level path while was attributed primarily lack mechanism directly optimize for rather than selfish routing was also suggested were appropriate mechanism isps would willing cooperate reduce latency rather than use potato such mechanism was later published the same first for the case two isps and then for the global route analytics the internet and networks become mission critical business there has been increased interest techniques and methods monitor the routing posture incorrect
