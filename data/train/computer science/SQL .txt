structured query language special purpose programming language designed for managing data held relational database management system originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus sql consists data definition language and data manipulation language the scope sql includes data query update and schema creation and and data access although sql often described and great extent declarative language also includes procedural elements sql was one the first commercial languages for edgar codd relational model described his influential paper relational model data for large shared data despite not entirely adhering the relational model described codd became the most widely used database sql became standard the american national standards institute and the international organization for standardization since the standard has been enhanced several times with added despite these code not completely portable among different database which can lead vendor the different makers not perfectly adhere the for instance adding and the standard itself sometimes contents history syntax language elements operators conditional expressions queries subqueries null and valued

see also notes references external links history sql was initially developed ibm donald chamberlin and raymond boyce the early this initially called sequel structured english query language was designed manipulate and retrieve data stored original relational database management system which group ibm san jose research laboratory had developed during the the acronym sequel was later changed sql because sequel was trademark the based hawker siddeley aircraft the late relational inc now oracle corporation saw the potential the concepts described chamberlin and boyce and developed their own based rdbms with aspirations selling the navy central intelligence agency and other government agencies june relational inc introduced the first commercially available implementation oracle for vax computers after testing sql customer test sites determine the usefulness and practicality the ibm began developing commercial products based their system prototype including sql and which were commercially available and respectively syntax language elements the sql language subdivided into several language including clauses which are constituent components statements and some these are expressions which can produce either scalar values tables consisting columns and rows data predicates which specify conditions that can evaluated sql three valued logic boolean truth values and are used limit the effects statements and change program queries which retrieve the data based specific this important element sql statements which may have persistent effect schemata and may control transactions program connections sessions sql statements also include the semicolon statement though not required every defined standard part the sql insignificant whitespace generally ignored sql statements and making easier format sql code for operators author dept hire date bonus dependants rate between cost between and like name like deptcode not address not null not distinct from debt not distinct from receivables select employee conditional expressions sql has the expression which was introduced sql its most general which called searched the sql works like else other programming case when then when then else end sql tests conditions the order they appear the the source does not specify expression sql defaults abbreviated called simple the sql mirrors switch statements case when then when then else cannot count that end this syntax uses implicit equality with the usual caveats for comparing with null for the sql the latter can shortened equivalent construct select decode cannot count that from the last value the none also defaults however unlike the simple oracle considers two equal with each queries the most common operation sql the which performed with the declarative select statement retrieves data from one more tables standard statements have persistent effects the some standard implementations can have persistent such the syntax that exists some queries allow the user describe desired leaving the database management system responsible for planning optimizing and performing the physical operations necessary produce that result query includes list columns include the final immediately following the keyword asterisk can also used specify that the query should return all columns the queried the most complex statement with optional keywords and clauses that the from clause which indicates the retrieve data the clause can include optional join subclauses specify the rules for joining the where clause includes comparison which restricts the rows returned the the clause eliminates all rows from the result set where the comparison predicate does not evaluate the clause used project rows having common values into smaller set often used conjunction with sql aggregation functions eliminate duplicate rows from result the clause applied before the clause the having clause includes predicate used filter rows resulting from the clause because acts the results the clause aggregation functions can used the clause the order clause identifies which columns use sort the resulting and which direction sort them ascending without clause the order rows returned sql query the following example query that returns list expensive the query retrieves all rows from the book table which the price column contains value greater than the result sorted ascending order title the asterisk the select list indicates that all columns the book table should included the result select from where order the example below demonstrates query multiple grouping and returning list books and the number authors associated with each select count from join group example output might resemble the under the precondition that isbn the only common column name the two tables and that column named title only exists the books table the above query could rewritten the following select count from natural join group many vendors either not support this require certain column naming conventions for natural joins work sql includes operators and functions for calculating values stored sql allows the use expressions the select list project the following which returns list books that cost more than with additional sales tax column containing sales tax figure calculated the price select from where order subqueries queries can nested that the results one query can used another query via relational operator aggregation nested query also known subquery while joins and other table operations provide computationally superior faster alternatives many the use subqueries introduces hierarchy execution that can useful the following the aggregation function receives input the result select from where select from order subquery can use values from the outer which case known correlated subquery since the sql standard allows named subqueries called common table expression named and designed after the ibm version implementation oracle calls these subquery factoring ctes can also recursive referring the resulting mechanism allows tree graph traversals when represented and more generally fixpoint computations null and valued logic null the concept null was introduced into sql handle missing information the relational the word reserved keyword used identify the null special comparisons with for instance equality where results unknown truth select statements sql returns only results for which the where clause returns value excludes results with values false and also excludes those whose value along with true and the unknown resulting from direct comparisons with null thus brings fragment three valued logic the truth tables sql uses for and not correspond common fragment the kleene and lukasiewicz valued logic which differ their definition however sql defines such there are however disputes about the semantic interpretation nulls sql because its treatment outside direct seen the table above direct equality comparisons between two nulls sql returns truth value this line with the interpretation that null does not have value and not member any data but rather placeholder mark for missing however the principle that two nulls equal each other effectively violated the sql specification for the and operators which identify nulls with each consequently these set operations sql may produce results not representing sure unlike operations involving explicit comparisons with null those clause discussed proposal which was basically adopted this semantic inconsistency rationalized arguing that removal duplicates set operations happens lower level detail than equality testing the evaluation retrieval however computer science professor ron van der meyden concluded that the inconsistencies the sql standard mean that not possible ascribe any intuitive logical semantics the treatment nulls additionally since sql operators return unknown when comparing anything with null sql provides two specific comparison and test whether data not universal quantification not explicitly supported and must worked out negated existential quantification there also the row value distinct from row value infixed comparison which returns true unless both operands are equal both are likewise not distinct from defined not row value distinct from row value sql also introduced type which according the standard can also hold unknown number systems postgresql implement the boolean unknown boolean data manipulation the data manipulation language the subset sql used update and delete insert adds rows formally tuples existing insert into values null update modifies set existing table update set updated where delete removes existing rows from delete from where merge used combine the data multiple combines the and elements defined the standard prior some databases provided similar functionality via different sometimes called upsert merge into name using when then update set when not then insert values transaction controls transactions wrap dml depending sql marks the start database transaction which either completes entirely not saves the state the database the current point transaction create table int insert into values insert into values update set where savepoint update set where rollback select from commit makes all data changes transaction rollback discards all data changes since the last leaving the data was prior those once the statement the changes cannot rolled and terminate the current transaction and release data the absence similar the semantics sql are the following example shows classic transfer funds where money removed from one account and added either the removal the addition the entire transaction rolled start transaction update set where update set where rollback data definition the data definition language manages table and index the most basic items ddl are the and statements create creates object for the create table integer varchar date not null primary key alter modifies the structure existing object various for adding column existing table alter table add number not null truncate deletes all data from table very fast deleting the data inside the table and not the table usually implies subsequent commit cannot rolled back data not written the logs for rollback unlike truncate table drop deletes object the usually cannot rolled drop table data types each column sql table declares the that column may ansi sql includes the following data character strings fixed width character padded with spaces needed variable width string with maximum size characters fixed width string supporting international character set variable width string bit strings array bits array bits numbers and and for the number has precision and scale the positive integer that determines the number significant digits particular radix binary the negative scale indicates that the number for decimal number with scale the exact numeric value the integer value the significant digits divided sql provides function round numerics called postgresql oracle and sqlite sybase oracle postgresql and microsoft sql date and time for date values for time values the granularity the time value usually tick nanoseconds the same but including details about the time zone this and put together one variable the same but including details about the time zone sql provides several functions for generating date time variable out date time string well for extracting the respective members for such the current system date time the database server can called using functions like data control the data control language authorizes users access and manipulate its two main statements authorizes one more users perform operation set operations eliminates which may the

functions wide variety including perl python tcl and criticism sql deviates several ways from its theoretical the relational model and its tuple calculus that table set while tables and query results are lists the same row may occur multiple and the order rows can employed queries the limit whether this common practical concern subject furthermore additional features such null and were introduced without founding them directly the relational which makes them more difficult critics argue that sql should replaced with language that strictly returns the original for see the third manifesto other critics suggest that datalog has two advantages over has cleaner which facilitates program understanding and and more particular for recursive another criticism that sql implementations are incompatible between particular date and time string and comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor particular exception postgresql which strives for popular implementations sql commonly omit support for basic features standard such the data the most obvious such and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary sql are oracle whose behaves and lacks type and sql server before the version sql code can rarely ported between database systems without there are several reasons for this lack portability between database the complexity and size the sql standard means that most implementors not support the entire the standard does not specify database behavior several important areas indexes file leaving implementations decide how the sql standard precisely specifies the syntax that conforming database system must however the specification the semantics language constructs less leading many database vendors have large existing customer where the sql standard conflicts with the prior behavior the the vendor may unwilling break backward compatibility there little commercial incentive for vendors make easier for users change database suppliers see vendor users evaluating database software tend place other factors such performance higher their priorities than standards standardization sql was adopted standard the american national standards institute and the
