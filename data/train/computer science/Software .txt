september computer software simply software also known computer programs the tangible component computers computer software contrasts with computer hardware which the physical component computer hardware and software require each other and neither can realistically used without the computer software includes all computer programs regardless their for executable files libraries and scripts are computer yet shares their mutual software consists clearly defined instructions that upon instructs hardware perform the tasks for which software stored computer memory and cannot just model shown illustration cannot the lowest executable code consists machine language instructions specific individual processor typically central processing unit machine language consists groups binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state the computer from its preceding for instruction may change the value stored particular storage location inside the computer effect that not directly observable the instruction may also cause something appear display the computer system state change which should visible the the processor carries out the instructions the order they are unless instructed jump different software usually written high level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans use closer natural language than machine high level languages are compiled interpreted into machine language object software may also written level assembly language essentially vaguely mnemonic representation machine language using natural language assembly language converted into object code via assembler contents history types software purpose domain use nature domain execution programming tools software topics architecture execution quality and reliability license patents design and implementation industry and organizations see also references external links history history software types software list software categories operating system application software desktop computer virtually all computer software can grouped into few broad purpose domain use based the computer software can divided application software uses the computer system perform useful work provide entertainment functions beyond the basic operation the computer system software designed operate the computer hardware provide basic and provide platform for running application system software operating system essential collection computer programs that manages resources and provides common services for other supervisory programs boot loaders shells and window systems are core parts operating operating system comes bundled with additional software including application that user can potentially some work with computer that only has operating device driver computer program that operates controls particular type device that attached each device needs least one corresponding device thus computer needs more than one device utilities software designed assist users maintenance and care their malicious software malware computer software developed harm and disrupt malware malware closely associated with related though some malicious programs may have been designed practical jokes nature domain execution desktop applications such web browsers and microsoft office well smartphone and tablet applications called apps server software scripts such javascript scripts are pieces software traditionally embedded web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when web page without the need for web browser software written other programming languages can also run within the web browser the software either translated into web browser plugin that supports that language the most common example the latter actionscript scripts which are supported the adobe flash plugin web applications usually run the web server and output dynamically generated web pages web using php java asp net even javascript that runs the server modern times these commonly include some javascript run the web browser which case they typically run partly the partly the web plugins and extensions are software that extends modifies the functionality another piece and require that software used order embedded software resides firmware within embedded systems devices dedicated single use few uses such cars and televisions although some embedded devices such wireless chipsets can themselves part non embedded computer system such smartphone the embedded system context there sometimes clear distinction between the system software and the application however some embedded systems run embedded operating systems and these systems retain the distinction between system software and application software although typically there will only fixed application which always microcode relatively obscure type embedded software which tells the processor itself how execute machine actually lower level than machine typically proprietary the processor and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied them users which much cheaper than shipping replacement processor thus ordinary programmer would not expect ever have deal with programming tools programming tool programming tools are software the form programs applications that software developers also known programmers coders hackers software engineers use debug maintain improve otherwise support software software written one more programming there are many programming languages and each has least one each which consists its own set programming these tools may relatively contained programs such compilers debuggers interpreters linkers and text editors that can combined together accomplish they may form integrated development environment which combines much all the functionality such contained ides may this either invoking the relevant individual tools implementing their functionality new ide can make easier specific such searching files particular many programming language implementations provide the option using both individual tools software topics architecture software architecture users often see things differently than people who use modern general purpose computers opposed embedded systems analog computers and supercomputers usually see three layers software performing variety platform application and user platform platform includes the firmware device drivers operating system and typically graphical user interface which allow user interact with the computer and its peripherals associated platform software often comes bundled with the one will usually have the ability change the platform application application software applications are what most people think when they think typical examples include office suites and video application software often purchased separately from computer sometimes applications are bundled with the but that does not change the fact that they run independent applications are usually independent programs from the operating though they are often tailored for specific most users think databases and other system user written end user development tailors systems meet specific user software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates even email filters are kind user users create this software themselves and often overlook how important depending how competently the written software has been integrated into default application many users may not aware the distinction between the original and what has been added execution execution computer software has loaded into the computer storage such the hard drive memory once the software has the computer able execute the this involves passing instructions from the application software through the system the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction machine code each instruction causes the computer carry out moving data carrying out computation altering the control flow data movement typically from one place memory sometimes involves moving data between memory and registers which enable speed data access the moving especially large amounts can this sometimes avoided using pointers data computations include simple operations such incrementing the value variable data more complex computations may involve many operations and data elements quality and reliability software quality software testing software reliability software quality very especially for commercial and system software like microsoft office microsoft windows and linux software faulty can delete crash the computer and other unexpected faults and errors are called bugs software often also victim what known software aging the progressive performance degradation resulting from combination unseen many bugs are discovered and eliminated through software testing however software testing eliminates every some programmers say that every program has least one more citation needed all major software such novell and sun microsystems have their own software testing departments with the specific goal just software can tested through unit testing regression testing and other which are done most automatically since the amount code tested can quite for nasa has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication many based operations interact and identify each other through command programs called this enables many people who work nasa check and evaluate functional systems programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations function much easier license software license the license gives the user the right use the software the licensed some software comes with the license when purchased off the oem license when bundled with other software comes with free software license granting the recipient the rights modify and redistribute the software can also the form freeware shareware patents software patent software patent debate software can patented some but not all however software patents can controversial the software industry with many people holding different views about the controversy over software patents about specific algorithms techniques that the software which may not duplicated others and considered intellectual property and copyright infringement depending the design and implementation software development computer programming software engineering design and implementation software varies depending the complexity the for design and creation microsoft word software will take much more time than designing and developing microsoft notepad because the difference functionalities each software usually designed and created integrated development environments like eclipse emacs and microsoft visual studio that can simplify the process and compile the noted different software usually created top existing software and the application programming interface that the underlying software provides like gtk javabeans swing libraries are categorized for different for javabeans library used for designing enterprise applications windows forms library used for designing graphical user interface applications like microsoft word and windows communication foundation used for designing web services underlying computer programming concepts like quicksort hash table array and binary tree can useful creating when program relies the for user designing microsoft windows desktop she might use the net windows forms library design the desktop application and call its apis like form and form close open the application and write the additional operations herself that need without these the programmer needs write these apis companies like sun microsystems novell and microsoft provide their own apis that many applications are written using their software libraries that usually have numerous apis computer software has special economic characteristics that make its creation and distribution different from most other economic specify person who creates software called programmer software engineer software developer terms that all have similar industry and organizations software industry great variety software companies and programmers the world comprise software software can quite profitable bill gates the founder microsoft was the richest person the world largely selling the microsoft windows and microsoft office software the same goes for larry ellison largely through his oracle database software through time the software industry has become increasingly non profit software organizations include the free software foundation gnu project and mozilla foundation software standard organizations like the ietf develop software standards that most software can interoperate through standards such xml html http ftp other known large software companies include novell sap symantec adobe systems and corel while small companies often provide see
