references further reading maximum throughput peak information rate users telecommunications systems and researchers into communication theory are often interested knowing the expected performance from user this often phrased either which device will get data there most effectively for which device will deliver the most data per unit systems designers are often interested selecting the most effective architecture design constraints for which drive its final most the benchmark what system capable its maximum what the user designer interested when examining the term maximum throughput frequently used where user maximum throughput tests are discussed maximum throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth capacity four different values have meaning the context maximum used comparing the upper conceptual performance multiple they are maximum theoretical maximum achievable and peak measured and maximum sustained these represent different quantities and care must taken that the same definitions are used when comparing different maximum values comparing throughput values also dependent each bit carrying the same amount data compression can significantly skew throughput including generating values greater than the communication mediated several links series with different bit the maximum throughput the overall link lower than equal the lowest bit the lowest value link the series referred the bottleneck maximum theoretical throughput this number closely related the channel capacity the and the maximum possible quantity data that can transmitted under ideal some cases this number reported equal the channel though this can only packetized systems technologies can achieve this without data maximum theoretical throughput more accurately reported take into account format and specification overhead with best case this like the closely related term maximum achievable below primarily used rough calculated such for determining bounds possible performance early system design peak measured throughput the above values are theoretical peak measured throughput throughput measured implemented simulated the value the throughput measured over short period mathematically this the limit taken with respect throughput time approaches this term synonymous with instantaneous throughput this number useful for systems that rely burst data however for systems with high duty cycle this less likely useful measure system maximum sustained throughput this value the throughput averaged integrated over long time sometimes considered for high duty cycle networks this likely the most accurate indicator system the maximum throughput defined the asymptotic throughput when the load the amount incoming very packet switched systems where the load and the throughput always are equal where packet loss does not the maximum throughput may defined the minimum load that causes the delivery time the become unstable and increase towards this value can also used deceptively relation peak measured throughput conceal packet shaping channel utilization and efficiency throughput sometimes normalized and measured but normalization may cause confusion regarding what the percentage related channel utilization channel efficiency and packet drop rate percentage are less ambiguous the channel efficiency also known bandwidth utilization efficiency percentage the achieved throughput related the net bitrate digital communication channel for the throughput mbit mbit ethernet the channel efficiency this effective mbits data are transmitted every channel utilization instead term related the use the channel disregarding the counts not only with the data bits but also with the overhead that makes use the the transmission overhead consists preamble frame headers and acknowledge the definitions assume noiseless otherwise the throughput would not only associated the nature the protocol but also retransmissions resultant from quality the simplistic channel efficiency can equal channel utilization assuming that acknowledge packets are length and that the communications provider will not see any bandwidth relative retransmissions therefore certain texts mark difference between channel utilization and protocol point point multipoint communication link where only one terminal the maximum throughput often equivalent very near the physical data rate the channel capacity since the channel utilization can almost such except for small frame for ethernet the maximum frame size bytes maximum byte payload byte preamble byte header byte additional minimum interframe gap corresponding byte inserted after each this corresponds maximum channel utilization maximum channel use mbit inclusive ethernet datalink layer protocol overhead mbit ethernet the maximum throughput channel efficiency then mbit exclusive ethernet protocol factors affecting throughput the throughput communication system will limited huge number some these are described analog limitations the maximum achievable throughput the channel affected the bandwidth hertz and noise ratio the analog physical despite the conceptual simplicity digital all electrical signals traveling over wires are the analog limitations wires wireless systems inevitably provide upper bound the amount information that can the dominant equation here the shannon hartley theorem and analog limitations this type can understood factors that affect either the analog bandwidth signal factors that affect the signal noise should noted that the bandwidth wired systems can fact surprisingly with the bandwidth ethernet wire limited approximately and pcb traces limited similar digital systems refer the knee the amount time for the digital voltage rise from nominal digital nominal digital the knee frequency related the required bandwidth and can related the bandwidth system the where the rise and constant proportionality related the pulse equal for exponential and for gaussian wires have inherent and inherent capacitance when measured with respect this leads effects called parasitic capacitance causing all wires and cables act lowpass skin effect frequency electric charges migrate the edges wires this reduces the effective cross sectional area available for carrying increasing resistance and reducing the signal noise for awg wire the type commonly found cat cable the skin effect frequency becomes dominant over the inherent resistivity the wire ghz the resistivity has increased ohms termination and for long wires wires longer than wavelengths can considered must modeled transmission lines and take termination into unless this reflected signals will travel back and forth across the positively negatively interfering with the carrying wireless channel effects for wireless all the effects associated with wireless transmission limit the snr and bandwidth the received and therefore the maximum number bits that can hardware considerations computational systems have finite processing and can drive finite limited current drive capability can limit the effective signal noise ratio for high capacitance links large data loads that require processing impose data processing requirements hardware such for gateway router supporting populated class subnet handling mbit ethernet must examine bits address determine the destination port for each this translates into packets per second assuming maximum data payload per with table addresses this requires the router able perform billion lookup operations per worse case where the payloads each ethernet packet are reduced bytes this number operations per second jumps billion this router would require teraflop processing core able handle such csma and csma backoff waiting time and frame retransmissions after detected this may occur ethernet bus networks and hub well wireless flow control for example the transmission control protocol protocol affects the throughput the bandwidth delay product larger than the tcp the buffer that case the sending computer must wait for acknowledgement the data packets before can send more tcp congestion avoidance controls the data called slow occurs the beginning file and after packet drops caused router congestion bit errors for example wireless multi user considerations ensuring that multiple users can harmoniously share single communications link requires some kind equitable sharing the bottle neck communication link offering data rate shared active users with least one data packet every user typically achieves throughput approximately fair queuing best effort communication packet loss due network congestion packets may dropped switches and routers when the packet queues are full due packet loss due bit errors scheduling algorithms routers and fair queuing not users that send large packets will get higher some users may prioritized weighted fair queuing algorithm differentiated guaranteed quality service some communications such satellite only finite number channels may available given user given channels are assigned either through preassignment through demand assigned multiple access these throughput quantized per and unused capacity partially utilized channels goodput and overhead goodput the maximum throughput often unreliable measurement perceived for example the file transmission data rate bits per pointed out
