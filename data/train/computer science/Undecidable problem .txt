computer science	undecidable problem navigation search computability theory and computational complexity theory undecidable problem decision problem for which known impossible construct single algorithm that always leads correct decision problem any arbitrary question infinite set because traditional define the decision problem equivalently the set inputs for which the problem returns yes these inputs can natural but also other values some other such strings formal language using some such del numbering the strings can encoded natural thus decision problem informally phrased terms formal language also equivalent set natural numbers keep the formal definition phrased terms subsets the natural formally decision problem subset the natural the corresponding informal problem that deciding whether given number the decision problem called decidable effectively solvable recursive set problem called partially semi decidable solvable provable recursively enumerable set this means that there exists algorithm that halts eventually when the answer yes but may run for ever the answer partially decidable problems and any other problems that are not decidable are called contents computability theory relationship with incompleteness theorem examples undecidable problems examples undecidable statements see also references computability theory computability theory the halting problem decision problem which can stated program alan turing proved that general algorithm running turing machine that solves the halting problem for all possible input pairs necessarily cannot hence the halting problem undecidable for turing relationship with incompleteness theorem the concepts raised incompleteness theorems are very similar those raised the halting and the proofs are quite weaker form the first incompleteness theorem easy consequence the undecidability the halting this weaker form differs from the standard statement the incompleteness theorem asserting that consistent and sound axiomatization all statements about natural numbers the sound part the means that require the axiomatic system question prove only true statements about natural important observe that the statement the standard form first incompleteness theorem completely unconcerned with the question but only concerns the issue whether can proven the weaker form the theorem can proved from the undecidability the halting problem assume that have consistent and complete axiomatization all true first order logic statements about natural numbers then can build algorithm that enumerates all these this means that there algorithm that given natural number computes true order logic statement about natural numbers such for all the true there least one such that yields that now suppose want decide the algorithm with representation halts input know that this statement can expressed with order logic say since the axiomatization complete follows that either there such that there such that iterate over all until either find its will always this means that this gives algorithm decide the halting since know that there cannot such follows that the assumption that there consistent and complete axiomatization all true order logic statements about natural numbers must examples undecidable problems list undecidable problems undecidable problems can related different such logic abstract machines topology note that since there are uncountably many undecidable any even one infinite length necessarily examples undecidable statements there are two distinct senses the word undecidable contemporary the first these the sense used relation that statement being neither provable nor refutable specified deductive system the second sense used relation computability theory and applies not statements but decision problems which are countably infinite sets questions each requiring yes such problem said undecidable there computable function that correctly answers every question the problem the connection between these two that decision problem undecidable the recursion theoretical then there effective formal system which proves for every question the problem either the answer the answer because the two meanings the word the term independent sometimes used instead undecidable for the neither provable nor sense the usage independent also however can mean just not leaving open whether independent statement might undecidability statement particular deductive system does and address the question whether the truth value the statement whether can determined other undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth falsity the whether there exist called absolutely statements whose truth value can never known controversial point among various philosophical schools one the first problems suspected the second sense the was the word problem for groups first posed max dehn which asks there finitely presented group for which algorithm exists determine whether two words are this was shown the case the combined work del and paul cohen has given two concrete examples undecidable statements the first sense the the continuum hypothesis can neither proved nor refuted zfc the standard axiomatization set theory and the axiom choice can neither proved nor refuted which all the zfc axioms except the axiom these results not require the incompleteness del proved that neither these statements could disproved zfc set the cohen proved that neither provable from and the continuum hypothesis cannot proven from russian mathematician yuri matiyasevich showed that hilbert tenth problem posed challenge the next century cannot hilbert challenge sought algorithm which finds all solutions diophantine equation diophantine equation more general case fermat last theorem seek the integer roots polynomial any number variables with integer since have only one equation but variables infinitely many solutions exist and are easy the complex plane the problem becomes difficult constraining solutions integer values matiyasevich showed this problem unsolvable mapping diophantine equation recursively enumerable set and invoking incompleteness alan turing proved that the halting problem the question whether not turing machine halts given the second sense the this result was later generalized rice theorem the whitehead problem group theory was shown the first sense the standard set paris and harrington proved that the paris harrington principle version the ramsey theorem undecidable the axiomatization arithmetic given the peano axioms but can proven true the larger system second order arithmetic kruskal tree theorem which has applications computer also undecidable from the peano axioms but provable set fact tree theorem its finite undecidable much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable basis philosophy mathematics called goodstein theorem statement about the ramsey theory the natural numbers that kirby and paris showed undecidable peano gregory chaitin produced undecidable statements algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem that chaitin theorem states that for any theory that can represent enough there upper bound such that specific number can proven that theory have kolmogorov complexity greater than while theorem related the liar paradox chaitin result related berry paradox researchers kurtz and building earlier work conway the proved that natural generalization the collatz problem see also
