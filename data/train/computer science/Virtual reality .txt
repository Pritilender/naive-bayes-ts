control the image that the viewer appears inside the scene with the action going all the computer presents the view which corresponds the direction the viewer through system this would give the viewers the feeling that they are actually going the scene person instead looking pictures the term virtual has been suggested more specific for this which described detail the article virtual space the movies the future the term artificial reality coined myron krueger has been use since the however the origin the term virtual can traced back the french poet actor and director antonin artaud his seminal book the theatre and its double artaud described theatre virtuelle virtual reality erik objects and images take the phantasmagoric force visionary internal artaud claimed that the perpetual allusion the materials and the principle the theater found almost all alchemical books should understood the expression identity existing between the world which the images and general way all that constitutes the virtual reality the theater and the purely fictitious and illusory world which the symbols alchemy are the term has also been used the judas mandala science fiction novel damien

can incorporated into several virtual reality head mounted displays were released for gaming during the mid these included the virtual boy developed nintendo the iglasses developed virtual the cybermaxx developed victormaxx and the developed forte technologies and then there was virtuality and countless number narrow systems video arcades for flight and shooter games which are still thriving the these arcade games only simulate certain aspects reality and therefore other modern examples narrow for gaming include the wii remote the kinect and the playstation move playstation eye all which track and send motion input the players the game console somewhat there also new high field view headset system development designed specifically for gaming called the oculus rift the headset provides approximately degree field absolute head orientation usb interface and with the consumer version aimed resolution greater development kit and here the list games with oculus rift support there has also been recent development oriented omnidirectional treadmills because oculus rift such virtuix omni and cyberith virtualizer which can simulate the motion walking stationary these devices not take the entire room nor they have ropes any other bulky accessories unlike its other examples include technologies simple and common mmorpg where players interact online virtual worlds means sony announced their rival the oculus rift technology the prototype project morpheus the game developers conference during march features head mounted display with resolution and degree field accompanied accelerometer and gyroscope sensors built into the head mounted unit and employs the playstation camera track head orientation and that the head the image the virtual world rotates accordingly the technology also designed work conjunction with the playstation move and dualshock controllers music immersive virtual musical instruments build the trend electronic musical instruments develop new ways control sound and perform music such evidenced conferences like nime and aim represent musical events and sound parameters virtual reality such way that they can perceived not only through auditory but also visually and possibly through tactile well haptic allowing the development novel interaction metaphors beyond manipulation such the second music video take song the norwegian

application various forms exposure ranging from phobia treatments newer approaches treating ptsd very basic simulation with simple sight and sound models has been shown invaluable phobia like zoophobia and acrophobia step between basic exposure therapy such the use simulacra and true much more recent application being piloted the navy use much more complex simulation immerse veterans suffering from ptsd simulations urban combat much phobia exposure the subject the trauma fear leads desensitization and significant reduction other research fields which the use virtual reality being

rehabilitation for individuals recovering from stroke spinal cord the use virtual reality being evaluated promote movement navigational social skills children with cerebral palsy acquired brain injury other citation needed research evidence emerging rapidly the field virtual reality for therapeutic number recent reviews published reviewed journals have summarized the current evidence for the use virtual reality within pediatric and adult one such review concluded that the field potentially the new field virtual rehabilitation has emerged there has also been talks letting physical therapist use work with patients who are another they could use multiple cameras project avatar the therapist who can then guide the patient throughout the haptic devices can also used for the doctor feel the conditions the however transfer the required information support real time far too slow the training the usage training perspective allow professionals conduct training virtual environment where they can improve upon their skills without the consequence failing the plays important role combat training for the allows the recruits train under controlled environment where they are respond different types combat fully immersive virtual reality that uses head mounted display data data and weapon are used train for this setup allows the reset time cut and allows more repetition shorter amount the fully immersive training environment allows the soldiers train through wide variety situations and also used flight simulation for the air force where people are trained the simulator would sit top hydraulic lift system that reacts the user inputs and when the pilot steer the the module would turn and tilt accordingly provide haptic feedback the flight simulator can range from fully enclosed module series computer monitors providing the point the most important reasons using simulators over learning with real aircraft are the reduction transference time between land training and real the economy and absence the same virtual driving simulations are used train tank drivers the basics before allowing them operate the real the same goes for driving which belgian firemen are for example trained drive way that prevents much damage these drivers often have less experience than other truck virtual reality training allows them compensate the near similar projects are expected for all drivers priority including the medical personnel are able train through deal with wider variety experiment was performed sixteen surgical residents where eight them went through laparoscopic cholecystectomy through they then came out faster gallbladder dissection than the controlled implementation develop real time virtual computer graphics library can used embedded resource coupled with common programming language such perl java python some the most popular computer graphic libraries are opengl direct java and vrml and their use are directly influenced the system demands terms

which can for the laboratory mlad boleslav beyond modeling assembly computer graphics techniques are currently used the research and development medical devices for therapies treatments patient and early diagnoses complex urban design virtual reality becoming widely used for urban regeneration and planning and transport development began virtual reality software which took design coordinate geometry used land surveyors and civil engineers and incorporated precision spatial information created automatically the lines and curves typically shown subdivision plats and land surveying these precise spatial areas cross referenced color and texture item the item list contained set controls for rendering such water reflective surface building the land surface software create contour map uses digital terrain model prototype software was developed for the core technology automate the process leading from design the first beta users were able press single function and automatically drape the design survey data over the digital terrain create data structures that are passed into video gaming engine create virtual interactive world showing massing see picture buildings relation man made was the first application where virtual reality was made effortless for urban planning principals using technology video that most people under years old are familiar with the software was improved implement massing models from other free commercially sold software create more realistic virtual reality with very little time and effort see the below the software marketed landmentor and
