not only provided their audience with brief respite from they also gave them accurate but not too detailed picture this led ancient critic ask life influenced menander the writing his plays was vice unlike his predecessors like menander comedies tended more about the fears and foibles the ordinary his personal family life and social mishaps rather than politics and public they were supremely civilized and sophisticated plays which were less farcical and satirical than the plays before this sophistication was what made him more successful than the other greek comedians who wrote the same the other two comedians are philemon and philemon was comedian whose comedies dwelt philosophical issues and diphilus was comedian whose comedies were noted for their broad comedy and farcical philemon comedies have come down fragments but comedies were translated and adapted examples these comedies are asinaria and rudens based the translation and adaptation diphilus one can conclude that was skilled the construction his substantial fragments new comedy have but complete the most substantially preserved text the dyskolos difficult grouch menander discovered and first published the

predecessors had prologues shape the understanding messengers speeches announce offstage descriptions sudden machina endings were all established techniques which playwrights exploited and evoked their the satirical and farcical element which featured strongly comedies increasingly diminished importance time went was eventually given more less completely and was not the emphasis the whether the form humour spectacle opened the way for increased representation daily life and the foibles recognisable character unlike their aristophanes some whose comedies departed from the athenian setting covered mythological themes and their plays were seldom placed setting other than their everyday world diphilus was notable gods and goddesses greek new comedy were personified abstractions who seldom appeared their there are generally miracles the greek playwrights from the genre greek new comedy not only developed literary style that differed from their predecessors multiple they also made considerable innovations examples their innovations were the development whole series distinct stereotype characters which were become the stock characters western comedy and the contributions they made the development the the cast plays included number minor characters drawn from limited number dimensional stock types such cooks parasites who introduced familiar jokes and recognisable patterns other stock characters plays were the senex iratus angry old the domineering parent who tries thwart his son daughter from achieving wedded and who often led into the same vices and follies for which has reproved his the bragging soldier who talked about the number enemies killed and how well treat their woman and the kind shrewd prostitute who hid her heart behind facade fierce menander gave stereotype characters sense that they were character his they were expected react the way they were supposed behave but some these stock characters appear rich unlayered humans new was this human dimension that was one the strengths used these stereotype characters comment human life and depict human folly and absurdity with wit and example such character cnemon from play was insufferably rude and objectionable character who showed how foolish and absurd humans could however rude and objectionable proved ultimately character who was not necessarily closed accepted that other views were proving willing compromise with life after was rescued from the fact that this character was not necessarily closed reason makes him character whom people can give compassion for the first love became
