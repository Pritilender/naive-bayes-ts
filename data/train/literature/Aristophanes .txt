clues about his personal beliefs his private was comic poet age when was conventional for poet assume the role didaskalos and though this specifically referred his training the chorus also covered his

sometimes boasts his originality dramatist yet his plays consistently espouse opposition radical new influences athenian caricatured leading figures the arts notably euripides whose influence his own work however once begrudgingly politics especially the populist cleon and religion where socrates was the most obvious such caricatures seem imply that aristophanes was fashioned yet that view him leads the writing plays was craft that could handed down from father and has been argued that aristophanes produced plays mainly entertain the audience and win prestigious the plays were written for production the great dramatic festivals the lenaia and city dionysia where they were judged and awarded places relative the works other comic elaborate series designed prevent prejudice and reduced the voting judges the city dionysia just five these judges probably reflected the mood the audiences yet there much uncertainty about the composition those the theatres were certainly with seating for least the theatre the program the city dionysia for example was with three tragedies and satyr play ahead the and possible that many the poorer citizens typically the main supporters demagogues like occupied the festival holiday with other the conservative views expressed the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes dominant group unrepresentative the production process might also have influenced the views expressed the throughout most career the chorus was essential success and was recruited and funded choregus wealthy citizen appointed the task one the archons choregus could regard his personal expenditure the chorus civic duty and public but aristophanes showed the knights that wealthy citizens could regard civic responsibilities punishment imposed them demagogues and populists like thus the political conservatism the plays might reflect the views the wealthiest section whose generosity comic dramatists depended for the success their when first play the banqueters was athens was imperial power and the peloponnesian war was only its fourth his plays often express pride the achievement the older generation the victors marathon yet they are not jingoistic and they are staunchly opposed the war with the plays are particularly scathing criticism war among whom populists such cleon figure the time his last play was produced around athens had been defeated its empire had been dismantled and had undergone transformation from the political the intellectual centre aristophanes was part this transformation and shared the intellectual fashions the the structure his plays evolves from old comedy his last surviving wealth more closely resembles new comedy however uncertain whether led merely responded changes audience aristophanes won second prize the city

between the polis and the real targets his acerbic aristophanes repeatedly savages cleon his later but these satirical diatribes appear have had effect political few weeks after the performance the knights play full cleon cleon was elected the prestigious board ten cleon also seems have had real power limit control the caricatures him continued and even beyond his the absence clear biographical facts about scholars make educated guesses based interpretation the language the inscriptions and summaries comments hellenistic and byzantine scholars can also provide useful know however from combination these and especially from comments the knights and the clouds that first three plays were not directed they were instead directed callistratus and arrangement that seemed suit aristophanes since appears have used these same directors many later plays well philoneides for example later directed the frogs and was also perhaps with directing the wasps aristophanes use directors complicates our reliance the plays sources biographical information since apparent references might have been made behalf his directors thus for example statement the chorus the acharnians seems indicate that the had personal association with the island aegina yet the terms poietes and didaskalos are often interchangeable since dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference the play could either aristophanes similarly the hero the acharnians complains about cleon dragging into over last but here again not clear this was said behalf aristophanes either whom might have been prosecuted comments made the chorus behalf aristophanes the clouds have been interpreted evidence that can have been hardly more than years old when his first play the banqueters was the second parabasis wasps appears indicate that reached some kind temporary accommodation with cleon following either the controversy over the babylonians subsequent controversy over the knights has been inferred from statements the clouds and peace that aristophanes was prematurely know that aristophanes was probably victorious least once the city dionysia with babylonians and least three times the with acharnians knights and frogs frogs fact won the unique distinction repeat performance subsequent know that son araros was also comic poet and could have been heavily involved the production his play wealth araros also thought have been responsible for the posthumous performances the now lost plays aeolosicon and cocalus and possible that the last these won the prize the city dionysia appears that second philippus was twice victorious the lenaia and could have directed some eubulus comedies third son was called either nicostratus and man the latter name appears the catalogue lenaia victors with two the first probably the late plato the symposium appears useful source biographical information about but its reliability open purports record conversations dinner party which both aristophanes and socrates are held some seven years after the performance the clouds the play which socrates was cruelly one the alcibiades even quotes from the play when teasing socrates over his appearance and yet there indication any feeling between socrates and plato aristophanes fact genial character and this has been interpreted evidence own friendship with him their friendship appears corroborated epitaph for reputedly written which the soul compared eternal shrine for the graces plato was only boy when the events the symposium are supposed have occurred and possible that his aristophanes fact based reading the for conversation among the guests turns the subject love and aristophanes explains his notion terms amusing device often uses his represented suffering attack hiccoughs and this might humorous reference the crude physical jokes his tells the other guests that quite happy thought amusing but wary appearing this fear being ridiculed consistent with his declaration the knights that embarked career comic playwright warily after witnessing the public contempt and ridicule that other dramatists had aristophanes survived the peloponnesian war two oligarchic revolutions and two democratic this has been interpreted evidence that was not actively involved politics despite his highly political was probably appointed the council five hundred for year the beginning the fourth century but such appointments were very common democratic athens socrates the trial leading his own put the issue personal conscience those troubled times quite aristophanes the poet the language plays and old comedy was valued ancient commentators model the attic dialect the orator quintilian believed that the charm and grandeur the attic dialect made old comedy example for orators study and and considered inferior these respects only the works revival interest the attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation plays during the and centuries resulting their survival plays the attic dialect couched verse and his plays can appreciated for their poetic for contemporaries the works homer and hesiod formed the cornerstone hellenes history and thus poetry had moral and social significance that made inevitable topic comic aristophanes was very conscious literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references other these include not only rival comic dramatists such eupolis and hermippus and predecessors such magnes crates and cratinus but also notably aeschylus sophocles and euripides all three whom are mentioned the frogs aristophanes was the equal these great tragedians his subtle use appears have modelled his approach language that euripides much that the comic dramatist cratinus labelled him addicted splitting full appreciation plays requires understanding the poetic forms employed with virtuoso and their different rhythms and there were three broad poetic iambic tetrameter verses and iambic dialogue aristophanes achieves effect resembling natural speech through the use the iambic trimeter corresponding the effects achieved english poets such shakespeare using iambic his realistic use the metre makes ideal for both dialogue and for instance the before the arrival the when the audience introduced the main issues the the acharnians opens with these three lines the dikaiopolis rendered here english iambic compound words tetrameter catalectic verses these are long lines anapests trochees iambs where each line ideally measured four dipodes pairs used various situations within each play such formal debates agons between characters typically anapestic excited dialogue heated argument typically trochaic the same early long speeches declaimed the chorus parabases either anapestic trochaic informal debates barely above the level ordinary dialogue typically limericks trechein the frogs orpheus musaeus hesiod the rhythm begins typical anapestic slows down consider the revered poets hesiod and then gallops off again its comic conclusion the expense the unfortunate such subtle variations rhythm are common the allowing for serious points made while still whetting the appetite for the next lyrics almost nothing known about the music that accompanied greek and the metre often varied and complex that difficult for modern readers audiences get feel for the intended yet aristophanes still impresses with the charm and simplicity his some the most memorable and haunting lyrics are dignified hymns set free the comic action the example taken from the wasps the lyric merely comic interlude and the rhythm steadily the syntax the original greek natural and unforced and was probably accompanied brisk and cheerful gliding concluding pun the expense who thought have lost his fortune thessaly penestes penniless pun pen the acharnians megarian embargo against megara can argued that the most important feature the language the plays particularly the use metaphors and pictorial the for the ears character with selective hearing are represented parasols that open and the frogs aeschylus said compose verses the manner horse rolling some plays feature revelations human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious such the marriage the hero pisthetairos zeus paramour the birds and the old crowned with the end the knights aristophanes and old comedy thalia muse sarcophagus the greek word for comedy derives from the words for and mos and and according aristotle comic drama actually developed from the first official comedy the city dionysia was not staged until which time tragedy had already been long established the first comedy the lenaia was staged later only about years before the performance there the acharnians the first surviving according comedy was slow gain official acceptance because nobody took yet only sixty years after comedy first appeared the city aristophanes observed that producing comedies was the most difficult work competition the dionysian festivals needed dramatic conventions for plays but also fuelled developments were quite rapid and aristotle could distinguish between and comedy the trend from old comedy new comedy saw move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock this was partly due the internationalization cultural perspectives during and after the peloponnesian for ancient commentators such new comedy was more sophisticated form drama than old however old comedy was fact complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches humour and early the genre appears have developed around complex set dramatic and these were only gradually simplified and the city dionysia and the lenaia were celebrated honour the god wine and euripides play the bacchae offers the best insight into century ideas about this old comedy can understood celebration the exuberant sense release inherent his worship was more interested finding targets for satire than any kind during the city statue the god was brought the theatre from temple outside the and remained the theatre throughout the overseeing the plays like privileged

rivals ages more than this scene opens the and reminder the audience that nobody above mockery old not even its patron god and its gods artists politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate comedy was kind licensed and there was legal redress for anyone who was slandered there were certain limits the scope the but they are not easily impiety could punished century but the absurdities implicit the traditional religion were open the polis was not allowed but stated the biography section this that could depend who was the audience and which festival was for old represented early analysed below terms three broad topicality festivity and dramatic structure contributes the complexity plays however associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance english translations and therefore treated separate topicality old emphasis real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult appreciate today without the aid scholarly see for example articles the knights the wasps and peace for lists topical the topicality the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production the plays ancient individual masks all actors classical athens wore but whereas tragedy and new comedy these identified stereotypical old comedy the masks were often caricatures real perhaps socrates attracted lot attention old comedy because his face lent itself easily caricature the knights are told that the mask makers were too afraid make caricature cleon there represented paphlagonian but are assured that the audience clever enough identify him the real scene action since old comedy makes numerous references people the the theatre itself was the real scene action and theatrical illusion was treated something the acharnians for the pnyx just few steps from the front and peace olympia separated from athens few supposed flight dung the audience sometimes drawn even dragged into the when the hero peace returns athens from his flight tells the audience that they looked like rascals when seen from the and seen close they look even the acharnians the hero confronts the archon basileus sitting the front and demands awarded first prize for drinking which none too subtle way for aristophanes request first prize for the drama self mocking theatre frequent parodying tragedy aspect old comedy that modern audiences find difficult but the lenaia and city dionysia included performances both comedies and and thus references tragedy were highly topical and immediately relevant the original the comic dramatist also poked fun comic poets and even ridiculed indicated that aristophanes mocked his own the clouds the chorus compares him young mother and the acharnians the chorus mockingly depicts him greatest weapon the war against political theatre the lenaia and city dionysus were religious and though the latter was the more prestigious the both were occasions for official pomp and the ceremonies for the lenaia were overseen the archon basileus and officials the eleusinian mysteries the city dionysia was overseen the archon eponymous and the priest opening ceremonies for the city dionysia addition the ceremonial arrival the parade full armour the sons warriors who died fighting for the polis until the end the peloponnesian presentation annual tribute from subject religious and political issues were topics that could hardly ignored such setting and the plays often treat them quite even jokes can serious when the topic especially the butts the most savage jokes are opportunists who prey the gullibility their fellow including the exponents new religious war profiteers and political the acharnians for lamachus represented crazed militarist whose preparations for war are hilariously compared the preparations for dinner cleon emerges from numerous similes and metaphors the knights protean form comic clinging political power every possible means for long yet the play also includes simple hymns invoking poseidon and and ends with visions miraculously transformed demos the morally reformed citizenry imaginative visions return peaceful activities resulting from peace with and plea for leniency for citizens suspected complicity oligarchic revolt are other examples serious purpose behind the teasing and taunting festival audience presented the comic dramatist with wide range not just political religious anyone known the audience could mocked for any such physical ugliness family bad perversions dishonesty cowardice and foreigners conspicuous presence imperial particularly the city often appear the plays comically mispronouncing attic these include spartans lysistrata scythians thesmophoriazusae persians boeotians and megarians the acharnians festivity the lenaia and city dionysia were religious but they resembled gala rather than church dirty jokes relaxation standards behaviour was permitted and the holiday spirit included bawdy irreverence towards both men and old comedy rich obscenities and the crude jokes are often very when the chorus the acharnians places curse choregus accused niggardly wishing upon him time mugging returns home from some drunken party and envisioning stoops down pick rock the accidentally picking fresh turd then envisioned hurling the turd his missing and accidentally hitting lyric poet not admired this was particularly funny because the curse was sung choreographed style chorus grown men who were otherwise known the audience respectable the musical extravaganza the chorus was vital the success play old comedy long after had lost its relevance for technically the competition the dramatic festivals was not between poets but between fact eight eleven surviving plays are named after the time the chorus tragedy was relatively small twelve and its role had been reduced that awkwardly placed but old comedy the chorus was large numbering was actively involved the its entry into the action was frequently its movements were practised with military precision and sometimes was involved choreographed skirmishes with the the expenditure training and maintenance chorus was and perhaps many people the original audience enjoyed comedy mainly for the spectacle and the chorus gradually lost its significance new comedy began obvious costumes consistent with the holiday much the humour old comedy slapstick buffoonery that require the careful often

obeyed crazy logic its own and yet always unfolded within dramatic structure that was repeated with minor variations from one play the structural elements are associated with different poetic meters and rhythms and these are generally lost english dramatic structure the structural elements typical aristophanic plot can summarized prologue introductory scene with dialogue soliloquy addressed the expressed iambic trimeter and explaining the situation that resolved the parodos the arrival the dancing and sometimes followed choreographed skirmish with one more often expressed long lines symmetrical scenes passages featuring songs and declaimed verses long lines arranged symmetrically two sections such that each half resembles the other meter and line the agon and parabasis can considered specific instances symmetrical parabasis verses through which the chorus addresses the audience firstly the middle the play and again near the end see the section below parabasis agon formal debate that decides the outcome the typically anapestic though iambs are sometimes used delineate inferior episodes sections dialogue iambic often succession scenes featuring minor characters towards the end songs often symmetrical pairs where each half has the same meter and number lines the used transitions between other structural between scenes while actors change and often commenting the exodus the departure the chorus and the song and dance celebrating the victory and sometimes celebrating symbolic the rules competition did not prevent playwright arranging and adjusting these elements suit his particular the acharnians and peace for there formal agon whereas the clouds there are two parabasis the parabasis address the audience the chorus the leader the chorus while the actors are leaving have left the the chorus this role speaks sometimes out the and sometimes but very often easy distinguish its two generally the parabasis occurs somewhere the middle play and often there second parabasis towards the the elements parabasis have been defined and named scholars but probable that own understanding was less the selection elements can vary from play play and varies considerably within plays between first and second the early plays the acharnians the birds are fairly uniform their approach however and the following elements parabasis can found within kommation this brief comprising short lines and often including valediction the departing such parabasis proper this usually defense the work and includes criticism the declaimed long lines anapestic aristophanes himself refers the parabasis proper only pnigos sometimes known comprises few short lines appended the parabasis proper kind rapid patter has been suggested that some the effects achieved pnigos can heard the lord nightmare act gilbert and iolanthe epirrhematic syzygies these are symmetrical scenes that mirror each other meter and number they form part the first parabasis and they often comprise the entire second they are characterized the following strophe ode these are lyrics variety sung the chorus the first parabasis invocation the gods and comic interlude the second epirrhema these are usually long lines trochaic broadly political their they were probably spoken the leader the chorus antistrophe antode these are songs that mirror the ode length and antepirrhema this another declaimed passage and mirrors the epirrhema length and the wasps thought offer the best example conventional approach and the elements parabasis can identified and located that play the wasps textual corruption probably the reason for the absence the antistrophe the second however there are several variations from the ideal even within the early for the parabasis proper the clouds lines composed eupolidean meter rather than anapests and the second parabasis includes kommation but lacks antistrophe and antepirrhema the clouds lines the second parabasis the acharnians lines can considered hybrid song the declaimed sections are merely continuations the strophe and and unlike the typical seems comment actions that occur stage during the understanding old comedy conventions such the parabasis necessary for proper understanding plays the other sensitive appreciation the plays necessary for proper understanding the influence and legacy old comedy menander new comedy the tragic sophocles and euripides died near the end the peloponnesian war and the art tragedy thereafter ceased yet comedy did continue evolve after the defeat athens and possible that did had master craftsman who lived long enough help usher into new indeed according one ancient source century one last aioliskon had neither parabasis nor any choral lyrics making type middle while kolakos
