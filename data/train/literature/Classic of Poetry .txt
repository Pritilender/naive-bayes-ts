rhymes between the penultimate words here shown each pair the second and third stanzas still rhyme standard with the rhyme words even having the same but the first stanza does not rhyme middle chinese any modern this was attributed lax rhyming practice until the ming dynasty scholar chen argued that the original rhymes had been obscured sound change since scholars have analyzed the rhyming patterns the poetry crucial evidence for the reconstruction old chinese phonology traditional scholarship the poetry identified three major literary devices employed the straightforward narrative explicit comparisons and implied comparisons the poems the classic poetry tend have certain typical patterns both rhyme and make much use often derived from authorship although the shijing does not specify the names authors association with the contained both traditional commentaries and modern scholarship have put forth hypotheses the classic history says that the poem owl chinese the odes was written the

this heavenly mandate would withdrawn upon the failure the ruling dynasty ensure the prosperity their the folksongs were deemed the best gauge their feelings and and thus indicative whether the nobility was ruling according the mandate heaven accordingly the songs were collected from the various converted from their diverse regional dialects into standard literary and presented accompanied with music the royal confucius the classic poetry historically has major place the canonical works associated with confucianism some qin dynasty such the analects and recently excavated manuscript from entitled discussion the odes mention involvement with the classic poetry however han dynasty historian sima qian records the grand historian was the first work directly attribute the poetry subsequent confucian tradition held that the shijing collection was edited confucius from larger piece collection its traditional piece this claim believed reflect early chinese tendency relate all the five classics confucius some way who the century had become the model sages and was believed have maintained cultural connection the early zhou however this view now generally the zuo zhuan records that the classic poetry already existed definitive form when confucius was just young the argument for canonicity jing included the traditional claim that confucius selected and edited the shijing poems from significantly larger body prexisting works attributed confucius comments upon the classic poetry such way indicate that holds great story the analects recounts that son kong told the the master once stood and hurried seek teaching from asked studied the not you study the odes then have nothing han dynasty according han the poetry and other classics were targets the burning books under qin shi huang and the songs had reconstructed largely from memory the subsequent han however the discovery qin copies showing the same variation han well evidence qin patronage the poetry have led modern scholars doubt this during the han period there were three different versions the poetry which each belonged different hermeneutic traditions the poetry the poetry and the han poetry were officially recognized with chairs the imperial academy during the reign emperor han until the later years the eastern han the dominant version the poetry was the poetry named after the state and founded shen student disciple the warring states period philosopher xunzi the mao tradition the poetry zhu attributed obscure scholar named who lived during the centuries was not officially recognized until the reign emperor ping however during the eastern han the mao poetry gradually became the primary proponents the mao poetry said that its text was descended from the first generation students and such should the authoritative shen influential dictionary shuowen jiezi written the century quotes almost exclusively from the mao poetry finally the renowned eastern han scholar zheng xuan used the mao poetry the basis for his annotated edition the poetry the the and han traditions had died leaving only the mao poetry which has become the received text use only isolated fragments the text among the remains the xiping stone classics zheng edition the mao text became the imperially authorized text and commentary the poetry legacy confucian allegory classic poetry the book odes has been revered confucian classic since the han and has been studied and memorized centuries scholars the individual songs the odes though frequently rustic have traditionally been saddled with elaborate allegorical meanings that assigned moral political meaning the smallest details each the popular songs were seen good keys understanding the troubles the common and were often read complaints against lovers were seen complaints against faithless maiden warns her lover not too commentators promptly discover that the piece refers feudal noble whose brother had been plotting against the extensive allegorical traditions associated with the odes were theorized herbert giles have begun the warring states period justification for confucius focus upon such seemingly simple and ordinary collection these far fetched interpretations seem have gone completely unquestioned until the when scholar zheng qiao first wrote his skepticism european sinologists like giles and marcel granet ignored these traditional interpretations their analysis the original meanings the odes granet his list rules for properly reading the odes wrote that readers should take account the standard reject uncertain terms the distinction drawn between songs evicting good state morals and songs attesting perverted and all symbolic and likewise any interpretation that supposes refined technique the part the these traditional allegories politics and morality are longer seriously followed any modern readers china political influence the odes became important and controversial influencing social and educational
