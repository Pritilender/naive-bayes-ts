margins religious works most them preserved monasteries germany france and having been taken there early irish and not being they were rarely consulted and did not wear unlike their counterparts the oldest manuscript with significant irish language content preserved ireland the book armagh these early though little interest outside philology show the wide learning the commentators and the extraordinary even that early the language which they their language and says kuno meyer stand high level comparison with those the old high german glosses find formed learned prose style which allows even the finest shades thought easily and perfectly from which must conclude that there must have been long previous culture the going back the very least the beginning the sixth these glosses are found rzburg gallen karlsruhe milan turin sankt paul lavanttal and the liber hymnorum and the stowe missal are after the glosses and the book armagh perhaps the most ancient manuscripts which irish they date from about existing manuscript literature the oldest books miscellaneous literature are the lebor huidre book the dun transcribed about and the book leinster which dates from about fifty years these books are great miscellaneous literary after them come many valuable vellums the date which these manuscripts were penned criterion the date which their contents were first for many them contain literature from the ancient forms words and other must have been committed writing least early the cannot carry these pieces further back with firm certainty using linguistic but evident from their contents that many them must have been orally transmitted for centuries before they were committed must also noted that century manuscript may sometimes give more correct version century piece than vellum many centuries the exact number irish manuscripts still existing has never been accurately the number the royal irish academy dublin alone probably amounting some fifteen and beirne catalogued little more than half the manuscripts the and the catalogue filled thirteen volumes containing pages these alphabetic index the pieces contained was made three and index the principal addition some other material thirteen volumes from examination these books one may roughly calculate that the pieces catalogued would number about eight ten varying from long epic sagas single quatrains and yet there remains great deal more work which after delay very many years happily now last process the library trinity dublin also contains great number valuable manuscripts all many them probably about the british museum the bodleian library oxford university the advocates library and the biblioth que royale brussels are all repositories large number valuable from what know the contents the existing manuscripts may set down follows rough classification the literature contained may well begin with the ancient epics dating substantially from pagan probably first written down the seventh century even these epics generally contain verses poetry and often whole just the case the french chantefable aucassin nicollet after the substantially pagan efforts may come the early christian especially the lives the which are both numerous and visions homilies commentaries the monastic prayers hymns and all possible kinds religious and didactic after these may place the many ancient and there exists besides great mass genealogical tribal and historical after this may come the bardic poetry the poetry the hereditary poets attached the great gaelic families and the provincial from the century down the then follow the brehon laws and other legal and enormous quantity writings irish and latin glossaries metrical astronomical geographical and medical nor there any lack free translations from classical and medieval such lucan bellum civile bede historica ecclesiastica mandeville travels arthurian romances and the this catalogue may perhaps added the unwritten lore the island both prose and verse which has only lately begun but which considerable collections have already been such then brief and bald what the student will find before him the irish there may observed this list two remarkable there epic handed down entirely and there dramatic the irish epic though generally interwoven with numerous for though epic poems exist such some the ossianic poems they are modern and none the great and ancient epics are constructed this the absence the however more curious highly cultivated irish literature undoubtedly and excellent scholars both greek and latin the early irish nevertheless they not seem have produced even miracle has been alleged that some the ossianic especially those containing semi serious dialogue between the last the great the poet ois ossian called and the first the great christian patrick were originally intended least different this really then the irish had least the rudiments but they never appear have carried beyond these and the absence all real dramatic however may accounted one the first things that likely strike with astonishment the student comparative early irish epic saga the prose epic saga and kept for well over thousand the book leinster manuscript the middle find list the names epic the ollam who was the highest dignitary among the and whose training lasted for some twelve was obliged learn two hundred and fifty these prime sagas and one hundred secondary the manuscripts themselves divide these prime sagas into the following from the very names which may get glance the genius the early and form some conception the tragic nature his destruction fortified cow spoils cattle raids courtships battles stories navigations tragical feasts sieges adventures elopements slaughters water expeditions progresses and says the book leinster who does not synchronize and harmonize all these addition the names sagas that more names occur the century tale all the known except for one added and another with transcription refer events prior apparently the list was drawn the trace author identity author may not even the right word for stories that likely grew woven around tribal even family and some cases around incidents early celtic mythology this process formed stories that were told and burnished and added professional poets and some them were handed down for generations before ever put even before scholars made lists just their names and those that recount ancient tribal events dynastic wars were probably much magnified and undoubtedly distorted over more recent tales may provide fairly accurate accounts real seems certain soon christianity pervaded the island and bardic schools and colleges formed alongside the class learning more popular than studying the great traditional exploits and tragedies the various irish families and the peregrinations the bards and communication among their colleges must have propagated throughout ireland any local traditions worthy these stories embodied the essence the national but only few their enormous number and most these are preserved mere some however survive nearly full these ancient however probably tell the same exact tales did the professional for the poets write generally early christian monks recorded the they took interest and pride preserving early memorials their they cultivated the native language such degree that early period was used alongside and soon almost displaced even the church this patriotism the irish monks and early cultivation the vernacular are since was the reverse what took place the rest elsewhere the church used latin principal means destroying native and pagan the northmen inflicted irrevocable losses the irish from the end the the middle the followed the ravages the norman invasion ireland and the later and more ruthless destructions the elizabethan and cromwellian english despite those tragic and violent cultural curry could assert that knew large quarto pages strictly historical computes that tales the ossianic and fenian cycles would fill more and addition miscellaneous and imaginative cycles that are neither historical nor would fill pagan literature and christian sentiment the bulk the ancient stories and some the ancient poems were probably committed writing monks the but are substantially pagan conception and yet there scarcely one them which some christian allusion the some biblical does not this likely when christianity displaced tacit sympathetic clerics let the bard fili and the representative the old pagan learning propagate their tales poems and the price little christian respectful the dovetailing the christian into the pagan most the oldest that even casual analysis easily separates the the pagan substratum stands forth entirely distinct from the christian for the evidently pagan saga called the wooing find the description the pagan paradise given its literary passport cunningly interwoven allusion was the wife one the tuatha danann who were she reborn the pagan irish seem have believed metempsychosis and weds the king her former husband the tuatha danann still loves follows her into life and tries win her back singing captivating description the glowing unseen land which would lure lady wouldst thou come with cries the wondrous land that describes the crimson the foxglove every beauty land the land speak youth never grows into old age warm sweet streams traverse the etc then the evidently pagan description this land the gods made passable added verse that adroitly tells though the inhabitants this glorious country saw nobody saw because the cloud wrongdoing has concealed this easy analysis the early irish literature into its christian and christian elements lends absorbing interest and great value the history european for when all christian additions are find picture pagan life europe that find the church adopted towards pagan sagas the same position that adopted toward pagan law see reasons for doubting that really genuine pictures christian culture are preserved the individual the saga originated pagan and was propagated christian and that too without its seeking fresh from christian but must ascribe the influence christianity that what specifically pagan irish saga shifted into the and yet there exist many whose contents are plainly the christian monks were certainly not the first who reduced the ancient sagas fixed but later they copied them faithfully and promulgated them after ireland had been converted irish literature and early europe when understood that the ancient irish sagas even though more less distorted some cases reminiscences past and others real historical dating from the pagan then needs only reflection realize their zimmer writes that nothing except spurious criticism that takes for original and primitive the most palpable nonsense which irish writers from the twelfth the sixteenth century are guilty with regard their own which many respects strange and foreign nothing but such criticism can the other hand make the attempt doubt the historical character the chief persons the saga for believe that conor macnessa cuchulainn and fionn mac cumhaill are just much historical personalities arminius dietrich berne etzel and their date just well kelt studien fasc the first three these lived the century and finn the arbois jubainville expresses himself the same have doubt the reality the principal this cycle introduction tude rature celtique and the story the boru tribute imposed leinster the century the story has real facts for basis though certain details may have been created the and irish epic barbarous though like irish monument civilization far superior that the most ancient germans celtique irlande preface xli ireland writes darmesteter his english studies which summarize conclusions derives from the works the great celtic has the peculiar privilege history continuous from the earliest centuries our era the present she has preserved the infinite wealth her literature complete and faithful picture the ancient civilization the irish literature therefore the key which opens the celtic world but the celtic world means large portion europe and the key its past history can found present nowhere else than the irish without them would have view the past history great part europe through that distorting the coloured glasses the greeks and whom all outer nations were into whose social life they had motive for apart from irish literature would have means estimating what were the modes manners and habits those great celtic races who once possessed large part the ancient gaul belgium north parts spain switzerland and the british who burnt plundered and colonized asia minor but the ancient epics ireland find another standard which and through this early irish medium get clear view the life and manners the race one its and find many characteristic customs the continental which are just barely mentioned alluded greek and roman reappearing all the circumstance and expansion such the custom the posidonius mentions which provides the foundation for one the most famous irish bricriu feast the irish sagas repeatedly refer the chariot which became obsolete gaul couple hundred years before the greatest the epic the warriors always fight from diodorus siculus mentions that the bards had power make battles cease interposing with song between the caesar says gallic war the gaulish druids spent twenty years studying and learned great number but irish literature tells what the probably the counterpart the gaulish actually did the manners and customs which the men the time lived and moved are writes with naive realism which leaves room for doubt the former actuality the scenes matter costume and eating and building and arrangement the banqueting manners observed the feasts and much find here the most valuable texte says that irish saga the only flowing source unbroken the ancient irish says arbois that forms the connecting point between the celtic languages and the gaulish the inscribed coins and proper names preserved greek and roman evident that those the great continental nations whose ancestors were mostly but whose literature and traditions have completely study their own turn the principal saga cycles irish mythology there are four great cycles irish not all which fully mythological cycle mythological cycle the mythological cycle dealt with the tuatha danann the gods and the fomorians gods darkness and and giving under the apparently early history the various races that colonised really distorted early celtic according these the nemedians first seized upon the islands and were oppressed the who are described african these races nearly exterminated each other the fight round conand tower tory island some the nemedians escaped greece and came back couple hundred years later calling themselves fir bolg others the nemedians who escaped came back calling themselves the tuatha danann these last fought the battle north moytura and beat the fir they fought the battle south moytura later and beat the they held the island until the also called milesians scoti came and vanquished good sagas about both these battles are each existing only single nearly all the rest this most interesting cycle has been lost found merely condensed these mythological pieces dealt with dynasties and probably the struggle between good and evil there over all sense vagueness and ulster cycle ulster cycle the ulster cycle irish ocht formerly known the red branch one

around the hill allen this whole body romance later growth rather expresses much later state civilization than the chulainn there mention fighting the many other characteristics that mark the

between the years and this time was the product vassal propagated only various parts the fionn saga seem have developed different quarters the that about diarmuid duibhne south and that about goll mac morna certain that this cycle was far the most popular and widely spread the being familiarly known every part ireland and speaking scotland even the present developed also direction its for though none the heroic tales are wholly yet the number ossianic ballads and poems amounting probably some lines mostly the more modern historical cycle cycles the kings was part the duty the medieval irish court poets record the history the family and the genealogy the king they this they did poems that blended the mythological and the historical greater lesser the resulting stories form what has come known the historical cycle more correctly there are number independent the kings that are included range from the almost entirely mythological labraid loingsech who allegedly became high king ireland around the entirely historical brian boru however the greatest glory the historical cycle the buile shuibhne the frenzy sweeney century tale told verse and suibhne king naraidi was cursed ronan and

early christian literature perhaps country that ever adopted christianity was thoroughly and rapidly permeated and perhaps saturated with its language and concepts was adopted and made its own secular

the crown the the baptized common word for laich now laoch simply from laicus the latin language the one used for religious both prose and for some time after the introduction were written the earliest saint patrick used his confession did adaman his life columcille but already the middle the century the native language had largely displaced all over ireland medium for religious for for books and the lives find the irish language used large religious much which some which represents lost latin originals now known only irish one interesting development this class literature the

the milesian furs these visions were very popular and numerous they gave rise the the century aislinge meic con glinne more important than however are the lives the because many dating back very remote throw great deal light the manners the early the first half the century brother michael travelled round ireland and made copies between thirty and forty lives irish which are still preserved the burgundian library nine exist elsewhere ancient part one the voyage brendan spread all through but the latin version much more complete than any existing irish the original having probably been irish historical literature owing the nature the and considering the isolation extremely rather procure independent foreign the truth irish but although such testimony denied yet there happily exists another kind evidence which may appeal with comparative this nothing less than the records natural phenomena reported the for can shown calculating modern science has enabled that such natural phenomena the appearance comets the occurrence eclipses are recorded the day and hour the then can also say with something like certainty that these phenomena were recorded their appearance writers who personally observed and whose writings must have been actually consulted and seen these later annalists whose books now let the annals ulster which treat ireland and irish history from about the year but which the written copy dates only from the see from the years many eighteen records eclipses and comets and all these agree exactly with modern how impossible keep such records unless written memoranda are made the time eyewitnesses shown the fact that born recording the great solar eclipse that took place only eleven years before his own yet two days astray his while the other hand the
