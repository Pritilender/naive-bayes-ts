being just one example such cross cultural transmission two theories origins have attempted explain the common elements fairy tales found spread over one that single point origin generated any given which then spread over the the other that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately many different fairy tales with very similar characters and motifs are found spread across many different many researchers hold this caused the spread such people repeat tales they have heard foreign although the oral nature makes impossible trace the route except folklorists have attempted determine the origin internal which can not always joseph jacobs comparing the scottish tale the ridere riddles with the version collected the brothers the riddle noted that

thompson classification system and vladimir propp morphology the folk tale aarne thompson this system groups fairy and folk tales according their overall common identifying features are picked out decide which tales are grouped much therefore depends what features are regarded for tales like cinderella which persecuted with the help the fairy godmother similar magical helper attends event which she wins the love prince and identified his true are classified type the persecuted some such tales are the wonderful birch aschenputtel katie woodencloak the story tam and cam xian cap rushes catskin fair brown and trembling finette cendron allerleirauh further analysis the tales shows that cinderella the wonderful birch the story tam and cam xian and aschenputtel the heroine persecuted her stepmother and refused permission the ball other and fair brown and trembling and finette cendron her sisters and other female and these are grouped while cap rushes catskin and allerleirauh the heroine driven from home her and must take work kitchen and these are grouped but katie woodencloak she driven from home her persecutions and must take service kitchen and tattercoats she refused
