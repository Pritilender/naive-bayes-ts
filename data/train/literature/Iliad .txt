character the intellectual interest era such thucydides and plato was limited their utility way talking about human life rather than description because the gods remain religious rather than human their existence without the foundation either dogma bible then allowed greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom conjure gods fitting any religious function they required the origin consciousness the breakdown the bicameral mind psychologist julian jaynes uses the iliad major supporting evidence for his theory bicameralism which posits that until about the time described the iliad humans had much different mentality than present day essentially lacking what call suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified until the change human mentality that incorporated the motivating force into the conscious points out that almost every action the iliad caused influenced and that earlier translations show astonishing lack words suggesting planning those

antiquity scholarly consensus mostly places the century although some favour century herodotus placed homer approximately years before his own which would place homer circa the historical backdrop the poem the time the bronze age collapse the early century homer thus separated from his subject matter about years the period known the greek dark ages intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question which portions the poem preserve genuine traditions from the mycenaean period the catalogue ships particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray greece the iron age the time but was before the dorian invasion the title ilias genitive iliados elliptic for poiesis meaning the trojan the specifically feminine adjective form from troy the masculine adjective form would used herodotus venetus copied the century the oldest fully extant manuscript the iliad the editio princeps dates printed demetrius chalcondyles florence the iliad oral tradition the greeks applied the iliad and the odyssey the bases pedagogy literature was central the cultural function the itinerant rhapsode who composed consistent epic poems from memory and and disseminated via song and his travels and the panathenaic festival music poetics and celebrating originally classical scholars treated the iliad and the odyssey written and homer yet the milman parry had launched movement claiming his investigation the oral homeric stock and reiteration phrases stanzas established that these formulae were artifacts oral tradition easily applied hexametric line word stock epithet resourceful reiteration may complement character name filling thus freeing the poet compose line original formulaic text complete his parry and his albert lord studied the formulaic composition serbian oral yielding the parry lord thesis that established oral tradition studies later developed eric havelock marshall mcluhan walter ong the singer tales lord presents likenesses between the tragedies the greek the iliad and the sumerian enkidu the epic gilgamesh and claims with careful analysis the repetition thematic that the patroclus storyline upsets established compositional formulae bride and thus stock phrase reiteration does not restrict his originality fitting story likewise the arming motif prof james armstrong reports that the formulae yield richer meaning because the arming diction describing agamemnon paris and serves heighten the importance impressive thus creates atmosphere wherein homer distinguishes patroclus from and foreshadows the death with positive and negative turns the iliad occasional syntactic inconsistency may oral tradition for aphrodite despite being painfully wounded diomedes book and the divine representations may mix mycenaean and greek dark age mythologies parallelling the hereditary basileis nobles lower social rank with minor such scamander warfare the iliad depiction infantry combat despite mycenae and troy being maritime the iliad

shield more suitable for defence than for while his achilles sports rounded octagonal shield that successfully deploys along with his spear against the iliad describing infantry homer names the phalanx formation but most scholars not believe the historical trojan war was the bronze age the chariot was the main battle weapon the battle kadesh the available from the dendra armour and the pylos palace indicate the mycenaeans used man with armed principal unlike the man hittite chariots with armed and unlike the armed egyptian and assyrian man nestor spearheads his troops with advises iliad although depictions are can seen the very end that victory war far more somber where all that lost becomes the other the funeral games are for the dead life this overall depiction war runs contrary many other citation needed ancient greek where war aspiration for greater influence classical greek warfare while the homeric poems the iliad were not necessarily revered scripture the ancient they were most certainly seen guides that were important the intellectual understanding any educated greek this evidenced the fact that the late fifth century was the sign man standing able recite the iliad and odyssey moreover can argued that the warfare shown the iliad and the way which was had profound and very traceable effect greek warfare the effect epic literature can broken down into three tactics ideology and the mindset order discern these necessary take look few examples from each these much the detailed fighting the iliad done the heroes one one much like the odyssey there even set ritual which must observed each these for major hero may encounter lesser hero from the opposing which case the minor hero threats may and then the minor hero the victor often strips the body its armor and military here example this ritual and this type one combat the iliad there telamonian ajax struck down the son simoeisios his whom once his mother descending from ida bore beside the banks simoeis when she had followed her father and mother tend the therefore they called him but could not render again the care his dear was beaten down beneath the spear hearted who struck him first came forward beside the nipple the right and the bronze spearhead drove clean through the the biggest issue reconciling the connection between the epic fighting the iliad and later greek warfare the warfare seen greek history well after iliad while there are discussions soldiers arrayed semblances the phalanx throughout the iliad the focus the poem the heroic mentioned would seem contradict the tactics the however the phalanx did have its heroic the masculine one fighting epic manifested phalanx fighting the emphasis holding position this replaces the singular heroic competition found the iliad one example this the spartan tale picked men fighting against picked this battle only two men are left standing for the argives and one for the othryades the remaining goes back stand his formation with mortal wounds while the remaining two argives back argos report their thus the spartans claimed this their last man displayed the ultimate feat bravery maintaining his position the terms the ideology commanders later greek the iliad has interesting the iliad expresses definite disdain for tactical when hector before challenges the great know how storm way into the struggle flying know how tread the measures the grim floor the war yet great you are would not strike you watching however despite examples disdain for this tactical there reason believe that the iliad well later greek endorsed tactical genius the part their for there are multiple passages the iliad with commanders such agamemnon nestor discussing the arraying troops gain indeed the trojan war won notorious example greek guile the trojan horse this even later referred homer the odyssey the this between guileful tactics the greeks the iliad and those the later greeks not difficult one spartan often seen the pinnacle greek military were known for their tactical and for this was feat desired indeed this type leadership was the standard advice greek tactical ultimately while homeric fighting
