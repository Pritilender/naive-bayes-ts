and dating layers within the some elements the present mahabharata can traced back vedic the background the mahabharata suggests the origin the epic occurs after the very early vedic period and before the first indian was rise the third century that this date not too far removed from the century generally agreed that unlike the which have preserved the epic was popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform changes language and the earliest components this dynamic text are believed older than the earliest references have the which may include allusion panini century bce grammar asht estimated that the sanskrit text probably reached something final the early gupta period about the century vishnu editor the first great critical edition the mahabharata commented useless think reconstructing fluid text literally original the basis archetype and stemma codicum what then our objective can only reconstruct the oldest form the text which possible reach the basis the manuscript material that manuscript evidence somewhat given its material composition and the climate but very the mahabharata itself distinguishes core portion verses the bharata proper opposed additional secondary while the ashvalayana grhyasutra makes similar least three redactions the text are commonly jaya with verses attributed vyasa bharata with verses recited vaisampayana and finally the mahabharata recited ugrasrava sauti with over verses however some scholars such john argue that jaya and bharata refer the same and ascribe the theory jaya with verses misreading verse adiparvan the redaction this large body text was carried out after formal emphasizing the numbers and the addition the latest parts may dated the absence the anushasana parva and the virata parva from the spitzer the oldest surviving sanskrit text dates the kushan period according what one character says there were three versions the beginning with manu astika sub parva vasu respectively these versions would correspond the addition one and then another settings the vasu version would omit the frame settings and begin with the account the birth the astika version would add the sarpasattra and ashvamedha material from brahmanical introduce the name mahabharata and identify vyasa the the redactors these additions were probably pancharatrin scholars who according oberlies likely retained control over the text until its final mention the huna the bhishma parva however appears imply that this parva may have been edited around the century citation needed the parva includes the snake sacrifice sarpasattra janamejaya explaining its detailing why all snakes existence were intended and why spite there are still snakes this sarpasattra material was often considered independent tale added

setting the epic has historical precedent iron age vedic india where the kuru kingdom was the center political power during roughly bce dynastic conflict the period could have been the inspiration for the jaya the foundation which the mahabharata corpus was with climactic battle eventually coming viewed epochal puranic literature presents genealogical lists associated with the mahabharata the evidence the puranas two the first there the direct statement that there were years between the birth parikshit and the accession mahapadma commonly dated bce which would yield estimate about bce for the bharata however this would imply improbably long reigns average for the kings listed the the second kind are analyses parallel genealogies the puranas between the times adhisimakrishna and mahapadma pargiter accordingly estimated generations averaging different dynastic lists assuming years for the average duration arrived estimate bce for and thus approximately bce for the bharata lal

two collateral branches the family that participate the struggle are the kaurava and the pandava although the kaurava the senior branch the duryodhana the eldest younger than yudhisthira the eldest both duryodhana and yudhisthira claim first line inherit the the struggle culminates the great battle kurukshetra which the pandavas are ultimately the battle produces complex conflicts kinship and instances family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what well the the mahabharata itself ends with the death krishna and the subsequent end his dynasty and ascent the pandava brothers also marks the beginning the hindu age kali yuga the fourth and final age which great values and noble ideas have and man heading towards the complete dissolution right morality and the older generations raja ravi varma king ancestor shantanu the king hastinapura has lived marriage with the goddess ganga and has devavrata later called bhishma great who becomes the heir many years when king shantanu goes

princes draupadi pandavas yudhishthira bhima arjuna nakula sahadeva raja ravi varma when vichitravirya dies young without any satyavati asks her first son vyasa father children with the the ambika shuts her eyes when she sees and her son dhritarashtra born ambalika turns pale and bloodless upon seeing and thus her son pandu born pale and unhealthy the term pandu may also mean due the physical challenges the first two satyavati asks vyasa try once however ambika and ambalika send their maid vyasa fathers third vidura the born healthy and grows one the wisest characters the mahabharata serves prime minister mahamantri king pandu and king when the princes grow dhritarashtra about crowned king bhishma when vidura intervenes and uses his knowledge politics assert that blind person

notions both sides soon adopt dishonourable the end the day only the satyaki kripa ashwatthama kritavarma yuyutsu and krishna the end the pandavas persian after seeing the gandhari who had lost all her curses krishna witness similar annihilation his for though divine and capable stopping the had not done krishna accepts the which bears fruit years the pandavas who had ruled their kingdom decide renounce clad skins and rags they retire the himalaya and climb towards heaven their bodily stray dog travels with one one the brothers and draupadi fall their each one yudhisthira gives the rest the reason for their fall draupadi was partial nakula and sahadeva were vain and proud their bhima and arjuna were proud their strength and archery respectively only the virtuous who had tried everything
