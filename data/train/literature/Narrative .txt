interpretive knowledge are the essential while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics the according types narrators and their narrative modes choice the narrator crucial for the way work fiction perceived the there distinction between first person and third person narrative which rard genette refers homodiegetic and heterodiegetic respectively homodiegetic narrator describes own personal experiences character the such narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions heterodiegetic describes the experiences the characters that appear the narrative wherein events are seen through the eyes person internal focaliser said some the author may omniscient and employ multiple points view well and comment events they most narrators present their story

conceptual metaphors defined linguist george lakoff approach called narrative inquiry was resting the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense random complex multicausal experience the imposition story human propensity simplify data through predilection for narratives over complex data sets typically leads narrative fallacy easier for the human mind remember and make decisions the basis stories with than remember strings this one reason why narratives are powerful and why many the classics the humanities and social sciences are written the narrative but humans read meaning into data and compose even where this narrative the way avoid the narrative fallacy different from the way avoid other error scholarly applying the usual methodical checks for validity and reliability how data are analyzed and citation needed several criteria for assessing the validity narrative research was including the objective the emotional the moral and the clarity the mathematical sociology approach mathematical the theory comparative narratives was devised order describe and compare the structures expressed and directed graph where multiple causal links incident into node are driven sequential narratives conceived comprise the following finite set state descriptions the world the components which are weakly ordered finite set agents individual finite set actions mapping onto the structure directed graph generated letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed specified the action skeleton can then comprising further digraph where the actions are depicted nodes and edges take the form action determined context other action narratives can both abstracted and generalised imposing algebra upon their structures and thence defining homomorphism between the the insertion driven causal links narrative can achieved using the method bayesian developed peter abell the theory comparative narratives conceives narrative directed graph comprising multiple causal links social the general action causes action specified the absence sufficient comparative cases enable statistical treatment the causal items evidence support and against particular causal link are assembled and used compute the bayesian likelihood ratio the subjective causal statements the form she did because and subjective counterfactuals had not
