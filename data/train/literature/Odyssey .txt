the and reunited with his faithful penelope all ancient and nearly all modern editions and translations the odyssey are divided into books this division convenient but may not many scholars believe was developed alexandrian editors the century the classical period moreover several the books individually and were given their own the first four focusing are commonly known the telemachy odysseus narrative book featuring his encounter with the cyclops traditionally called the cyclopeia book the section describing his meeting with the spirits the dead known the nekuia books through wherein odysseus recalls his adventures for his phaeacian are collectively referred the apologoi odysseus stories book wherein odysseus kills all the has been given the title mnesterophonia slaughter the this concludes the greek epic cycle though fragments remain the alternative sorts known the telegony this telegony aside the last lines the odyssey corresponding book are believed many scholars have been added slightly later several passages earlier books seem setting the events book were indeed later the offending editor would seem have changed earlier text for more about varying views the authorship and unity the poem see homeric scholarship geography the odyssey homer ithaca geography the odyssey the events the main sequence the odyssey excluding embedded narrative his take place the peloponnese and what are now called the ionian islands there are difficulties the apparently simple identification ithaca the homeland which may may not the same island that now called the wanderings odysseus told the and the location the own island scheria pose more fundamental geography scholars both ancient and are divided whether not any the places visited odysseus after ismaros and before his return ithaca are dating the odyssey scientists marcelo magnasco and constantino baikouzis rockefeller university used clues the text and astronomical data attempt pinpoint the time return from his journey after the trojan the first clue sighting venus just before dawn arrives the second new moon the night before the massacre the the final clue total eclipse falling over ithaca around when suitors sit down for their noon the seer theoclymenus approaches the suitors and foretells their saying the sun has been obliterated from the and unlucky darkness invades the the problem with this that the only seen and the suitors toss him calling him one else sees the sky and therefore not actually described eclipse within the merely vision doctors baikouzis and magnasco state that odds that purely fictional references these phenomena hard satisfy would coincide accident with the only eclipse the century are they conclude that these three astronomical references the sense that the astronomical phenomena pinpoint the date april bce the most likely date return this dating places the destruction ten years which close the archaeologically dated destruction troy viia circa influences the odyssey scholars have seen strong influences from near eastern mythology and literature the odyssey martin west has noted substantial parallels between the epic gilgamesh and the odyssey both odysseus and gilgamesh are known for traveling the ends the and their journeys the land the his voyage the odysseus follows instructions given him circe goddess who the daughter the god helios her aeaea located the edges the and seems have close associations with the like gilgamesh gets directions how reach the land the dead from divine this the goddess siduri who like dwells the sea the ends the her home
