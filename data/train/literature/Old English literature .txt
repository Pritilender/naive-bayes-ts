epic poetry may bear some resemblance ancient greek epics such the iliad and odyssey the question and how saxon poetry was passed down through oral tradition remains subject and the question for any particular poem unlikely answered with perfect parry and lord had already demonstrated the density metrical formulas ancient greek and observed that the same phenomenon was apparent the old english alliterative hrothgar mathelode helm scildinga beowulf mathelode bearn ecgtheowes addition verbal many themes have been shown appear among the various works saxon the theory proposes explain this fact suggesting that the poetry was composed formulae and themes from stock common the poetic well literary passages composed individual artists more modern larry benson introduced the concept describe the
