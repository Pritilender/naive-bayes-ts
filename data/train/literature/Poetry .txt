dramatic aristotle work was influential throughout the middle east during the islamic golden age well europe during the renaissance later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry and defined opposition prose which was generally understood writing with proclivity logical explication and linear narrative this does not imply that poetry illogical lacks but rather that poetry attempt render the beautiful sublime without the burden engaging the logical narrative thought english romantic poet john keats termed this escape from logic negative capability this romantic approach views form key element successful poetry because form abstract and distinct from the underlying notional this approach remained influential into the during this there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic part due the spread european colonialism and the attendant rise global addition boom translation during the romantic period numerous ancient works were century disputes archibald macleish some century literary theorists relying less the opposition prose and focused the poet simply one who creates using and poetry what the poet the underlying concept the poet creator not and some modernist poets essentially not distinguish between the creation poem with and creative acts other yet other modernists challenge the very attempt define poetry the rejection traditional forms and structures for poetry that began the first half the century coincided with questioning the purpose and meaning traditional definitions poetry and distinctions between poetry and particularly given examples poetic prose and prosaic numerous modernist poets have written traditional forms what traditionally would have been considered although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established metrical means while there was substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools the breakdown this reaction focused much the development new formal structures and syntheses the revival older forms and recently postmodernism has come convey more completely prose and poetry distinct and also among genres having meaning only cultural postmodernism goes beyond emphasis the creative role the emphasize the role the reader text hermeneutics and highlight the complex cultural web within which poem today throughout the poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the further confounding attempts definition and classification that were once sensible within tradition such the western canon elements prosody meter prosody the study the rhythm and intonation rhythm and meter are although closely meter the definitive pattern established for verse such iambic pentameter while rhythm the actual sound that results from line prosody also may used more specifically refer the scanning poetic lines show rhythm timing tone pitch accent robinson jeffers the methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic languages are often described having timing set primarily accents syllables moras depending how rhythm though language can influenced multiple japanese mora timed syllable timed languages include latin catalan french leonese galician and spanish english russian and generally german are timed varying intonation also affects how rhythm languages can rely either such vedic sanskrit ancient tonal languages include vietnamese lithuanian and most subsaharan languages metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements stresses syllables into repeated patterns called feet within modern english verse the pattern stresses primarily differentiate rhythm based meter modern english most often founded the pattern stressed and unstressed syllables alone elided the classical languages the other while the metrical units are vowel length rather than stresses define the old english poetry used metrical pattern involving varied numbers syllables but fixed number strong stresses each the chief device ancient hebrew biblical poetry including many the psalms was parallelism rhetorical structure which successive lines reflected each other grammatical sound notional all parallelism lent itself antiphonal call response performance which could also reinforced intonation thus biblical poetry relies much less metrical feet create but instead creates rhythm based much larger sound units phrases and some classical poetry such venpa the tamil language had rigid grammars the point that they could expressed context free grammar which ensured chinese poetry tones well stresses create classical chinese poetics identifies four tones the level rising departing and entering tone the formal patterns meter used modern english verse create rhythm longer dominate contemporary english the case free verse rhythm often organized based looser units cadence rather than regular robinson jeffers marianne moore and william carlos williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter critical english jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm alternative accentual meter systems scansion the western poetic meters are customarily grouped according characteristic metrical foot and the number feet per the number metrical feet line are described using greek tetrameter for four feet and hexameter for six for thus iambic pentameter meter comprising five feet per which the predominant kind foot the iamb this metric system originated ancient greek poetry and was used poets such pindar and sappho and the great tragedians athens similarly dactylic hexameter comprises six feet per which the dominant kind foot the dactyl dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter greek epic poetry the earliest extant examples which are the works homer and hesiod iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used number including william shakespeare and henry wadsworth longfellow respectively the most common metrical feet english

concepts similar the iamb and dactyl describe common combinations long and short each these types feet has certain whether alone combination with other the for the most natural form rhythm the english and generally produces subtle but stable scanning meter can often show the basic fundamental pattern underlying but does not show the varying degrees stress well the differing pitches and lengths henry holiday lewis the hunting the snark anapestic tetrameter there debate over how useful multiplicity different feet describing for robert pinsky has argued that while dactyls are important classical english dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can better described based patterns iambs and feet which considers natural the actual rhythm significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described and many scholars have sought develop systems that would scan such vladimir nabokov noted that overlaid top the regular pattern stressed and unstressed syllables line verse was separate pattern accents resulting from the natural pitch the spoken and suggested that the term scud used distinguish unaccented stress from accented metrical patterns meter different traditions and genres poetry tend use different ranging from the shakespearean iambic pentameter and the homeric dactylic hexameter the anapestic tetrameter used many nursery however number variations the established meter are both provide emphasis attention given foot line and avoid boring for the stress foot may caesura may added sometimes place foot the final foot line may given feminine ending

beowulf alliterative verse rhyme alliterative verse assonance alliteration assonance and consonance are ways creating repetitive patterns they may used independent structural element reinforce

similar sounds placed the ends lines predictable locations within lines internal rhyme languages vary the richness their rhyming italian for has rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance limited set rhymes throughout lengthy the richness results from word endings that follow regular english with its irregular word endings adopted from other less rich the degree richness rhyming structures plays substantial role determining what poetic forms are commonly used that alliteration the repetition letters sounds the beginning two more words immediately succeeding each short the recurrence the same letter accented parts alliteration and assonance played key role structuring early norse and old english forms the alliterative patterns early germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration key part their that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances alliteration this can compared ornamental use alliteration most modern european where alliterative patterns are not formal carried through full alliteration particularly useful languages with less rich rhyming assonance where the use similar vowel sounds within word rather than similar sounds the beginning end was widely used skaldic poetry but goes back the homeric because verbs carry much the pitch the english assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements chinese poetry and useful translating chinese consonance occurs where consonant sound repeated throughout sentence without putting the sound only the front consonance provokes more subtle effect than alliteration and less useful structural rhyming schemes dante beatrice divine comedy paradiso rhyme scheme many including modern european languages and poets use rhyme set patterns structural element for specific poetic such ballads sonnets and rhyming couplets however the use structural rhyme not universal even within the european much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes classical greek and latin poetry did not use rhyme entered european poetry the high middle ages part under the influence the arabic language andalus modern arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development literary arabic the sixth century their rhyming qasidas some rhyming schemes have become associated with specific culture while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across cultures time some forms poetry carry consistent and defined rhyming such the chant royal the rubaiyat while other poetic forms have variable rhyme most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond sets the second and fourth lines quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not the quatrain said have rhyme this rhyme scheme the one for the rubaiyat similarly quatrain what known enclosed rhyme used such forms the petrarchan sonnet some types more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names their separate from the convention such the ottava rima and terza rima the types and use differing rhyming schemes discussed further the main article form poetic form more flexible modernist and modernist and continues less structured than previous literary many modern poets eschew recognisable structures and write free verse but poetry remains distinguished from prose its some regard for basic formal structures poetry will found even the best free however much such structures may appear have been similarly the best poetry written classic styles there will departures from strict form for emphasis among major structural elements used poetry are the the stanza verse paragraph and larger combinations stanzas lines such cantos also sometimes used are broader visual presentations words and calligraphy these basic units poetic form are often combined into larger called poetic forms poetic modes see following the sonnet haiku lines and stanzas poetry often separated into lines these lines may based the number metrical may emphasize rhyming pattern the ends lines may serve other particularly where the poem not written formal metrical lines can compare contrast thoughts expressed different can highlight change see the article line breaks for information about the division between lines poems are often organized into stanzas which are denominated the number lines thus collection two lines couplet distich three lines triplet tercet four lines quatrain and these lines may may not relate each other rhyme for couplet may two lines with identical meters which rhyme two lines held together common meter alexander blok ulitsa fonar apteka leiden other poems may organized into verse paragraphs which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not but the poetic tone instead established collection alliterations and rhymes established paragraph many medieval poems were written verse even where regular rhymes and rhythms were many forms stanzas are that the rhyming scheme other structural elements one stanza determine those succeeding examples such interlocking stanzas for the ghazal and the villanelle where refrain the case the refrains established the first stanza which then repeats subsequent related the use interlocking stanzas their use separate thematic parts for the strophe antistrophe and epode the ode form are often separated into one more some particularly lengthier formal poetry such some forms epic stanzas themselves are constructed

dissimilar not necessarily the beginning the the even lines contained internal rhyme set syllables not necessarily the end the each line had exactly six and each line ended the arrangement tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction the individual visual presentation visual poetry even before the advent the visual appearance poetry often added meaning acrostic poems conveyed meanings the initial letters lines letters other specific places arabic hebrew and chinese poetry the visual presentation finely calligraphed poems has played important part the overall effect many with the advent printing poets gained greater control over the produced visual presentations their visual elements have become important part the and many poets have sought use visual presentation for wide range some modernist poets have made the placement individual lines groups lines the page integral part the this complements the rhythm through visual caesuras various creates juxtapositions accentuate ambiguity irony simply create aesthetically pleasing its most extreme this can lead concrete poetry asemic writing diction poetic diction poetic diction treats the manner which language and refers not only the sound but also the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for registers poetry can range from strict employment ordinary speech favoured much century prosody through highly ornate uses medieval and renaissance poetic diction can include rhetorical devices such simile and metaphor well tones such irony aristotle wrote the poetics that the greatest thing far master since the rise modernism some poets have opted for poetic diction that
