imagination which was receptive the plurality diverse orders when compared the drama greek antiquity and french classicism forms are richer but theories tragedy aristotle poetics aristotle wrote his work poetics that tragedy characterized seriousness and involves great person who experiences reversal fortune peripeteia aristotle definition can include change fortune from bad good the eumenides but says that the change from good bad oedipus rex preferable because this induces pity and fear within the tragedy results catharsis emotional healing for the audience through their experience these emotions response the suffering the characters the according aristotle the structure the best tragedy should not simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing fear and pity for that peculiar this form this reversal fortune must caused the tragic hamartia which often mistranslated character flaw but more correctly translated mistake since the original greek etymology traces back hamartanein sporting term that refers archer spear thrower missing his according aristotle the change bad fortune which undergoes not due any moral defect but mistake some the reversal the inevitable but unforeseen result some action taken the also misconception that this reversal can brought about higher power the law the gods fate society but downfall brought about external cause aristotle describes this misadventure and not the tragic hero may achieve some revelation recognition anagnorisis knowing knowing knowing about human destiny and the will the aristotle terms this sort recognition change from ignorance awareness bond love poetics aristotle gave the following definition ancient greek the word tragedy which means tragedy imitation action that complete composed middle part and and possesses language made each its species separated different performed not through effecting through pity and fear the purification such common usage tragedy refers any story with sad whereas aristotelian tragedy the story must fit the set requirements laid out poetics this definition social drama cannot tragic because the hero victim circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society which lives and not upon the inner compulsions psychological religious which determine his progress towards knowledge and exactly what constitutes tragedy however frequently debated according

this nature can found phthiotides and peleus spectacle that like examples this nature are phorcides and prometheus hegel hegel the german philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach epistemology and also applied such methodology his theory his essay theory bradley first introduced the speaking world which bradley called the tragic collision and contrasted against the aristotelian notions the tragic hero and his her hamartia subsequent analyses the oresteia trilogy and antigone hegel however his seminal the phenomenology spirit argues for more complicated theory with two complementary branches though driven single dialectical differentiate greek tragedy from that which follows his later lectures formulate such theory tragedy conflict ethical represented ancient greek but shakespearean tragedy the conflict rendered one subject and individual personality which must manifest destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough defend the individual from hostile and capricious external the heroes ancient classical tragedy encounter situations they firmly decide favor the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally gleichberechtigt justified ethical power that confronts modern the other stand wealth more accidental within which one could act this way that the conflict which though occasioned external still essentially grounded the the new their obey their own simply because they are what they greek heroes also act accordance with but ancient tragedy such individuality contained
