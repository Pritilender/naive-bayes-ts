rather different neither which exercised much influence upon the other until the the first these two traditions turkish folk and the second turkish written for most the history turkish the salient difference between the folk and the written traditions has been the variety language the folk and was oral and remained free the influence persian and arabic and consequently those respective folk which far the dominant genre this basic fact led two major consequences terms poetic the poetic meters employed the folk poetic tradition were being quantitative syllabic verse opposed the qualitative verse employed the written poetic the basic structural unit folk poetry became the quatrain rather than the couplets beyit more commonly employed written furthermore turkish folk poetry has always had intimate connection with song most the poetry expressly composed and became great extent inseparable from the tradition turkish folk music contrast the tradition turkish folk turkish written prior the founding the republic turkey tended embrace the influence persian and arabic some this can seen far back the seljuk period the late early where official business was conducted the persian rather than and where court poet such who served under the century sultan ala din kay qubadh wrote language highly inflected with when the ottoman empire arose early the northwestern continued this the standard poetic for poetry was much the dominant genre the written tradition the folk were derived either directly from the persian literary tradition the gazel the mesnev indirectly through persian from the arabic the kas however the decision adopt these poetic forms wholesale led two important further the poetic meters aruz persian poetry were persian and based words were brought into the turkish language great turkish words rarely worked well within the system persian poetic out this confluence the ottoman turkish which was always highly distinct from standard was effectively this style writing under persian and arabic influence came known divan divan being the ottoman turkish word referring the collected works just turkish folk poetry was intimately bound with turkish folk did

abandoned the nomadic one example this the series folktales surrounding the figure young boy beset with the difficulties finding helping his mother keep the family house and dealing with the problems caused his another example the rather mysterious figure nasreddin trickster who often plays his anatolia nasreddin also reflects another significant change that had occurred between the days when the turkish people were nomadic and the days when they had largely become settled namely nasreddin muslim imam the turkic peoples had first become islamic people sometime around the evidenced from the clear islamic influence the century karakhanid work the kutadgu bilig wisdom royal glory written yusuf has hajib the religion henceforth came exercise enormous influence turkish society and particularly the heavily mystically oriented sufi and shi varieties the sufi for can seen clearly not only the tales concerning nasreddin but also the works yunus emre towering figure turkish literature and poet who lived the end the and beginning the probably the karamanid state central the the other can seen extensively the tradition the ozan who are roughly akin medieval european minstrels and who traditionally have had strong connection with the alevi faith which can seen something homegrown turkish variety however important note that turkish such neat division into sufi and scarcely for yunus emre considered some have been while the entire turkish ozan tradition permeated with the thought the bektashi sufi order which itself blending and sufi the word lover fact the term used for level members the bektashi because the turkish folk literature tradition extends more less unbroken line from about the century perhaps best consider the tradition from the perspective there are three basic genres the epic folk and the epic tradition the turkish epic has its roots the central asian epic tradition that gave rise the book dede korkut written azeri and recognizably similar modern turkish the form developed from the oral traditions the oghuz turks branch the turkic peoples which migrated towards western asia and eastern europe through transoxiana beginning the the book dede korkut endured the oral tradition the oghuz turks after settling citation needed alpamysh earlier translated into english and available the book dede korkut was the primary element the turkish epic tradition the caucasus and anatolia for several centuries concurrent the book dede korkut was the called epic which concerns the adventures ali son the blind exacted revenge for the blinding his the origins this epic are somewhat more mysterious than those the book dede korkut many believe have arisen anatolia sometime between the and more reliable though seems indicate that the story nearly old that the book dede korkut dating from around the dawn the complicating matters somewhat the fact that also the name poet the ozan tradition the epic tradition modern turkish literature may seen the epic shaykh bedreddin eyh bedreddin published the poet hikmet ran this long poem which concerns anatolian rebellion against the ottoman sultan mehmed modern yet draws upon the same minded traditions the anatolian people depicted the epic many the works the century novelist kemal such the novel memed hawk nce memed can considered modern prose epics folk poetry yunus emre the folk poetry tradition turkish indicated was strongly influenced the islamic sufi and furthermore partly evidenced the prevalence the still existent ozan tradition the dominant element turkish folk poetry has always been the development folk poetry which began emerge the century with such important writers yunus sultan and was given great boost may karamano mehmet bey declared turkish the official state language powerful karamanid subsequently many the greatest poets would continue emerge from this there broadly two traditions turkish folk the ozan tradition which although much influenced mentioned was for the most part secular the explicitly religious which emerged from the gathering places tekke the sufi religious orders and much the poetry and song the ozan tradition being almost exclusively oral until the remains there however few known from before that time whose names have survived together with their the aforementioned karacao lan who may the known the century dadalo who was one the last the great before the tradition began dwindle somewhat the late and several the were essentially minstrels who travelled through anatolia performing their songs the lama mandolin like instrument whose paired strings are considered have symbolic religious significance bektashi despite the decline the ozan tradition the experienced significant revival the century thanks such outstanding figures veysel mahzuni erif and many kaygusuz abdal the explicitly religious folk tradition tekke literature shared similar basis with the ozan tradition that the poems were generally intended generally religious making them somewhat akin western hymns turkish ilahi one major difference from the ozan tradition however from the very the poems the tekke tradition were written this was because they were produced revered religious figures the literate environment the tekke opposed the milieu the ozan tradition where the majority could not read the major figures the tradition tekke literature yunus emre who one the most important figures all turkish leyman elebi who wrote highly popular long poem called ves the means but more commonly known the mevlid concerning the birth the islamic prophet muhammad kaygusuz abdal who widely considered the founder bektashi and pir sultan abdal whom many consider the pinnacle that folklore turkish folklore nasreddin hoca the tradition jokes legends and the the turkish language very perhaps the most popular figure the tradition the aforementioned nasreddin known nasreddin hoca teacher who the central character thousands generally appears person though seeming somewhat stupid those who must deal with actually proves have special wisdom all his one nasreddin neighbor asked you have any old answered can have asked the need some make ointment you have answered gave old vinegar whoever wanted have had for forty would karag and hacivat similar the nasreddin and arising from similar religious are the bektashi which the members the bektashi religious represented through character simply named bekta are depicted having unusual and unorthodox one that often challenges the values islam and another popular element turkish folklore the shadow theater centered around the two characters karag and hacivat who both represent stock characters karag who hails from small something country while hacivat more sophisticated popular legend has that the two characters are actually based two real persons who worked either for osman the founder the ottoman dynasty for his successor orhan the construction palace possibly mosque bursa the early the two workers supposedly spent much their time entertaining the other and were funny and popular that they interfered with work the and were subsequently beheaded supposedly however their bodies then picked their severed heads and walked ottoman literature the two primary streams ottoman written literature are poetry and prose the poetry divan was far the dominant moreover should noted until the ottoman prose did not contain any examples fiction that there were counterparts for the european romance short story novel though analogous genres some exist both the turkish folk tradition and divan divan poetry poetry the ottoman empire ottoman divan poetry was highly ritualized and symbolic art from the persian poetry that largely inspired inherited wealth symbols whose meanings and both similitude mura ten and opposition tez were more less examples prevalent symbols some oppose one another among the nightingale the rose the world cihan lem the rosegarden listan the ascetic hid the dervish dervi the opposition the and the suggests divan much like turkish folk was heavily influenced sufi thought one the primary characteristics divan however the persian poetry before was its mingling the mystical sufi element with profane and even erotic thus the pairing the and the simultaneously suggests two different the relationship between the fervent lover the and the inconstant beloved the the relationship between the individual sufi practitioner who often characterized sufism and god who considered the ultimate source and object similarly the refers simultaneously the physical world and this physical world considered the abode sorrow and while the refers simultaneously literal garden and the garden paradise the suffering often seen both literally and the while the seen being the divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition many such images within strict metrical thus allowing numerous potential meanings brief example the following line sra the century judge and poet efendi bir var lemde nava diwan suleiman the magnificent the nightingale only implied being the while the shown capable inflicting pain with its thorns the seen having both positive aspects and thus analogous the garden and negative aspects rosegarden full and thus different from the garden for the development divan poetry over the more than years its that the ottomanist walter andrews points study still its clearly defined movements and periods have not yet been decided early the history the the persian influence was very but this was mitigated somewhat through the influence poets such the azerbaijani nes and the uyghur ali both whom offered strong arguments for the poetic status the turkic languages against the venerated partly result such divan poetry its strongest from the the came display unique balance persian and turkish until the persian influence began predominate again the early turkish ottoman and chagatay although they had been inspired and influenced classical persian would superficial judgment consider the former blind imitators the often limited vocabulary and common and the same world imagery and subject matter based mainly islamic sources were shared all poets islamic despite the lack certainty regarding the stylistic movements and periods divan however certain highly different styles are clear and can perhaps seen exemplified certain fuz turkmen unique poet who wrote with equal skill ottoman persian and and who came influential persian divan poetry poet great rhetorical power and linguistic subtlety whose skill using the established tropes the divan tradition quite representative the poetry the time leyman the magnificent poet considered the master the kas kind panegyric well being known for his harshly satirical which led his execution poet who wrote number socially oriented poems critical the stagnation period ottoman history revolutionary poet the tulip era ottoman who infused the rather lite and abstruse language divan poetry with numerous populist elements eyh lib poet the mevlev sufi order whose work considered the culmination the highly complex called indian sebk the vast majority divan poetry was lyric either gazel which make the greatest part the repertoire the kas there however other common most particularly the mesnev kind verse romance and thus variety narrative poetry the two most notable examples this form are the leyl mecnun and the beauty and eyh early ottoman prose prose the ottoman empire evliya elebi ottoman until the ottoman prose never managed develop the extent that contemporary divan poetry large part the reason for this was that much prose was expected adhere the rules sec also transliterated seci rhymed prose type writing descended from the arabic saj and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun there must rhyme nevertheless there was tradition prose the literature the this tradition was exclusively nonfictional the fiction tradition was limited narrative number such nonfictional prose genres the rih history tradition which there are many notable including the century historian and the century historians tib elebi and the sey travelogue which the outstanding example the century seyah evliya elebi the sef related genre specific the journeys and experiences ottoman ambassador and which best exemplified the paris mesi yirmisekiz mehmed elebi ambassador the court louis france the siy kind political treatise describing the functionings state and offering advice for early seljuk example which the century siy written persian nizam mulk vizier the seljuk rulers alp arslan and malik shah the tezk collection short biographies notable some the most notable which were the century tezkiret biographies and elebi the collection writings and letters similar the western tradition belles lettres the zara collection debates either religious philosophical nature the century and western influence poetry the ottoman empire prose the ottoman empire edict lhane ottoman sultan lmecid ottoman empire the early the ottoman empire had become moribund attempts right this situation had begun during the reign sultan selim iii from but were continuously thwarted the powerful janissary corps only after sultan mahmud had abolished the janissary corps was the way paved for truly effective reforms ottoman tanz these reforms finally came the empire during the tanzimat period when much the ottoman system was reorganized along largely french lines the tanzimat reforms were designed both modernize the empire and forestall foreign along with reforms the ottoman serious reforms were also undertaken the which had become nearly moribund the empire broadly these literary reforms can grouped into two changes brought the language ottoman written the introduction into ottoman literature previously unknown ziya pasha turkish reformist kemal turkish writer journalist political activist the reforms the literary language were undertaken because the ottoman turkish language was thought the reformists have effectively lost its had become more divorced than ever from its original basis with writers using more and more words and even grammatical structures derived from persian and rather than meanwhile however the turkish folk literature tradition away from the capital constantinople came seen accordingly many the reformists called for written literature turn away from the divan tradition and towards the folk this call for change can for famous statement the poet and reformist ziya pasha our language not what makes our poetic canon not gazel and kas but rather kayaba leme and which some our poets thinking them but just let those with the ability exert the effort this road and what powerful personalities will soon the same time this which reveals something burgeoning national consciousness was being new literary genres were being introduced into ottoman primarily the novel and the short this trend began with the translation into ottoman turkish fran ois nelon novel les aventures maque yusuf mil grand vizier sultan laziz what widely recognized the first turkish taa fitnat and fitnat emsettin sami was published just ten years the introduction such new genres into turkish literature can seen part trend towards westernization that continues felt turkey this due historically close ties with france strengthened during the crimean war was french literature that came constitute the major western influence turkish literature throughout the latter half the many the same movements prevalent france during this period also had their equivalents the ottoman the developing ottoman prose for the influence romanticism can seen during the tanzimat and that the realist and naturalist movements subsequent the poetic the other was the influence the symbolist and parnassian movements that became many the writers the tanzimat period wrote several different genres for the poet kemal also wrote the important novel awakening while the journalist brahim inasi noted for the first modern turkish play the one act comedy air evlenmesi the similar the novelist ahmed midhat efendi wrote important novels each the major romanticism hasan hud inde hasan the the mystery within the mystery realism hen yedi nda just seventeen years old and naturalism observations this diversity due the tanzimat wish disseminate much the new literature the hopes that would contribute revitalization ottoman social structures early century turkish literature poetry the ottoman empire prose the ottoman empire most the roots modern turkish literature were formed between the years when the first collective literary movement and when the republic turkey was officially broadly there were three primary literary movements during this the edebiyy ced new movement the fecr dawn the movement the mill edebiyy national movement the new literature movement tevfik fikret nun nun the edebiyy ced new movement began with the founding the magazine servet scientific which was largely devoted both intellectual and along the western accordingly the literary under the direction the poet tevfik fikret were geared towards creating style high art the poetry the which tevfik fikret and were the most influential was heavily influenced the french parnassian movement and the called decadent poets the prose the other particularly halit ziya gil were primarily influenced although the writer mehmed rauf did write the first turkish example psychological novel eyl september the language the edebiyy ced movement remained strongly influenced ottoman result the article edebiyy hukuk literature and translated from french and published servet the pressure censorship was brought bear and the magazine was closed down the government the ottoman sultan abd lhamid though was closed for only six the writers each went their own way the and the edebiyy ced movement came the dawn the future movement the february edition the servet magazine gathering young soon known the fecr dawn the group released manifesto which they declared their opposition the edebiyy ced movement and their adherence the sanat muhteremdir art personal and though this credo was little more than variation the french writer ophile gautier doctrine art pour art art for the group was nonetheless opposed the blanket importation western forms and and essentially sought create recognizably turkish the fecr group however never made clear and unequivocal declaration its goals and and lasted only few years before its adherents each went their own individual the two outstanding figures emerge from the movement ahmed and yakup kadri the national literature movement gen kalemler sultan lhamid had instituted constitutional government and the parliament subsequently elected was composed almost entirely members the committee union and progress also known the young turks the young turks rkler had opposed themselves the increasingly authoritarian ottoman and soon came identify themselves with specifically turkish national along with this notion developed the idea turkish and even pan turkish nation millet and the literature this period came known national mill edebiyy was during this period that the and inflected ottoman turkish language was definitively turned away from vehicle for written and that literature began assert itself being specifically rather than this movement crystallized around the magazine gen kalemler young which was begun the city sel nik the three writers who were most representative the ziya kalp sociologist and mer seyfettin story and ali canip ntem gen kalemler first article entitled new yeni lisan pointed out that turkish literature had previously looked for inspiration either the east the ottoman divan the west the edebiyy ced and fecr movements without ever turning turkey this latter was the national literature primary the intrinsically nationalistic character gen kalemler however quickly took decidedly chauvinistic turn and other many like yakup kadri had been part the fecr movement began emerge from within the matrix the national literature movement counter this some the more influential writers come out this less far rightist branch the national literature movement were the poet mehmet emin yurdakul the early feminist novelist halide edip var and the story writer and novelist nuri ntekin republican literature following the ottoman defeat the first world war the victorious entente powers began the process carving the lands and placing them under their own spheres influence opposition this the military leader mustafa kemal command the growing turkish national movement whose roots lay partly the young organized the turkish war independence this war ended with the official ending the ottoman the expulsion the entente and the founding the republic the literature the new republic emerged largely from the independence national literature with its roots simultaneously the turkish folk tradition and the western notion one important change turkish literature was enacted when mustafa kemal initiated the creation and dissemination modified version the latin alphabet replace the based ottoman over this together with changes system would lead more widespread literacy the country albeit the access new generations was broken off with immense corpus written culture years prose prose the republic turkey hawk kemal tutunamayanlar atay the prose the early years the republic turkey was essentially continuation the national literature with realism and naturalism this trend culminated the novel yaban the wilds yakup kadri this novel can seen the precursor two trends that would soon social realism and the village the wren nuri ntekin addresses similar theme with the works narrative has detailed and precise with realistic the social realist movement perhaps best represented the story writer sait faik whose work sensitively and realistically treats the lives cosmopolitan lower classes and ethnic minorities subjects which led some criticism the contemporary nationalistic the tradition the village the other arose somewhat its name the village deals generally realistic with life the villages and small towns the major writers this tradition are kemal tahir orhan kemal and kemal has earned fame outside turkey not only for his many
