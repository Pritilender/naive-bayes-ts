literature	writing process navigation search first attempts understand what now called the writing process began the early now key concept the teaching writing and the research composition studies process scholars were instrumental shifting the focus attention from written products writing composing process research was pioneered scholars such janet emig the composing processes twelfth graders sondra perl the composing processes unskilled college and linda flower and john hayes cognitive process theory since writing interrelates with external students benefit most from writing instruction when provides them with sense how what they write can connected the world outside the according ann berthoff the job teacher design sequences assignments which let our students discover what language can what they can with the rest this page will focus the writing process term used donald murray published brief manifesto titled teach writing process not phrase which became rallying cry for many writing ten years maxine hairston argued that the teaching writing had undergone paradigm moving from focus written products writing for many was assumed that the writing process generally operated some variation three five stages the configuration below prewriting drafting see draft document revising see revision editing proofreading publishing what now called research demonstrates that seldom accurate describe these stages fixed steps straightforward rather they are more accurately conceptualized overlapping parts complex whole parts recursive process that are repeated multiple times

the situation problem such the invocation particular audience oversimplified approach such finding theme and completing the writing two pages the cognition flower and hayes set out discover the differences between good and bad they came three results from their which suggests that good writers envelop the three following characteristics when solving their rhetorical good writers respond all the rhetorical problems good writers build their problem representation creating particularly rich network goals for affecting and good writers represent the problem not only more but flower and hayes suggest that composition instructors need consider showing students how explore and define their own even within the constraints they believe that writers discover what they want energetically exploring the entire problem before them and building for themselves unique image the problem they want criticism cognitive model patricia bizzell argues that even though educators may have understanding how the writing process educators assume that this knowledge can answer the question about the writer makes certain choices certain since writing always situated within discourse community she discusses how the flower and hayes model relies what called the process translating ideas into visible this process occurs when students treat written english set containers into which pour bizzell contends that this process remains the emptiest the cognitive process since contextualizes the original context the written negating the original intent and she argues that writing does not much contribute thinking provide occasion for social model writing process the aim collaborative learning helps students find more control their learning even grammar has social turn may that

processes the writer asking students verbally reflect those jimmie killingsworth also speaks this approach when states product literacy process killingsworth addresses the emergence the not slogan the beginning the new era writing instruction where conferences and writing centers used orality means process scholars such charles his work behavioristic pedagogy for scribal and margaret walters also lend this attend the notion writing being driven texts that are oral pedagogies challenge such especially when referring many scholars focus the relationship between writer and such walter ong lisa andrea linda and doug margaret walters states that students have not only negotiate the intended text but also the intended synthesis between real with its focus the and imagined created with the focus the she acknowledges pedagogy instrumental concept for composition this pedagogy described dialogic problem solving which the variance between what the writer intends and what the writer writes subjected dialogue aimed its theorist makhail bahktin accounts for dialogic problem solving the problem speech genres thus all real and integral understanding actively and the speaker himself oriented

that the negotiation meaning between text and interpreting reader and not the literariness the text and its pure perception the the writing thus social activity that relies the negotiation between writer and considering both novice and professional deborah tannen affirms that scholars the field writing use orality throughout their professional many including graduate students and use this forum process they present conferences either introduce ideas receive comments and questions that the speaker then takes into consideration she proceeds the product publication the print ultimately orality has played integral role the process expressivist process theory writing according the expressivist the process writing centered the this involves the writer changing the sense that voice and identity are established and the writer has sense his her this theory became popular the late and early according richard article four philosophies the focus expressivism for writers have credible honest and personal moreover proponents the expressivist process view this theory way for students become fulfilled and healthy both emotionally and those who teach this process often focus journaling and other classroom activities focus student discovery and low stakes prominent figures the field include john ken macrorie lou donald stewart and peter elbow historical approaches composition and process historical response process concerned primarily with the manner which writing has been shaped and governed historical and social these forces are dynamic and and therefore render any static iteration process notable scholars that have conducted this type inquiry include media theorists such marshall mcluhan walter ong gregory ulmer and cynthia selfe much for centered around the impact written language oral degrees which various media are accessible and and the ways which electronic media determine communication his evaluation technology shaper human societies and psyches indicates strong connection between historical forces and literacy writing process for students with disabilities teaching the writing process students with disabilities can however research suggests that number strategies can used help these students succeed both the traditional settings and postsecondary wery and nietfeld discuss the implementation regulated learning strategies for students with learning while much their research focuses students settings they emphasize the importance aloud protocols and point toward the use multimodal composition including students recording themselves learning and writing about topics high interest and using software create pictures and diagrams part their writing using technological interventions frequent suggestion from many hetzroni and shrieber take close look how basic word processing software such microsoft word make significant difference the pace and comfort learning disabled students make elementary and junior high they quote longitudinal study owston and wideman showing greater degree expressiveness and implementation writing strategies not seen with the same frequency with pencil and paper they also point raskind and higgins who see similar gains among secondary offering linkage college students with disabilities intensive marchisan advocates using computers part the revising process minimize the frustration level grammatical montgomery and marks write that students with learning disabilities see their writing improved the use word processing and graphic design software help students grasp the writing process and ultimately produce longer and more fluid applications the technology but are not limited having students record their work tape and play back themselves help with create stories pertaining different moods and contrast electronically with other work with their own have all shown furthermore mason harris and graham reveal research indicating the effectiveness regulated strategy development for adolescents who struggle with writing processes due learning there are six recursive strategies explored this develop background discuss model memorize support and independent order effectively model the teachers must work out strategies aloud with student teachers then help students memorize specific strategies having students make personal statements about how they might able apply the strategies their own particular part this comes from the use easy remember acronyms such pow pick organize write and say and the scan strategy for persuasive essays does make connected can you add note troia and graham also emphasize the importance teaching learning disabled students specific planning strategies compensate for the more organic acquisition these skills neurotypical citing examples known authors such kathy reichs who created the characters which the drama bones based they illustrated the importance setting and planning that many writers take for explicitly teaching three key planning strategies brainstorming and scott and vitale highlight the recursivity the writing process breaking the writing process down into five commonly referenced stages prewriting drafting revising editing and the steps are laid out writing creating helpful graphic organizer show how the different steps fit interestingly the prewriting stage takes half the wheel with categories setting goals and each these areas has further thereby emphasizing the importance prewriting and visually attempting stave off one the most common challenges for learning disabled students adequately planning out their work before delving into subject the back publishing described sharing work with the which secondary environment could easily present blog other collaborative documentation autistic autobiographies appealing document sharing may for students with autism being able contextualize life story the context their disability may prove the most powerful expression the writing process rose illustrates that creating narrative identity conventional sense quite difficult for autistic students because their challenges with interpersonal the narratives autistic students can sometimes troubling neurotyprical peers with whom they share their rose notes quoting autistic autobiographer dawn sometimes reaching out and communicating can bring sadness and some family and after reading the manuscript for this were deeply saddened learn how experienced rose points the known work temple grandin and donna williams examples autistic autobiographies and analogizes toward the usefulness autobiographies championed susan stanford friedman show suggesting the same can learned through autistic she writes that such works can minimize the pathologisation which can easily occur between autistic students and neuroytpical peers can broken down such rose directly argue here that awareness the relationality autistic life and the recognition its corollary status testimonio and attention the material relations the production these texts particularly useful assessing their social from rhetorical perspective the use for students with disabilities not just autistic seems would appear foster sense community among students with disabilities and helping these voices brought from the margins similarly the way mike rose refers students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their needs lives the boundary editing editing has several levels operates depending the publishers process this typically levels the lowest level the only one most people think that editing really but fact the least important the various editing see more editing however this also incomplete with respect many publishers full the often called line editing the stage the writing process where the writer makes
