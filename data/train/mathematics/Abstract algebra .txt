abstract algebra navigation search abstrakt algebra cube algebra which broad division mathematics abstract algebra common name for the area that studies algebraic structures their own such structures include groups rings fields modules vector spaces and algebras the specific term abstract algebra was coined the beginning the century distinguish this area from the other parts the term modern algebra has also been used denote abstract two mathematical subject areas that study the properties algebraic structures viewed whole are universal algebra and category theory algebraic together with the associated homomorphisms form categories category theory powerful formalism for studying and comparing different algebraic contents history early group theory modern algebra basic concepts applications see also references sources external links history other parts concrete problems and examples have played important roles the development abstract through the end the nineteenth many perhaps most these problems were some way related the theory algebraic major themes solving systems linear which led linear algebra attempts find formulae for solutions general polynomial equations higher degree that resulted discovery groups abstract manifestations symmetry arithmetical investigations quadratic and higher degree forms and diophantine equations that directly produced the notions ring and ideal numerous textbooks abstract algebra start with axiomatic definitions various algebraic structures and then proceed establish their this creates false impression that algebra axioms had come first and then served motivation and basis further the true order historical development was almost exactly the for the hypercomplex numbers the nineteenth century had kinematic and physical motivations but challenged most theories that are now recognized parts algebra started collections disparate facts from various branches acquired common theme that served core around which various results were and finally became unified basis common set archetypical example this progressive synthesis can seen the history group theory early group theory there were several threads the early development group modern language loosely corresponding number theory theory equations and geometry leonhard euler considered algebraic operations numbers modulo modular arithmetic his generalization fermat little theorem these investigations were taken much further carl friedrich gauss who considered the structure multiplicative groups residues mod and established many properties cyclic and more general abelian groups that arise this his investigations composition binary quadratic forms gauss explicitly stated the associative law for the composition but like euler before seems have been more interested concrete results than general leopold kronecker gave definition abelian group the context ideal class groups number generalizing but appears did not tie his definition with previous work particularly permutation considering the same heinrich weber realized the connection and gave similar definition that involved the cancellation property but omitted the existence the inverse element which was sufficient his context finite permutations were studied joseph louis lagrange his paper flexions sur solution brique des quations thoughts the algebraic solution devoted solutions algebraic which introduced lagrange resolvents lagrange goal was understand why equations third and fourth degree admit formulae for and identified key objects permutations the important novel step taken lagrange this paper was the abstract view the symbols and not however did not consider composition serendipitously the first edition edward waring meditationes algebraicae meditations algebra appeared the same with expanded version published waring proved the main theorem symmetric functions and specially considered the relation between the roots quartic equation and its resolvent moire sur solution des quations memoire the solving equations alexandre vandermonde developed the theory symmetric functions from slightly different but like with the goal understanding solvability algebraic kronecker claimed that the study modern algebra began with this first paper cauchy states quite clearly that vandermonde had priority over lagrange for this remarkable which eventually led the study group paolo ruffini was the first person develop the theory permutation groups and like his also the context solving algebraic his goal was establish the impossibility algebraic solution general algebraic equation degree greater than route this goal introduced the notion the order element conjugacy the cycle decomposition elements permutation groups and the notions primitive and imprimitive and proved some important theorems relating these such subgroup whose order divisible then contains element order note however that got without formalizing the concept even permutation the next step was taken variste galois although his work remained unpublished until when considered for the first time what now called the closure property group which expressed the theory permutation groups received further reaching development the hands augustin cauchy and camille jordan both through introduction new concepts primarily great wealth results about special classes permutation groups and even some general among other jordan defined notion isomorphism still the context permutation groups incidentally was who put the term group wide the abstract notion group appeared for the first time arthur cayley papers cayley realized that group need not permutation group even finite and may instead consist matrices whose algebraic such multiplication and systematically investigated succeeding much later cayley would revisit the question whether abstract groups were more general than permutation and establish any group isomorphic group modern algebra the end the and the beginning the century saw tremendous shift the methodology abstract algebra emerged around the start the under the name modern algebra its study was part the drive for more intellectual rigor initially the assumptions classical algebra which the whole mathematics and major parts the natural sciences depend took the form axiomatic systems longer satisfied with establishing properties concrete mathematicians started turn their attention general formal definitions certain algebraic structures began emerge the for results about various groups permutations came seen instances general theorems that concern general notion abstract group questions structure and classification various mathematical objects came these processes were occurring throughout all but became especially pronounced formal definition through primitive operations and axioms were proposed for many basic algebraic such groups rings and fields hence such things group theory and ring theory took their places pure mathematics the algebraic investigations general fields ernst steinitz and commutative and then general rings david hilbert emil artin and emmy noether building the work ernst kummer leopold kronecker and richard dedekind who had considered ideals commutative and georg frobenius and issai schur concerning representation theory came define abstract these developments the last quarter the century and the first quarter century were systematically exposed bartel van der waerden moderne algebra the volume monograph published that forever changed for the mathematical world the meaning the word algebra from the theory equations the theory algebraic structures basic concepts algebraic structures abstracting away various amounts mathematicians have created theories various algebraic structures that apply many for almost all systems studied are sets which the theorems set theory apply those sets that have certain binary operation defined them form magmas which the concepts concerning well those concerning apply can add additional constraints the algebraic such associativity form semigroups associativity identity and inverses form groups and other more complex with additional more theorems could but the generality the hierarchy algebraic objects terms creates hierarchy the corresponding for the theorems group theory apply rings algebraic objects that have two binary operations with certain since ring group over one its mathematicians choose balance between the amount generality and the richness the examples algebraic structures with single binary operation are magmas quasigroups monoids semigroups groups more complicated examples rings fields modules vector spaces algebras over fields associative algebras lie algebras lattices boolean algebras applications because its abstract algebra used many fields mathematics and for algebraic topology uses algebraic objects study the recently proved poincar conjecture asserts that the fundamental group which encodes information about can used determine whether manifold sphere algebraic number theory studies various number rings that generalize the set using tools algebraic number theory andrew wiles proved fermat last theorem groups are used represent symmetry and the usage group theory could simplify differential gauge theory the requirement local symmetry can used deduce the equations describing the groups that describe those symmetries are lie groups and the study lie groups and lie algebras reveals much about the physical for the number force carriers theory equal dimension the lie and these bosons
