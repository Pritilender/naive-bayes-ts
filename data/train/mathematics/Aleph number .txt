mathematics	aleph number navigation search aleph one set theory discipline within the aleph numbers are sequence numbers used represent the cardinality infinite sets they are named after the symbol used denote the hebrew letter aleph the cardinality the natural numbers read aleph naught aleph null aleph zero the next larger cardinality one then and continuing this possible define cardinal number for every ordinal number described the concept goes back georg cantor who defined the notion cardinality and realized that infinite sets can have different the aleph numbers differ from the infinity commonly found algebra and alephs measure the sizes infinity the other commonly defined extreme limit the real number line applied function sequence that diverges increases without extreme point the extended real number line contents aleph naught aleph one the continuum hypothesis aleph aleph for general fixed points omega role axiom choice see also references external links naught the cardinality the set all natural and infinite cardinal the set all finite ordinals called has cardinality set has cardinality and only countably infinite that there bijection one between and the natural such sets include the set all prime numbers the set all integers the set all rational numbers the set algebraic numbers the set binary strings all finite and the set all finite subsets any given countably infinite these infinite and are among the countably infinite the axiom countable choice weaker version the axiom choice holds then smaller than any other infinite aleph one the cardinality the set all countable ordinal numbers called this itself ordinal number larger than all countable uncountable set therefore distinct from the definition implies zermelo fraenkel set theory without the axiom that cardinal number between and the axiom choice can further proved that the class cardinal numbers totally ordered and thus the smallest infinite cardinal using can show one the most useful properties the set any countable subset has upper bound this follows from the fact that countable union countable sets one the most common applications this fact analogous the situation every finite set natural numbers has maximum which also natural and finite unions finite sets are actually useful somewhat example application closing with respect countable trying explicitly describe the algebra generated arbitrary collection subsets see borel hierarchy this harder than most explicit descriptions generation algebra vector spaces groups etc because those cases only have close with respect finite products and the the process involves for each countable via transfinite induction set throwing all possible countable unions and and taking the union all that over all the continuum hypothesis continuum hypothesis beth number the cardinality the set real numbers cardinality the continuum not clear where this number fits the aleph number follows from zfc zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom choice that the celebrated continuum equivalent the identity independent can neither proven nor disproven within the context that axiom system provided that zfc that consistent with zfc was demonstrated kurt del when showed that its negation not theorem that independent zfc was demonstrated paul cohen when conversely that the itself not theorem zfc the then method forcing aleph conventionally the smallest infinite ordinal denoted and the cardinal number the least upper bound among aleph the first uncountable cardinal number that can demonstrated within fraenkel set theory not equal the cardinality the set all real numbers for any positive integer can consistently assume that and moreover possible assume large are only forced avoid setting certain special cardinals with cofinality meaning there unbounded function from see easton theorem aleph for general define for arbitrary ordinal number must define the successor cardinal operation which assigns any cardinal number the next larger well ordered cardinal the axiom choice holds this the next larger can then define the aleph numbers and for infinite limit the infinite initial ordinal written its cardinality written see initial ordinal zfc the function bijection between the ordinals and the infinite fixed points omega for any ordinal have many cases strictly greater than for for any successor ordinal this there however some limit ordinals which are fixed points the omega because the fixed point lemma for normal functions the first such the limit the sequence any weakly inaccessible cardinal also fixed point the aleph this can shown zfc suppose weakly inaccessible were successor ordinal then would successor cardinal and hence not weakly were limit ordinal less than then its cofinality and thus the cofinality would less than and would not regular and thus not weakly thus and consequently which makes fixed role axiom choice the cardinality any infinite ordinal number aleph every aleph the cardinality some the least these its initial ordinal any set whose cardinality aleph equinumerous with ordinal and thus each finite set but does not have aleph its the assumption that the cardinality each infinite set aleph number equivalent over the existence ordering every which turn equivalent the axiom choice zfc set which includes the axiom implies that every infinite set has aleph number its cardinality equinumerous with its initial and thus the initial ordinals the aleph numbers serve class representatives for all possible infinite cardinal when cardinality studied without the axiom longer possible prove that each infinite set has some aleph number its the sets whose cardinality aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can the method scott trick sometimes used alternative way construct representatives for cardinal numbers the setting see also regular cardinal
