algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces homeomorphism though usually most classify homotopy equivalence although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra study topological using topology solve algebraic problems sometimes also algebraic for allows for convenient proof that any subgroup free group again free contents main branches algebraic topology homotopy groups homology cohomology manifolds knot theory complexes method algebraic invariants setting category theory applications algebraic topology notable algebraic topologists important theorems algebraic topology see also notes references further reading main branches algebraic topology below are some the main areas studied algebraic topology homotopy groups homotopy group homotopy groups are used algebraic topology classify topological spaces the first and simplest homotopy group the fundamental group which records information about loops intuitively homotopy groups record information about the basic topological homology homology algebraic topology and abstract algebra homology part from greek homos identical certain general procedure associate sequence abelian groups modules with given mathematical object such topological space group cohomology cohomology homology theory and algebraic cohomology general term for sequence abelian groups defined from chain complex that cohomology defined the abstract study cochains cocycles and coboundaries cohomology can viewed method assigning algebraic invariants topological space that has more refined algebraic structure than does homology cohomology arises from the algebraic dualization the construction less abstract cochains the fundamental sense should assign the chains homology manifolds manifold manifold topological space that near each point resembles euclidean space more each point dimensional manifold has neighbourhood that homeomorphic the euclidean space dimension lines and circles but not figure eights are dimensional two dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces examples include the plane the sphere and the torus which can all realized three but also the klein bottle and real projective plane which cannot realized three but can realized four knot theory knot theory knot theory the study mathematical knots while inspired knots that appear daily life shoelaces and knot differs that the ends are joined together that cannot precise mathematical knot embedding circle dimensional euclidean space two mathematical knots are equivalent one can transformed into the other via deformation upon itself known ambient isotopy these transformations correspond manipulations knotted string that not involve cutting the string passing the string through complexes simplicial complex complex simplicial complex topological space certain constructed gluing points line segments triangles and their dimensional counterparts see simplicial complexes should not confused with the more abstract notion simplicial set appearing modern simplicial homotopy the purely combinatorial counterpart simplicial complex abstract simplicial complex complex type topological space introduced whitehead meet the needs homotopy theory this class spaces broader and has some better categorical properties than simplicial complexes but still retains combinatorial nature that allows for computation often with much smaller method algebraic invariants older name for the subject was combinatorial topology implying emphasis how space was constructed from simpler ones the modern standard tool for such construction the complex the and there was growing emphasis investigating topological spaces finding correspondences from them algebraic groups which led the change name algebraic the combinatorial topology name still sometimes used emphasize algorithmic approach based decomposition the algebraic one finds correspondence between spaces and groups that respects the relation homeomorphism more general homotopy this allows one recast statements about topological spaces into statements about which have great deal manageable often making these statement easier two major ways which this can done are through fundamental groups more generally homotopy theory and through homology and cohomology groups the fundamental groups give basic information about the structure topological but they are often nonabelian and can difficult work the fundamental group simplicial complex does have finite presentation homology and cohomology the other are abelian and many important cases finitely finitely generated abelian groups are completely classified and are particularly easy work setting category theory all constructions algebraic topology are functorial the notions category functor and natural transformation originated fundamental groups and homology and cohomology groups are not only invariants the underlying topological the sense that two topological spaces which are homeomorphic have the same associated but their associated morphisms also correspond continuous mapping spaces induces group homomorphism the associated and these homomorphisms can used show existence much more existence one the first mathematicians work with different types cohomology was georges rham one can use the differential structure smooth manifolds via rham cohomology ech sheaf cohomology investigate the solvability differential equations defined the manifold rham showed that all these approaches were interrelated and for oriented the betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same betti numbers those derived through rham this was extended the when eilenberg and steenrod generalized this they defined homology and cohomology functors equipped with natural transformations subject certain axioms weak equivalence spaces passes isomorphism homology verified that all existing homology theories satisfied these and then proved that such axiomatization uniquely characterized the applications algebraic topology classic applications algebraic topology the brouwer fixed point theorem every continuous map from the unit disk itself has fixed the free rank the homology group simplicial complex the betti number which allows one calculate the euler characteristic one can use the differential structure smooth manifolds via rham cohomology ech sheaf cohomology investigate the solvability differential equations defined the manifold manifold orientable when the dimensional integral homology group the and orientable when the sphere admits vanishing continuous unit vector field and only for this sometimes called the hairy ball theorem the borsuk ulam theorem any continuous map from the sphere euclidean space identifies least one pair antipodal any subgroup free group this result quite because the statement purely algebraic yet the simplest proof namely any free group may realized the fundamental group graph the main theorem covering spaces tells that every subgroup the fundamental group some covering space but every such again therefore its fundamental group the other hand this type application also handled more simply the use covering morphisms groupoids and that technique has yielded subgroup theorems not yet proved methods algebraic see the book higgins listed under topological combinatorics notable algebraic topologists frank adams enrico betti armand borel
