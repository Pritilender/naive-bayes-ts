the classical and elementary classical analytic geometry also known coordinate geometry cartesian geometry the study geometry using coordinate system this contrasts with synthetic geometry analytic geometry widely used physics and engineering and the foundation most modern fields including algebraic differential discrete and computational geometry usually the cartesian coordinate system applied manipulate equations for planes straight lines and squares often two and sometimes three geometrically one studies the euclidean plane dimensions and euclidean space dimensions taught school analytic geometry can explained more concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes numerical way and extracting numerical information from numerical definitions and the numerical however might also vector shape that the algebra the real numbers can employed yield results about the linear continuum geometry relies the cantor dedekind axiom contents history basic principles coordinates equations curves distance and angle transformations intersections intercepts themes example modern analytic geometry see also notes references books articles external links history the greek mathematician menaechmus solved problems and proved theorems using method that had strong resemblance the use coordinates and has sometimes been maintained that had introduced analytic apollonius perga determinate section dealt with problems manner that may called analytic geometry one with the question finding points line that were ratio the apollonius the conics further developed method that similar analytic geometry that his work sometimes thought have anticipated the work descartes some years his application reference diameter and tangent essentially different from our modern use coordinate where the distances measured along the diameter from the point tangency are the and the segments parallel the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent rhetorical equations however although apollonius came close developing analytic did not manage since did not take into account negative magnitudes and every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon given curve posteriori instead priori that equations were determined but curves were not determined coordinates variables and equations were subsidiary notions applied specific geometric the eleventh century persian mathematician omar saw strong relationship between geometry and and was moving the right direction when helped close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra with his geometric solution the general cubic equations but the decisive step came later with analytic geometry has traditionally been attributed ren descartes descartes made significant progress with the methods essay entitled geometrie one the three accompanying essays published together with his discourse the method for rightly directing reason and searching for truth the sciences commonly referred discourse method this written his native french tongue and its philosophical provided foundation for calculus initially the work was not well due the many gaps arguments and complicated only after the translation into latin and the addition commentary van schooten and further work did masterpiece receive due pierre fermat also pioneered the development analytic although not published his manuscript form locos planos solidos isagoge introduction plane and solid was circulating paris just prior the publication discourse clearly written and well the introduction also laid the groundwork for analytical the key difference between and treatments matter fermat always started with algebraic equation and then described the geometric curve which satisfied while descartes starts with geometric curves and produces their equations one several properties the consequence this descartes had deal with more complicated equations and had develop the methods work with polynomial equations higher basic principles coordinates coordinate systems analytic the plane given coordinate which every point has pair real number coordinates the most common coordinate system use the cartesian coordinate system where each point has coordinate representing its horizontal and coordinate representing its vertical these are typically written ordered pair this system can also used for dimensional where every point euclidean space represented ordered triple coordinates other coordinate systems are the plane the most common alternative polar coordinates where every point represented its radius from the origin and its angle three common alternative coordinate systems include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates equations curves analytic any equation involving the coordinates specifies subset the namely the solution set for the for the equation corresponds the set all the points the plane whose coordinate and coordinate are these points form line and said the equation for this linear equations involving and specify quadratic equations specify conic sections and more complicated equations describe more complicated usually single equation corresponds curve the this not always the the trivial equation specifies the entire and the equation specifies only the single point three single equation usually gives surface and curve must specified the intersection two surfaces see system parametric equations the equation the equation for any circle with radius distance and angle analytic geometric notions such distance and angle measure are defined using formulas these definitions are designed consistent with the underlying euclidean geometry for using cartesian coordinates the the distance between two points and defined the formula which can viewed version the pythagorean theorem similarly the angle that line makes with the horizontal can defined the formula where the slope the transformations transformations are applied parent functions turn into new function with similar for the parent function has horizontal and vertical and occupies the first and third and all its transformed forms have one horizontal and vertical and occupies either the and and then can transformed into the new transformed the factor that vertically stretches the function greater than vertically compresses the function less than and for negative values the function reflected the the value compresses the graph the function horizontally greater than and stretches the function horizontally less than and like reflects the function the axis when the and values introduce vertical and horizontal positive and values mean the function translated the positive end its axis and negative meaning translation towards the negative transformations can applied any geometric equation whether not the equation represents transformations can considered individual transactions suppose that relation the plane for example the relation that describes the unit the graph changed standard transformations changing moves the graph the right units changing moves the graph units changing stretches the graph horizontally factor think the being changing stretches the graph changing and changing rotates the graph angle there are other standard transformation not typically studied elementary analytic geometry because the transformations change the shape objects ways not usually skewing example transformation not usually for more consult the wikipedia article affine transformations intersections while this discussion limited the can easily extended higher for two geometric objects and represented the relations and the intersection the collection all points which are both for might the circle with radius and center and might the circle with radius and center the intersection these two circles the collection points which make both equations does the point make both equations using for the equation for becomes which the relation the other still using for the equation for becomes which not not the the intersection and can found solving the simultaneous traditional methods include substitution and substitution solve the first equation for terms and then substitute the expression for into the second then substitute this value for into the other and proceed solve for next place this value either the original equations and solve for that our intersection has two elimination add multiple one equation the other equation that one the variables for our current subtract the first equation from the second the the first equation subtracted from the the second equation leaving term the variable has been then solve the remaining equation for the same way the substitution next place this value either the original equations and solve for that our intersection has two for conic many points might the intercepts one type intersection which widely studied the intersection geometric object with the and coordinate the intersection geometric object and the axis called the intercept the the intersection geometric object and the axis called the intercept the for the line the parameter specifies the point where the line crosses the axis depending the either the point called the themes important themes analytical geometry are vector space definition the plane distance problems the dot product get the angle two vectors the cross product get perpendicular vector two known vectors and also their spatial intersection problems conic sections depending the this may include rotation coordinates and the general quadratic problems the term rotations are generally many these problems involve linear algebra example here example problem from the united states america mathematical talent search that can solved via analytic problem convex pentagon the sides have lengths and though not necessarily that let and the midpoints the sides and respectively let the midpoint segment and the midpoint segment the length segment find all possible values for the length side solution without loss generality let and located and using the midpoint formula the points and are located using the distance formula and since has integer see modular arithmetic modern analytic geometry algebraic geometry complex geometry analytic variety defined locally the set common solutions several equations involving analytic functions analogous the included concept real complex algebraic variety any complex manifold analytic since analytic varieties may have singular points not all analytic varieties are modern analytic geometry essentially equivalent real and complex algebraic geometry has been shown jean pierre serre his paper gaga the name which french for algebraic geometry and analytic geometry nevertheless the two fields remain the methods proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry finite
