mathematics	areas mathematics navigation search mathematics has become vastly diverse subject over history and there corresponding need categorize the different areas mathematics number different classification schemes have and though they share some there are differences due part the different purposes they mathematics these classification schemes must evolve well account for newly created areas newly discovered links between different classification made more difficult some often the most which straddle the boundary between different traditional division mathematics into pure mathematics mathematics studied for its intrinsic and applied mathematics mathematics which can directly applied real world this division not always clear and many subjects have been developed pure mathematics find unexpected applications later broad such discrete mathematics and computational mathematics have emerged more contents classification systems major divisions mathematics foundations arithmetics algebra analysis combinatorics geometry and topology applied mathematics probability and statistics computational sciences physical sciences other mathematical sciences see also notes external links classification systems the mathematics subject classification produced the staff the review databases mathematical reviews and zentralblatt math many mathematics journals ask authors label their papers with msc subject the msc divides mathematics into over areas with further subdivisions within each the library congress classification mathematics assigned the subclass within the class the lcc defines broad divisions and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical the dewey decimal classification assigns mathematics division with subdivisions for algebra number theory arithmetic topology analysis geometry numerical analysis and probabilities applied mathematics the categories within mathematics list used the arxiv for categorising preprints more modern than msc and includes things like quantum algebra the imu uses its programme structure for organizing the lectures its yearly icm one its level sections that msc have lie theory the acm computing classification
