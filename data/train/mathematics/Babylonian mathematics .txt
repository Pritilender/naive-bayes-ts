from the days the early sumerians the fall babylon babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well respect time they fall two distinct one from the old babylonian period the other mainly seleucid from the last three four centuries respect content there scarcely any difference between the two groups thus babylonian mathematics remained character and for nearly two contrast the scarcity sources

written cuneiform script study has historically focused the old babylonian period the early second millennium due the wealth data there has been debate over the earliest appearance babylonian with historians suggesting range dates between the and millennia citation needed babylonian mathematics was primarily written clay tablets cuneiform script the akkadian sumerian languages babylonian perhaps unhelpful term since the earliest suggested origins date the use accounting such bullae and tokens the millennium citation needed babylonian numerals babylonian numerals the babylonian system mathematics was sexagesimal base numeral system from this derive the modern day usage seconds minutes and degrees citation needed the babylonians were able make great advances mathematics for two firstly the number superior highly composite number having factors including those that are themselves facilitating calculations with fractions additionally unlike the egyptians and the babylonians had true place value system where digits written the left column represented larger values much our base ten the sumerians and babylonians were pioneers this sumerian mathematics the ancient sumerians mesopotamia developed complex system metrology from from the sumerians wrote multiplication tables clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems the earliest traces the babylonian numerals also date back this old babylonian mathematics most clay tablets that describe babylonian mathematics belong the old babylonian which why the mathematics mesopotamia commonly known babylonian some clay tablets contain mathematical lists and others contain problems and worked arithmetic the babylonians used calculated tables assist with arithmetic for two tablets found senkerah the euphrates dating from give lists the squares numbers and the cubes numbers the babylonians used the lists squares together with the formulae simplify the babylonians did not have algorithm for long division instead they based their method the fact that together with table reciprocals numbers whose only prime factors are known smooth regular numbers have finite reciprocals sexagesimal and tables with extensive lists these reciprocals have been reciprocals such etc not have finite representations sexagesimal compute divide number the babylonians would use approximation such algebra well arithmetical babylonian mathematicians also developed algebraic methods solving equations once these were based calculated solve quadratic equation the babylonians essentially used the standard quadratic formula they considered quadratic equations the form where here and were not necessarily but was always they knew that solution this form equation citation needed and they would use their tables squares reverse find square they always used the positive root because this made sense when solving real problems problems this type included finding the dimensions rectangle given its area and the amount which the length exceeds the tables values were used solve certain cubic equations for consider the equation multiplying the equation and dividing gives substituting gives which could now solved looking the table find the value closest the right hand the babylonians accomplished this without algebraic showing remarkable depth however they did not have method for solving the general cubic growth babylonians modeled exponential constrained growth via form sigmoid functions and doubling time the latter the context interest clay tablets from bce include the exercise given interest rate per month compute the doubling this yields annual interest rate and hence doubling time growth growth per year years plimpton the plimpton tablet contains list pythagorean triples integers such that the triples are too many and too large have been obtained brute much has been written the including some speculation perhaps whether the tablet could have served early trigonometrical care must exercised see the tablet terms methods familiar accessible scribes the the question how was the tablet does not have have the same answer the question what problems does the tablet the first can answered most satisfactorily reciprocal first suggested half century and the second some sort triangle robson neither sherlock holmes nor reassessment plimpton historia geometry babylonians knew the common rules for measuring volumes and they measured the circumference circle three times the diameter and the area twelfth the square the which would correct estimated the volume cylinder was taken the product the base and the however the volume the frustum cone square pyramid was incorrectly taken the product the height and half the sum the the pythagorean theorem was also known the also there was recent discovery which tablet used and the babylonians are also known for the babylonian which was measure distance equal about seven miles kilometers today this measurement for distances eventually was converted mile used for measuring the travel the therefore representing the ancient babylonians had known theorems the ratios the sides similar triangles for many but they lacked the concept angle measure and studied the sides triangles the babylonian astronomers kept detailed records the rising and setting stars the motion the planets and the solar and lunar eclipses all which required familiarity with angular distances measured the celestial sphere they also used form fourier analysis compute ephemeris tables astronomical which was discovered the otto neugebauer influence since the rediscovery the babylonian has become apparent that greek and hellenistic mathematicians and astronomers and particular hipparchus borrowed greatly from the babylonians franz xaver kugler demonstrated his book die babylonische mondrechnung the babylonian lunar computation freiburg the ptolemy had stated his almagest that hipparchus improved the values for the periods known him from even more ancient comparing eclipse observations made earlier the and however kugler found that the periods that ptolemy attributes hipparchus had already been used babylonian ephemerides specifically the collection texts nowadays called system sometimes attributed kidinnu apparently hipparchus only confirmed the validity the periods learned from the chaldeans his newer clear that hipparchus and ptolemy after had essentially complete list eclipse observations covering many most likely these had been compiled from the diary tablets these are clay tablets recording all relevant observations that the chaldeans routinely preserved examples date from but probably the records went back far the reign the babylonian king nabonassar ptolemy starts his chronology with the first day the egyptian calendar the first year february this raw material itself must have been hard and doubt the chaldeans themselves compiled extracts all observed eclipses some tablets with list all eclipses period time covering saros have been this allowed them recognise periodic recurrences among others they used system almagest synodic months returns anomaly anomalistic month returns latitude draconic month this now known the saros period which useful for predicting eclipses months returns anomaly months returns latitude synodic month days days decimals days hours min real time seconds the babylonians expressed all periods synodic months probably because they used lunisolar calendar various relations with yearly phenomena led different values for the length the similarly various relations between the periods the planets were the relations that ptolemy attributes hipparchus almagest had all already been used predictions found babylonian clay all this knowledge was transferred the greeks probably shortly after the conquest alexander the great according the late classical philosopher simplicius early century alexander ordered the translation the historical astronomical records under supervision his chronicler callisthenes olynthus who sent his uncle aristotle although simplicius very late his account may spent some time exile the sassanid court and may have accessed sources otherwise lost the striking that mentions the title resis guard which odd name for historical but adequate translation the babylonian title massartu meaning guarding but also observing anyway aristotle pupil callippus cyzicus introduced his year which improved the year metonic cycle about that had the first year his first cycle start the summer solstice june proleptic julian calendar date but later seems have counted lunar months from the first month after decisive battle gaugamela fall callippus may have obtained his data from babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated also known that the babylonian priest known berossus wrote around book greek the rather history the babyloniaca for the new ruler antiochus said that later founded school astrology the greek island kos another candidate for teaching the greeks about babylonian astronomy astrology was sudines who was the court attalus soter late the century any the translation the astronomical records required profound knowledge the cuneiform script the and the seems likely that was done some unidentified now the babylonians dated their observations their lunisolar which months and years have varying lengths days months the time they did not use regular calendar such based the metonic cycle like they did but started new month based observations the new moon this made very tedious compute the time interval between what hipparchus may have done transform these records the egyptian calendar which uses fixed year always days consisting months days and extra this makes computing time intervals much ptolemy dated all observations this also writes that all that did was make compilation the planetary observations arranged more useful almagest pliny states naturalis historia eclipse after their time thales the courses both stars sun and for years were prophesied this seems imply that hipparchus predicted eclipses for period years but considering the enormous amount computation this very rather hipparchus would have made list all eclipses from time his other traces babylonian practice work first known greek use the division the circle degrees arc minutes first
