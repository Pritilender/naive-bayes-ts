binary relation relation navigation search finitary relation theory relations mathematics mathematics binary relation set collection ordered pairs elements other subset the cartesian product more binary relation between two sets and subset the terms correspondence dyadic relation and place relation are synonyms for binary example the divides relation between the set prime numbers and the set integers which every prime associated with every integer that multiple and not with any integer that not multiple this for the prime associated with numbers that include but not and the prime associated with numbers that include and but not binary relations are used many branches mathematics model concepts like greater than equal and divides arithmetic congruent geometry adjacent graph theory orthogonal linear algebra and many the concept function defined special kind binary binary relations are also heavily used computer science binary relation the special case ary relation that set tuples where the component each tuple taken from the domain the some systems axiomatic set theory relations are extended classes which are generalizations this extension needed among other modeling the concepts element subset set theory without running into logical inconsistencies such russell paradox contents formal definition relation more than its example special types binary relations relations over set operations binary relations complement restriction sets versus classes the number binary relations examples common binary relations see also notes references external links formal definition binary relation usually defined ordered triple where and are arbitrary sets and subset the cartesian product the sets and are called the domain the set and codomain the set respectively the and called its graph the statement read related and denoted xry the latter notation corresponds viewing the characteristic function for the set pairs the order the elements each pair then arb and bra can true independently each resuming the above the prime divides the integer but doesn divide relation defined the triple sometimes referred correspondence instead this case the relation from the subset and from must always either specified implied the context when referring the practice correspondence and relation tend used relation more than its according the definition two relations with identical graphs but different domains different codomains are considered for then and are three distinct especially set theory binary relations are often defined sets ordered identifying binary relations with their the domain binary relation then defined the set all such that there exists least one such that the range defined the set all such that there exists least one such that and the field the union its domain and its special case this difference points view applies the notion function many authors insist distinguishing between codomain and its range thus single like mapping every real number can lead distinct functions and depending whether the images under that rule are understood reals more non negative but others view functions simply sets ordered pairs with unique first this difference perspectives does raise some nontrivial the former camp considers surjectivity being property while the latter sees relationship that functions may bear either approach adequate for most provided that one attends the necessary changes notation and the definitions concepts like restrictions composition inverse relation and the choice between the two definitions usually matters only very formal like category theory example example suppose there are four objects car doll gun and four persons mary ian venus suppose that john owns the mary owns the and venus owns the nobody owns the gun and ian owns then the binary relation owned given thus the first element the set the second the set and the last element set ordered pairs the form owner the pair john denoted means that the ball owned two different relations could have the same for the relation different from the previous one everyone but the graphs the two relations are the nevertheless usually identified even defined and ordered pair usually denoted special types binary relations red green some important types binary relations between and are listed uniqueness injective also called left unique for all and and holds that xry and zry then for the green relation the picture but the red relation relates both and functional also called univalent right unique right definite citation needed for all and and holds that xry and xrz then such binary relation called partial function both relations the picture are example for functional relation can obtained rotating the red graph clockwise degrees considering the relation which relates both and one one also written injective and the green relation but the red totality left total for all there exists such that xry multivalued function this although sometimes also referred total different from the definition total the next both relations the picture are the relation obtained from the above not any real number surjective also called right total onto for all there exists such that xry the green relation but the red relation relate any real number uniqueness and totality function relation that functional and both the green and the red relation are bijection surjective one surjective injective function said bijective also known one one correspondence the green relation but the red relations over set then simply say that the binary relation over that endorelation over some types endorelations are widely studied graph theory where they are known simple directed graphs permitting loops the set all binary relations rel set the set which boolean algebra augmented with the involution mapping relation its inverse relation for the theoretical explanation see relation algebra some important properties binary relation over set are reflexive for all holds that xrx for greater than equal reflexive relation but greater irreflexive strict for all holds that not xrx for irreflexive but coreflexive for all and holds that xry then equal and example coreflexive symmetric for all and holds that xry then yrx blood relative symmetric because blood relative and only blood relative antisymmetric for all and xry and yrx then for symmetric but only because the condition the definition always asymmetric for all and xry then not yrx relation asymmetric and only both symmetric and for but transitive for all and holds that xry and yrz then xrz transitive relation irreflexive and only for ancestor while parent total for all and holds that xry yrx this definition for total different from left total the previous section for total trichotomous for all and exactly one xry yrx holds for trichotomous while the relation divides natural numbers euclidean for all and holds that xry and xrz then yrz and zry equality euclidean relation because and then serial for all there exists such that xry greater than serial relation the but not serial relation the positive because there the positive integers the natural such that however less than serial relation the positive the rational numbers and the real every reflexive relation for given choose set like for every the class all such that yrx this makes sense only relations proper classes are the usual ordering the class ordinal numbers while its inverse relation that symmetric and transitive called equivalence relation relation that antisymmetric and transitive called partial order partial order that total called total order simple order linear order linear order where every nonempty subset has least element called well order relation that transitive and serial also operations binary relations are binary relations over and then each the following binary relation over and union defined for the union and intersection defined and binary relation over and and binary relation over and then the following binary relation over and see main article composition relations composition also denoted more ambiguously clarification needed defined there exists such that and the order and the notation used here agrees with the standard notational order for composition functions for the composition mother parent yields maternal grandparent while the composition parent mother yields grandmother relation sets and said contained relation and subset that always implies this and disagree also said smaller than for contained binary relation over and then the following binary relation over and inverse converse defined binary relation over set equal its inverse and only see also duality order for less the inverse greater binary relation over then each the following binary relation over reflexive closure defined the smallest reflexive relation over containing this can proven equal the intersection all reflexive relations containing reflexive reduction defined the largest irreflexive relation over contained transitive closure defined the smallest transitive relation over containing this can seen equal the intersection all transitive relations containing transitive reduction defined clarification needed minimal relation having the same transitive closure reflexive transitive closure defined the smallest preorder containing reflexive transitive symmetric closure defined the smallest equivalence relation over containing complement binary relation over and then the following the complement defined not for real the complement the complement the inverse the inverse the the complement has the following relation the complement the complement reflexive relation irreflexive and vice the complement strict weak order total preorder and vice the complement the inverse has these same restriction the restriction binary relation set subset the set all pairs the relation for which and are relation reflexive irreflexive symmetric antisymmetric asymmetric transitive total trichotomous partial order total order strict weak order total preorder weak equivalence relation its restrictions are however the transitive closure restriction subset the restriction the transitive general not for restricting the relation parent females yields the relation mother the woman its transitive closure relate woman with her paternal the other the transitive closure parent ancestor its restriction females does relate woman with her paternal also the various concepts completeness not confused with being total not carry over for the set real numbers property the relation that every non empty subset with upper bound has least upper bound also called however for set rational numbers this supremum not necessarily the same property does not hold the restriction the relation the set rational the left restriction right restriction respectively binary relation between and subset its domain the set all pairs the relation for which element sets versus classes certain mathematical relations such equal member and subset cannot understood binary relations defined because their domains and codomains cannot taken sets the usual systems axiomatic set theory for try model the general concept equality binary relation must take the domain and codomain the class all which not set the usual set most mathematical references the relations membership and subset are harmless because they can understood implicitly restricted some set the the usual around this problem select large set that contains all the objects and work with the restriction instead similarly the subset relation needs restricted have domain and codomain the power set specific set the resulting set relation can denoted also the member relation needs restricted have domain and codomain obtain binary relation that bertrand russell has shown that assuming defined all sets leads contradiction naive set another solution this problem use set theory with proper such nbg morse kelley set theory and allow the domain and codomain and the proper classes such equality membership and subset are binary relations without special minor modification needs made the concept the ordered triple normally proper class cannot member ordered course one can identify the function with its graph this with this definition one can for instance define function relation between every set and its power the number binary relations the number distinct binary relations element set sequence oeis transitive reflexive preorder partial order total preorder total order equivalence relation oeis notes the number irreflexive relations the same that reflexive the number strict partial orders irreflexive transitive the same that partial the number strict weak orders the same that total the total orders are the partial orders that are also total the number preorders that are neither partial order nor total preorder therefore the number minus the number partial minus the number total plus the number total and respectively the number equivalence relations the number partitions which the bell number the binary relations can grouped into pairs complement except that for the relation its own the symmetric ones can grouped into quadruples complement inverse inverse examples common binary relations order relations including strict orders
