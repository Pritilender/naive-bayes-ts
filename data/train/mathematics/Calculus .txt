integral surface integral volume integral jacobian specialized fractional malliavin stochastic variations calculus the mathematical study the same way that geometry the study shape and algebra the study operations and their application solving has two major differential calculus concerning rates change and slopes and integral calculus concerning accumulation quantities and the areas under and between these two branches are related each other the fundamental theorem calculus both branches make use the fundamental notions convergence infinite sequences and infinite series defined limit generally considered have been founded the century isaac newton and gottfried leibniz today calculus has widespread uses science engineering and economics and can solve many problems that algebra alone calculus part modern mathematics education course calculus gateway more advanced courses mathematics devoted the study functions and broadly called mathematical analysis calculus has historically been called the calculus infinitesimals infinitesimal the word calculus comes from latin calculus and refers small stone used for more calculus plural calculi refers any method system

modern calculus was developed century europe isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz but elements have appeared ancient china medieval india and the middle ancient the ancient period introduced some the ideas that led integral calculus but does not seem have developed these ideas rigorous and systematic calculations volume and one goal integral can found the egyptian moscow papyrus but the formulas are simple with indication and some them lack major from the age greek mathematics eudoxus used the method exhaustion which foreshadows the concept the calculate areas and while archimedes developed this idea further inventing heuristics which resemble the methods integral the method exhaustion was later reinvented china liu hui the century order find the area the century chongzhi established method that would later called cavalieri principle find the volume sphere medieval alexander the great invasion northern india brought greek using the chord india where the cosine and tangent were indian mathematicians gave rigorous method differentiation some trigonometric the middle alhazen derived formula for the sum fourth powers used the results carry out what would now called integration where the formulas for the sums integral squares and fourth powers allowed him calculate the volume paraboloid the indian mathematician madhava sangamagrama and the kerala school astronomy and mathematics stated components calculus such the taylor series and infinite series approximations however they were not able combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes the derivative and the integral show the connection between the and turn calculus into the great solving tool have modern john von neumann the foundational work was treatise due bonaventura cavalieri who argued that volumes and areas should computed the sums the volumes and areas infinitesimally thin the ideas were similar the method but this treatise was lost until the early part the twentieth cavalieri work was not well respected since his methods could lead erroneous and the infinitesimal quantities introduced were disreputable the formal study calculus brought together infinitesimals with the calculus finite differences developed europe around the same pierre fermat claiming that borrowed from diophantus introduced the concept adequality which represented equality infinitesimal error the combination was achieved john wallis isaac barrow and james gregory the latter two proving the second fundamental theorem calculus around isaac newton laws motion gravitation the product rule and chain rule the notion higher derivatives taylor series and analytical functions were introduced isaac newton idiosyncratic notation which used solve problems mathematical physics his newton rephrased his ideas suit the mathematical idiom the replacing calculations with infinitesimals equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond used the methods calculus solve the problem planetary the shape the surface rotating the oblateness the the motion weight sliding cycloid and many other problems discussed his principia mathematica other developed series expansions for including fractional and irrational and was clear that understood the principles the taylor series did not publish all these and this time infinitesimal methods were still considered gottfried wilhelm leibniz these ideas were arranged into true calculus infinitesimals gottfried wilhelm leibniz who was originally accused plagiarism now regarded independent inventor and contributor his contribution was provide clear set rules for working with infinitesimal allowing the computation second and higher and providing the product rule and chain rule their differential and integral unlike leibniz paid lot attention the often spending days determining appropriate symbols for leibniz and newton are usually both credited with the invention newton was the first apply calculus general physics and leibniz developed much the notation used calculus the basic insights that both newton and leibniz provided were the laws differentiation and second and higher and the notion approximating polynomial the fundamental theorem calculus was when newton and leibniz first published their there was great controversy over which mathematician and therefore which deserved newton derived his results first later published his method fluxions but leibniz published his nova methodus pro maximis minimis first newton claimed leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished which newton had shared with few members the royal society this controversy divided speaking mathematicians from continental mathematicians for many the detriment english careful examination the papers leibniz and newton shows that they arrived their results with leibniz starting first with integration and newton with today both newton and leibniz are given credit for developing calculus however who gave the new discipline its newton called his calculus the science fluxions since the time leibniz and many mathematicians have contributed the continuing development one the first and most complete works finite and infinitesimal analysis was written maria gaetana agnesi maria gaetana agnesi foundations foundations refers the rigorous development subject from precise axioms and early calculus the use infinitesimal quantities was thought and was fiercely criticized number most notably michel rolle and bishop berkeley berkeley famously described infinitesimals the ghosts departed quantities his book the analyst working out rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much the century following newton and and still some extent active area research several including maclaurin tried prove the soundness using but would not until years later due the work cauchy and weierstrass way was finally found avoid mere notions infinitely small the foundations differential and integral calculus had been writing see cours analyse find broad range foundational including definition continuity terms and somewhat prototype definition limit the definition his work weierstrass formalized the concept limit and eliminated following the work eventually became common base calculus limits instead infinitesimal though the subject still occasionally called infinitesimal bernhard riemann used these ideas give precise definition the was also during this period that the ideas calculus were generalized euclidean space and the complex plane modern the foundations calculus are included the field real analysis which contains full definitions and proofs the theorems the reach calculus has also been greatly henri lebesgue invented measure theory and used define integrals all but the most pathological laurent schwartz introduced distributions which can used take the derivative any function limits are not the only rigorous approach the foundation another way use abraham robinson non standard analysis robinson developed the uses technical machinery from mathematical logic augment the real number system with infinitesimal and infinite numbers the original leibniz the resulting numbers are called hyperreal numbers and they can used give like development the usual rules significance while many the ideas calculus had been developed earlier egypt greece china india iraq persia and japan the use calculus began europe during the when isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz built the work earlier mathematicians introduce its basic the development calculus was built earlier concepts instantaneous motion and area underneath applications differential calculus include computations involving velocity and acceleration the slope and optimization applications integral calculus include computations involving area volume arc length center mass work and pressure more advanced applications include power series and fourier series calculus also used gain more precise understanding the nature time and for mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving division zero sums infinitely many these questions arise the study motion and area the ancient greek philosopher zeno elea gave several famous examples such paradoxes calculus provides especially the limit and the infinite series which resolve the principles limits and infinitesimals limit function infinitesimal calculus usually developed working with very small historically the first method doing was infinitesimals these are objects which can treated like numbers but which some infinitely infinitesimal number could greater than but less than any number the sequence and less than any positive real number any integer multiple infinitesimal still infinitely infinitesimals not satisfy the archimedean property from this point calculus collection techniques for manipulating this approach fell out favor the century because was difficult make the notion infinitesimal however the concept was revived the century with the introduction non standard analysis and smooth infinitesimal analysis which provided solid foundations for the manipulation the infinitesimals were replaced the epsilon delta approach limits limits describe the value function certain input terms its values nearby they capture scale behavior the context the real number system this calculus collection techniques for manipulating certain infinitesimals get replaced very small and the infinitely small behavior the function found taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller limits are the easiest way provide rigorous foundations for and for this reason they are the standard differential calculus differential calculus differential calculus the study the properties and applications the derivative the process finding the derivative called differentiation given function and point the the derivative that point way encoding the scale behavior the function near that finding the derivative function every point its possible produce new called the derivative function just the derivative the original mathematical the derivative linear operator which inputs function and outputs second this more abstract than many the processes studied elementary where functions usually input number and output another for the doubling function given the input then outputs and the squaring function given the input then outputs the however can take the squaring function this means that the derivative takes all the information the squaring such that two sent three sent four sent and and uses this information produce another the function produces turns out the doubling the most common symbol for derivative like mark called prime thus the derivative the function pronounced for the squaring then its the doubling the input the function represents then the derivative represents change with respect for function that takes time input and gives the position ball that time then the derivative how the position changing that the velocity the function linear that the graph the function straight then the function can written where the independent the dependent the and this gives exact value for the slope straight the graph the function not straight however then the change divided the change varies derivatives give exact meaning the notion change output with respect change let and fix point the domain point the graph the number close then number close therefore close the slope between these two points this expression called difference quotient line through two points curve called secant line the slope the secant line between and the secant line only approximation the behavior the function the point because does not account for what happens between and not possible discover the behavior setting zero because this would require dividing which the derivative defined taking the limit tends meaning that considers the behavior for all small values and extracts consistent value for the case when equals geometrically the derivative the slope the tangent line the graph the tangent line limit secant lines just the derivative limit difference for this the derivative sometimes called the slope the function here particular the derivative the squaring function the input let the squaring the slope tangent line the squaring function the point that going six times fast going the the limit process just described can performed for any point the domain the squaring this defines the derivative function the squaring just the derivative the squaring function for similar computation the one above shows that the derivative the squaring function the doubling leibniz notation leibniz notation common introduced for the derivative the example above approach based the symbol interpreted not the quotient two numbers but shorthand for the limit computed leibniz however did intend represent the quotient two infinitesimally small being the infinitesimally small change caused infinitesimally small change applied can also think differentiation which takes function input and gives another the the for this the the denominator read with respect even when calculus developed using limits rather than common manipulate symbols like and they were real although possible avoid such they are sometimes notationally convenient expressing operations such the total derivative integral calculus integral integral calculus the study the properties and applications two related the indefinite integral and the definite integral the process finding the value integral called integration technical integral calculus studies two related linear operators the indefinite integral the antiderivative the inverse operation the indefinite integral when derivative this use and case letters for function and its indefinite integral common the definite integral inputs function and outputs which gives the algebraic sum areas between the graph the input and the axis the technical definition the definite integral the limit sum areas called riemann sum motivating example the distances traveled given the speed only multiplication but the speed more powerful method finding the distance one such method approximate the distance traveled breaking the time into many short intervals then multiplying the time elapsed each interval one the speeds that and then taking the sum riemann sum the approximate distance traveled each the basic idea that only short time then the speed will stay more less the however riemann sum only gives approximation the distance must take the limit all such riemann sums find the exact distance when velocity the total distance traveled over the given time interval can computed multiplying velocity and for travelling steady mph for hours results total distance miles the diagram the when constant velocity and time are these two values form rectangle with height equal the velocity and width equal the time therefore the product velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the velocity this connection between the area under curve and distance traveled can extended any irregularly shaped region exhibiting fluctuating velocity over given time the diagram the right represents speed varies over the distance traveled between the times represented and the area the shaded approximate that intuitive method would divide the distance between and into number equal the length each segment represented the symbol for each small can choose one value the function call that value then the area the rectangle with base and height gives the distance time multiplied speed traveled that associated with each segment the average value the function above the sum all such rectangles gives approximation the area between the axis and the which approximation the total distance smaller value for will give more rectangles and most cases better but for exact answer need take limit approaches the symbol integration elongated the stands for sum the definite integral written and read the integral from with respect the leibniz notation intended suggest dividing the area under the curve into infinite number that their width becomes the infinitesimally small formulation the calculus based the notation understood operator that takes function input and gives the the terminating not and not being multiplied although serving reminder the limit can treated such symbolic manipulations the formally the differential indicates the variable over which the function integrated and serves closing bracket for the integration the indefinite functions differing only constant have the same and can shown that the antiderivative given function actually family functions differing only since the derivative the function where any the antiderivative the latter given the unspecified constant present the indefinite integral antiderivative known the constant integration fundamental theorem fundamental theorem calculus the fundamental theorem calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse more relates the values antiderivatives definite because usually easier compute antiderivative than apply the definition definite the fundamental theorem calculus provides practical way computing definite can also interpreted precise statement the fact that differentiation the inverse the fundamental theorem calculus function continuous the interval and function whose derivative the interval then for every the interval this made both newton and leibniz who based their results earlier work isaac barrow was key the massive proliferation analytic results after their work became the fundamental theorem provides algebraic method computing many definite without performing limit finding formulas for antiderivatives

gravity varieties over the many reformulations calculus have been investigated for different non standard calculus non standard calculus imprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced
