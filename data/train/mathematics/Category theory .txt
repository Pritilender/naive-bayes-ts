introducing more precise november category theory used formalize mathematics and its concepts collection objects and arrows also called morphisms category theory can used formalize concepts other level abstractions such set theory ring theory and group theory several terms used category including the term morphism differ from their uses within mathematics category morphism obeys set conditions specific category theory thus care must taken understand the context which statements are contents abstraction other mathematical concepts utility categories objects and morphisms functors natural transformations categories objects and morphisms categories morphisms functors natural transformations other concepts universal limits and colimits equivalent categories further concepts and results higher dimensional categories historical notes see also notes references external links abstraction other mathematical concepts many significant areas mathematics can formalised category theory categories category theory abstraction mathematics itself that allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results these fields and much simpler way than without the use the most accessible example category the category sets where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set however the objects category need not and the arrows need not any way formalising mathematical concept such that meets the basic conditions the behaviour objects and arrows valid and all the results category theory will apply the arrows category theory are often said represent process connecting two many cases transformation connecting two there are however many applications where much more abstract concepts are represented objects and the most important property the arrows that they can composed other arranged sequence form new categories now appear most branches some areas theoretical computer science where they can correspond types and mathematical physics where they can used describe vector spaces categories were first introduced samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane connection with algebraic topology category theory has several faces known not just but other term dating from the general abstract nonsense refers its high level compared more classical branches homological algebra category theory its aspect organising and suggesting manipulations abstract algebra utility categories objects and morphisms the study categories attempt axiomatically capture what commonly found various classes related mathematical structures relating them the structure preserving functions between systematic study category theory then allows prove general results about any these types mathematical structures from the axioms consider the following the class grp groups consists all objects having group one can proceed prove theorems about groups making logical deductions from the set for immediately proven from the axioms that the identity element group instead focusing merely the individual objects groups possessing given category theory emphasizes the morphisms the preserving mappings between these studying these are able learn more about the structure the the case the morphisms are the group homomorphisms group homomorphism between two groups preserves the group precise sense process taking one group way that carries along information about the structure the first group into the second the study group homomorphisms then provides tool for studying general properties groups and consequences the group similar type investigation occurs many mathematical such the study continuous maps between topological spaces topology the associated category called top and the study smooth functions manifold theory not all categories arise structure preserving functions however the standard example the category homotopies between pointed topological one axiomatizes relations instead functions one obtains the theory allegories functors functor adjoint functors motivation category itself type mathematical can look for processes which preserve this structure some such process called functor diagram chasing visual method arguing with abstract arrows joined functors are represented arrows between subject specific defining commutativity functors can define categorical diagrams and sequences mitchell functor associates every object one category object another and every morphism the first category morphism the what have done define category categories and functors the objects are and the morphisms between are studying categories and are not just studying class mathematical structures and the morphisms between are studying the relationships between various classes mathematical structures this fundamental which first surfaced algebraic topology difficult topological questions can translated into algebraic questions which are often easier basic such the fundamental group fundamental groupoid topological space can expressed fundamental functors the category groupoids this and the concept pervasive algebra and its natural transformations natural transformation abstracting yet some diagrammatic sequential constructions are often naturally vague first this leads the clarifying concept natural transformation way map one functor many important constructions mathematics can studied this naturality like general covariance that cuts deeper than initially arrow between two functors natural transformation when subject certain naturality commutativity functors and natural transformations are the key concepts category categories objects and morphisms category morphism categories category consists the following three mathematical class whose elements are called objects class whose elements are called morphisms maps arrows each morphism has source object and target object the expression would verbally stated morphism from the expression hom alternatively expressed hom mor denotes the hom class all morphisms from binary operation called composition morphisms such that for any three objects and have hom hom hom the composition and written governed two associativity and then and identity for every object there exists morphism called the identity morphism for such that for every morphism have identity morphism morphisms relations among morphisms such are often depicted using commutative diagrams with points representing objects and arrows representing morphisms can have any the following morphism monomorphism monic implies for all morphisms epimorphism epic implies for all morphisms bimorphism both epic and isomorphism there exists morphism such that and endomorphism end denotes the class endomorphisms automorphism both endomorphism and aut denotes the class automorphisms retraction right inverse exists there exists morphism with section left inverse exists there exists morphism with every retraction and every section furthermore the following three statements are monomorphism and epimorphism and functors functor functors are preserving maps between they can thought morphisms the category all categories covariant functor from category category written consists for each object object and for each morphism morphism such that the following two properties for every object for all morphisms and contravariant functor like covariant except that turns morphisms reverses all the more every morphism must assigned morphism other contravariant functor acts covariant functor from the opposite category natural transformations natural transformation natural transformation relation between two functors often describe natural and natural transformations then describe natural between two such sometimes two quite different constructions yield the result this expressed natural isomorphism between the two and are functors between the categories and then natural transformation from associates every object morphism such that for every morphism have this means that the following diagram commutative the two functors and are called naturally isomorphic there exists natural transformation from such that isomorphism for every object other concepts universal limits and colimits universal property limit category using the language category many areas mathematical study can categories include groups topologies and each category distinguished properties that all its objects have such the empty set the product two topologies yet the definition objects are considered not know whether object any other abstract hence the challenge define special objects without referring the internal structure those define the empty set without referring the product topology without referring open one can characterize these objects terms their relations other given the morphisms the respective thus the task find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects indeed turns out that numerous important constructions can described purely categorical the central concept which needed for this purpose called categorical limit and can dualized yield the notion colimit equivalent categories equivalence categories isomorphism categories natural question under which conditions can two categories considered essentially the the sense that theorems about one category can readily transformed into theorems about the other the major tool one employs describe such situation called equivalence categories which given appropriate functors between two categorical equivalence has found numerous applications further concepts and results the definitions categories and functors provide only the very basics categorical additional important topics are listed although there are strong interrelations between all these the given order can considered guideline for further the functor category has objects the functors from and morphisms the natural transformations such the yoneda lemma one the most famous basic results category describes representable functors functor duality every theorem definition category theory has dual which essentially obtained reversing all the one statement true category then its dual will true the dual category this which transparent the level category often obscured applications and can lead surprising adjoint functors functor can left adjoint another functor that maps the opposite such pair adjoint functors typically arises from construction defined universal this can seen more abstract and powerful view universal higher dimensional categories many the above especially equivalence adjoint functor and functor can situated into the context higher dimensional categories briefly consider morphism between two objects process taking from one object then dimensional categories allow profitably generalize this considering dimensional for category category together with morphisms between processes which allow transform one morphism into can then compose these bimorphisms both horizontally and and require dimensional exchange relating the two composition this the standard example cat the category all categories and this bimorphisms morphisms are simply natural transformations morphisms the usual another basic example consider category with single these are essentially monoidal categories bicategories are weaker notion dimensional categories which the composition morphisms not strictly but only associative this process can extended for all natural numbers and these are called categories there even notion category corresponding the ordinal number higher dimensional categories are part the broader mathematical field higher dimensional algebra concept introduced ronald brown for conversational introduction these see john tale historical notes samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane introduced functors and natural transformations part their work especially algebraic topology their work was important part the transition from intuitive and geometric homology axiomatic homology theory eilenberg and mac lane later wrote that their goal was understand natural order functors had which required stanislaw ulam and some writing his have claimed that related ideas were current the late eilenberg was and studied mathematics poland the category theory some continuation the work emmy noether one mac formalizing abstract noether realized that order understand type mathematical one needs understand the processes preserving that order achieve this eilenberg and mac lane proposed axiomatic formalization the relation between structures and the processes preserving the subsequent development category theory was powered first the computational needs homological algebra and later the axiomatic needs algebraic geometry the field most resistant being grounded either axiomatic set theory the russell whitehead view united general category extension universal algebra having many new features allowing for semantic flexibility and higher order logic came now applied throughout certain categories called topoi singular topos can even serve alternative axiomatic set theory foundation topos can also considered specific type category with two additional topos these foundational applications category theory have been worked out fair detail basis and justification constructive mathematics topos theory form abstract sheaf theory with geometric and leads ideas such pointless topology categorical logic now defined field based type theory for intuitionistic logics with applications functional programming and domain theory where cartesian closed category taken syntactic description lambda calculus the very category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have common some abstract sense category theory has been applied other fields for john baez has shown link between feynman diagrams physics and monoidal another application category more topos has been made mathematical music see for example the book the topos geometric logic concepts theory and performance guerino
