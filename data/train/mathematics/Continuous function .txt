small changes the input result small changes the otherwise function said discontinuous function continuous function with continuous inverse function called homeomorphism continuity functions one the core concepts topology which treated full generality the introductory portion this article focuses the special case where the inputs and outputs functions are real numbers this article discusses the definition for the more general case functions between two metric spaces order theory especially domain theory one considers notion continuity known scott continuity other forms continuity exist but they are not discussed this consider the function which describes the height growing flower time this function denotes the amount money bank account time then the function jumps whenever money

neighborhood definition sequences and nets closure operator definition properties homeomorphisms defining topologies via continuous functions related notions see also notes references history form this epsilon delta definition continuity was first given bernard bolzano augustin louis cauchy defined continuity infinitely small increment the independent variable always produces infinitely small change the dependent variable see cours analyse cauchy defined infinitely small quantities terms variable and his definition continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today see microcontinuity the formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given bolzano the but the work published until the eduard heine provided the first published definition uniform continuity but based these ideas lectures given peter gustav lejeune dirichlet real valued continuous functions definition function from the set real numbers the real numbers can represented graph the cartesian plane such function continuous roughly the graph single unbroken curve with holes jumps there are several ways make this intuition mathematically these definitions are equivalent one the most convenient definition can used determine whether given function continuous the definitions function defined subset the set real this subset referred the domain some possible choices include the whole set real open interval closed interval and are real definition terms limits functions the function continuous some point its domain the limit approaches through the domain exists and equal mathematical this written detail this means three first has defined second the limit the left hand side that equation has third the value this limit must equal the function said continuous continuous every point its the point the domain not limit point the then this condition vacuously true since cannot approach through values not equal thus for every function whose domain the set all integers definition terms limits sequences one can instead require that for any sequence points the domain which converges the corresponding sequence converges mathematical weierstrass definition continuous functions explicitly including the definition the limit obtain contained given function above and element the domain said continuous the point the following for any number however there exists some number such that for all the domain with the value satisfies alternatively continuity means that for there exists such that for all more can say that want get all the values stay some small neighborhood around simply need choose small enough neighborhood for the values around and can that matter how small the neighborhood then continuous modern this generalized the definition continuity function with respect basis for the topology here the metric topology definition using oscillation oscillation continuity can also defined terms oscillation function continuous point and only its oscillation that point benefit this definition that quantifies discontinuity the oscillation gives how much the function discontinuous this definition useful descriptive set theory study the set discontinuities and continuous points the continuous points are the intersection the sets where the oscillation less than hence set and gives very quick proof one direction the lebesgue integrability condition the oscillation equivalent the definition simple and using limit lim sup lim inf define given for given there that satisfies the definition then the oscillation least and conversely for every there desired the oscillation the oscillation definition can naturally generalized maps from topological space metric definition using the hyperreals cauchy defined continuity function the following intuitive infinitesimal change the independent variable corresponds infinitesimal change the dependent variable see cours analyse page non standard analysis way making this mathematically the real line augmented the addition infinite and infinitesimal numbers form the hyperreal numbers nonstandard continuity can defined see microcontinuity other infinitesimal increment the independent variable always produces infinitesimal change the dependent giving modern expression augustin louis cauchy definition examples cubic function all polynomial functions such pictured are this consequence the fact given two continuous functions defined the same domain then the sum and the product the two functions are continuous the same domain moreover the function the points where zero have discarded for for the function rational function asymptotes defined for all real numbers and continuous every such the question continuity does not since not the domain there continuous function that agrees with for all the sinc function defined for all continuous these however this function can extended continuous function all real namely since the limit when approaches therefore the point called removable singularity given two continuous functions the composition non examples example discontinuous function the function defined pick for instance there neighborhood around that will force all the values within intuitively can think this type discontinuity sudden jump function similarly the signum sign function discontinuous but continuous everywhere yet another the function continuous everywhere apart from thomae function continuous all irrational numbers and discontinuous all rational similar dirichlet function nowhere properties intermediate value theorem the intermediate value theorem existence theorem based the real number property completeness and closed interval for child grows from between the ages two and six then some time between two and six years the height must have been continuous and and differ sign then some point must equal zero extreme value theorem the extreme value theorem states that function defined closed interval any closed and bounded and continuous then the function attains its there exists with for all the same true the minimum these statements are true the function defined open interval any set that not both closed and for the continuous function defined the open interval does not attain being unbounded relation differentiability and integrability every differentiable function can the converse does not for the absolute value function everywhere however not differentiable but everywhere weierstrass function everywhere continuous but nowhere the derivative differentiable function need not said continuously the set such functions denoted more the set functions from open interval open subset the such that times differentiable and such that the derivative continuous denoted see differentiability class the field computer these three levels are sometimes called continuity continuity and continuity every continuous function integrable for example the sense the riemann integral the converse does not the but sign function shows pointwise and uniform limits given sequence functions such that the limit exists for all the resulting function referred the pointwise limit the sequence functions the pointwise limit function need not even all functions are the animation the right however continuous when the sequence converges uniformly the uniform convergence theorem this theorem can used show that the exponential functions logarithms square root function trigonometric functions are directional and continuity continuous function continuous function discontinuous functions may discontinuous restricted giving rise the concept directional continuity right and left continuous and semi continuity roughly function right continuous jump occurs when the limit point approached from the more said continuous the point the following for any number however there exists some number such that for all the domain with the value will satisfy this the same condition for continuous except that required hold for strictly larger than only requiring instead for all with yields the notion left continuous functions function continuous and only both continuous and function lower continuous roughly any jumps that might occur only but not that for any there exists some number such that for all the domain with the value satisfies the reverse condition upper continuity continuous functions between metric spaces the concept continuous valued functions can generalized functions between metric spaces metric space set equipped with function called metric that can thought measurement the distance any two elements formally the metric function that satisfies number notably the triangle inequality given two metric spaces and and function then continuous the point with respect the given for any positive real number there exists positive real number such that all satisfying will also satisfy the case real functions this equivalent the condition that for every sequence with limit lim have lim the latter condition can weakened continuous the point and only for every convergent sequence with limit the sequence cauchy sequence and the domain the set points which function between metric spaces continuous set this follows from the definition this notion continuity for functional analysis key statement this area says that linear operator between normed vector spaces and which are vector spaces equipped with compatible norm denoted continuous and only bounded that there constant such that for all uniform lder and lipschitz continuity the concept continuity for functions between metric spaces can strengthened various ways limiting the way depends and the definition intuitively function above uniformly continuous the does not depend the point more required that for every real number there exists such that for every with have that thus any uniformly continuous function the converse does not hold but holds when the domain space compact uniformly continuous maps can defined the more general situation uniform spaces function lder continuous with exponent real there constant such that for all and the inequality any lder continuous function uniformly the particular case referred lipschitz continuity that function lipschitz continuous there constant such that the inequality holds any the lipschitz condition for the picard theorem concerning the solutions ordinary differential equations continuous functions between topological spaces another more notion continuity continuity functions between topological spaces which there generally formal notion there the case metric spaces topological space set together with topology which set subsets satisfying few requirements with respect their unions and intersections that generalize the properties the open balls metric spaces while still allowing talk about the neighbourhoods given the elements topology are called open subsets with respect the function between two topological spaces and continuous for every open set the inverse image open subset that function between the sets and not the elements the topology but the continuity depends the topologies used and this equivalent the condition that the preimages the closed sets which are the complements the open are closed extreme set given the discrete topology which every subset all functions any topological space are the other equipped with the indiscrete topology which the only open subsets are the empty set and and the space set least then the only continuous functions are the constant conversely any function whose range indiscrete alternative definitions several equivalent definitions for topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways define continuous neighborhood definition neighborhoods allow define continuity for functions between topological spaces function continuous point iff for any neighborhood its image the preimage again neighborhood that according the property that neighborhood systems being upper sets this can restated the second one being restatement involving the image rather than the this means matter how small the neighborhood chosen one can always find neighborhood mapped into besides there simplification involving only open they the second one again being restatement using images rather than and are metric equivalent consider the neighborhood system open balls centered and instead all this gives back the above definition continuity the context metric however general topological there notion nearness note however that the target space hausdorff still true that continuous and only the limit approaches isolated every function sequences and nets several the topology space conveniently specified terms limit points many this accomplished specifying when point the limit sequence but for some spaces that are too large some one specifies also when point the limit more general sets points indexed directed set known nets function continuous only takes limits sequences limits the former preservation limits also the function may preserve all limits sequences yet still fail and preservation nets necessary and sufficient function sequentially continuous whenever sequence converges limit the sequence converges thus sequentially continuous functions preserve sequential every continuous function sequentially first countable space and countable choice holds then the converse also any function preserving sequential limits metric sequential continuity and continuity are for non countable sequential continuity might strictly weaker than the spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces this motivates the consideration nets instead sequences general topological continuous functions preserve limits and fact this property characterizes continuous closure operator definition instead specifying the open subsets topological the topology can also determined closure operator denoted which assigns any subset its closure interior operator denoted which assigns any subset its interior these function between topological spaces continuous the sense above and only for all subsets that given any element that the closure any subset belongs the closure this equivalent the requirement that for all subsets moreover continuous and only for any subset properties and are then the composition continuous and compact then connected then path connected then lindel then separable then the possible topologies fixed set are partially ordered topology said coarser than another topology every open subset with respect also open with respect then the identity map continuous and only see also comparison topologies more continuous function stays continuous the topology replaced coarser topology and replaced finer topology homeomorphisms symmetric the concept continuous map open map for which images open sets are open map has inverse function that inverse and continuous map has that inverse given bijective function between two topological the inverse function need not bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function called homeomorphism continuous bijection has its domain compact space and its codomain hausdorff then defining topologies via continuous functions given function where topological space and set without specified the final topology defined letting the open sets those subsets for which open has existing continuous with respect this topology and only the existing topology coarser than the final topology thus the final topology can characterized the finest topology that makes continuous surjective this topology canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined dually for function from set topological the initial topology has open subsets those subsets for which open has existing continuous with respect this topology and only the existing topology finer than the initial topology thus the initial topology can characterized the coarsest topology that makes continuous this topology canonically identified with the subspace topology viewed subset more given set specifying the set continuous functions into all topological spaces defines dually similar idea can applied maps this instance universal property related notions various other mathematical domains use the concept continuity but related for order theory preserving function between two complete lattices and particular types partially ordered sets continuous for each subset have here sup the supremum with respect the orderings and respectively applying this the complete lattice consisting the open subsets topological this gives back the notion continuity for maps between topological category theory functor between two categories called continuous commutes with small limits that for any small indexed set opposed class diagram objects continuity space generalization metric spaces and which uses the concept quantales and that can used unify the notions metric spaces and domains see also absolute continuity classification discontinuities coarse function continuous stochastic process dini continuity discrete function equicontinuity normal function
