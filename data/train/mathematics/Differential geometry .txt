notion covariant derivative tensor many concepts and techniques analysis and differential equations have been generalized the setting riemannian preserving diffeomorphism between riemannian manifolds called isometry this notion can also defined locally for small neighborhoods any two regular curves are locally however the theorema egregium carl friedrich gauss showed that already for the existence local isometry imposes strong compatibility conditions their the gaussian curvatures the corresponding points must the higher the riemann curvature tensor important pointwise invariant associated

diffeomorphism between two symplectic manifolds which preserves the symplectic form called symplectomorphism non degenerate symmetric bilinear forms can only exist dimensional vector symplectic manifolds necessarily have even dimension symplectic manifold just surface endowed with area form and symplectomorphism preserving the phase space mechanical system symplectic manifold and they made implicit appearance already the work joseph louis lagrange analytical mechanics and later carl gustav jacobi and william rowan hamilton formulations classical mechanics contrast with riemannian where the curvature provides local invariant riemannian darboux theorem states that all symplectic manifolds are locally the only invariants symplectic manifold are global nature and topological aspects play prominent role symplectic the first result symplectic topology probably the poincar birkhoff theorem conjectured henri and then proved birkhoff claims that area preserving map annulus twists each boundary component opposite then the map has least two fixed contact geometry contact geometry contact geometry deals with certain manifolds odd close symplectic geometry and like the originated questions classical contact structure dimensional manifold given smooth hyperplane field the tangent bundle that far possible from being associated with the level sets differentiable function the technical term completely nonintegrable tangent hyperplane near each point hyperplane distribution determined nowhere vanishing form which unique multiplication nowhere vanishing local form contact form the restriction its exterior derivative degenerate form and thus induces symplectic structure each the distribution can defined global form then this form contact and only the dimensional form volume form does not vanish contact analogue the darboux theorem all contact structures dimensional manifold are locally isomorphic and can brought certain local normal form suitable choice the coordinate complex and hler geometry complex differential geometry the study complex manifolds almost complex manifold real manifold endowed with tensor type vector bundle endomorphism called almost complex structure follows from this definition that almost complex manifold almost complex manifold called complex where tensor type related called the nijenhuis tensor sometimes the torsion almost complex manifold complex and only admits holomorphic coordinate atlas almost hermitian structure given almost complex structure along with riemannian metric satisfying the compatibility condition almost hermitian structure defines naturally differential form the following two conditions are where the levi civita connection this called hler structure and hler manifold manifold endowed with hler

geometry boundaries domains complex manifolds differential topology differential topology the study geometric invariants without metric symplectic starts from the natural operations such lie derivative natural vector bundles and rham differential forms beside lie algebroids also courant algebroids start playing more important lie groups lie group group the category smooth beside the algebraic properties this enjoys also differential geometric the most obvious construction that lie algebra which the tangent space the unit endowed with the lie bracket between invariant vector fields beside the structure theory there also the wide field representation theory bundles and connections the apparatus vector bundles principal bundles and connections bundles plays extraordinarily important role modern differential smooth manifold always carries natural vector the tangent bundle loosely this structure itself sufficient only for developing analysis the while doing geometry some way relate the tangent spaces different notion parallel transport important example provided affine connections for surface tangent planes different points can identified using natural wise parallelism induced the ambient euclidean which has known standard definition metric and riemannian geometry the levi civita connection serves similar the civita connection defines wise parallelism terms given arbitrary riemannian metric more differential geometers consider spaces with vector bundle and arbitrary affine connection which not defined terms the manifold may the space time continuum and the bundles and connections are related various physical intrinsic versus extrinsic from the beginning and through the middle the differential geometry was studied from the extrinsic point curves and surfaces were considered lying euclidean space higher dimension for example surface ambient space three the simplest results are those the differential geometry curves and differential geometry surfaces starting with the work riemann the intrinsic point view was which one cannot speak moving outside the geometric object because considered given standing the fundamental result here theorema egregium the effect that gaussian curvature intrinsic the intrinsic point view more for useful relativity where time cannot naturally taken extrinsic what would outside with the intrinsic point view harder define the central concept curvature and other structures such connections there price these two points view can the extrinsic geometry can considered structure additional the intrinsic see the
