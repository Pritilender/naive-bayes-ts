contrast real numbers that have the property varying smoothly the objects studied discrete mathematics such integers graphs and statements logic not vary smoothly this but have separated discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics continuous such calculus and analysis discrete objects can often enumerated more discrete mathematics has been characterized the branch mathematics dealing with countable sets sets that have the same cardinality subsets the natural including rational numbers but not real however there exact definition the term discrete indeed discrete mathematics described less what included than what continuously varying quantities and related the set objects studied discrete mathematics can finite the term finite mathematics sometimes applied parts the field discrete mathematics that deals with finite particularly those areas relevant research discrete mathematics increased the latter half the twentieth century partly due the development digital computers which

which discrete structures can combined enumerative combinatorics concentrates counting the number certain combinatorial objects the twelvefold way provides unified framework for counting permutations combinations and partitions analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration determining the combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions describe the analytic combinatorics aims obtaining asymptotic formulae design theory study combinatorial designs which are collections subsets with certain intersection properties partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related integer partitions and closely related series special
