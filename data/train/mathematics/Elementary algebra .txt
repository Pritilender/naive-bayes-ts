encompasses some the basic concepts algebra one the main branches mathematics typically taught secondary school students and builds their understanding arithmetic whereas arithmetic deals with specified algebra introduces quantities without fixed known this use variables entails use algebraic notation and understanding the general rules the operators introduced unlike abstract algebra elementary algebra not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm real and complex numbers the use variables denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities formally and concisely and thus enables solving broader scope most quantitative results science and mathematics are expressed algebraic equations contents algebraic notation alternative notation concepts variables evaluating expressions equations properties equality properties inequality substitution solving algebraic equations linear equations with one variable linear equations with two variables quadratic equations exponential and logarithmic equations radical equations system linear equations elimination method substitution method other types systems linear equations inconsistent systems undetermined systems over and underdetermined systems see also references external links algebraic notation mathematical notation algebraic notation describes how algebra follows certain rules and and has its own for the expression has the following exponent coefficient term operator constant variables coefficient numerical value which multiplies variable the operator term addend summand group variables constants and exponents that may separated from the other terms the plus and minus letters represent variables and letters the beginning the alphabet are typically used represent constants and those toward the end the alphabet and are used represent variables they are usually written algebraic operations work the same way arithmetic operations such addition subtraction multiplication division and exponentiation and are applied algebraic variables and multiplication symbols are usually and implied when there space between two variables when coefficient for written and may written usually terms with the highest power exponent are written the for written the left when coefficient usually omitted written likewise when the exponent written when the exponent the result always always rewritten however being should not appear and care should taken simplifying expressions which variables may appear alternative notation other types notation are used algebraic expressions when the required formatting not can not such where only letters and symbols are for exponents are usually formatted using plain text and the tex mark the caret symbol represents written programming languages such ada fortran perl python and ruby double asterisk written many programming languages and calculators use single asterisk represent the multiplication and must explicitly for written concepts variables circle circumference diameter variable elementary algebra builds and extends arithmetic introducing letters called variables represent general numbers this useful for several variables may represent numbers whose values are not yet known for the temperature degrees higher than the temperature then the problem can described algebraically variables allow one describe general problems without specifying the values the quantities that are for can stated specifically that minutes equivalent seconds more general description may state that the number where the number variables allow one describe mathematical relationships between quantities that may for the relationship between the and circle described variables allow one describe some mathematical for basic property addition commutativity which states that the order numbers being added together does not commutativity stated algebraically evaluating expressions expression algebraic expressions may evaluated and based the basic properties arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication division and exponentiation for added terms are simplified using for example can simplified where the multiplied terms are simplified using for example represented like terms are added for written because the terms containing are added and the terms containing are added brackets can multiplied using distributivity for can written which can written expressions can for dividing both terms can written equations pythagoras rule equation equation states that two expressions are equal using the symbol for the equals sign one the most known equations describes law relating the length the sides right angle triangle this equation states that representing the square the length the side that the hypotenuse the side opposite the right equal the sum the squares the other two sides whose lengths are represented and equation the claim that two expressions have the same value and are some equations are true for all values the involved variables such such equations are called identities conditional equations are true for only some values the involved true only for and the values the variables which make the equation true are the solutions the equation and can found through equation solving another type equation inequalities are used show that one side the equation than the the symbols used for this where represents greater and where represents less just like standard equality numbers can subtracted multiplied the only exception that when multiplying dividing negative the inequality symbol must properties equality equality equivalence relation meaning has the properties reflexive symmetric then transitive and then also satisfies the important property that two symbols are used for equal then one symbol can substituted for the other any true statement about the first and the statement will remain this implies the following and then and then more for any function implies properties inequality the relations less than and greater than have the property and then and then and then and then note that reversing the can swap and for equivalent substitution substitution substitution substitution replacing the terms expression create new substituting for the expression makes new expression with meaning substituting the terms statement makes new when the original statement true independent the values the the statement created substitutions also hence definitions can made symbolic terms and interpreted through where means defined substituting for informs the reader this statement that means often not known whether the statement true independent the values the and substitution allows one derive restrictions the possible show what conditions the statement holds for taking the statement substituted with this imples which which implies that then and integers rationals real numbers then implies suppose abc then substituting for and for learn then can substitute letting and show that then therefore abc then abc implies consider the original fact were stated implies then when say suppose abc have conflict terms when yet the above logic still valid show that abc then instead letting and substitute for and for and with substituting for and for this shows that substituting for the terms statement always the same letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted this situation clear that substitute expression into the term the original the substituted does not refer the the statement implies solving algebraic equations equation solving the following sections lay out examples some the types algebraic equations that may linear equations with one variable linear equation linear equations are because when they are they describe straight line hence linear the simplest equations solve are linear equations that have only one they contain only constant numbers and single variable without consider solve this kind the technique subtract multiply divide both sides the equation the same number order isolate the variable one side the once the variable the other side the equation the value the this problem and its solution are the general form linear equation with one can written following the same procedure subtract from both and then divide the general solution given linear equations with two variables linear equation with two variables has many infinite number solutions for this can not worked out told you then there would longer two unknowns and the problem becomes linear equation with just one that can solved described solve linear equation with two variables requires two related for also revealed now there are two related linear each with two which lets produce linear equation with just one subtracting one from the other called the elimination other son aged and years must years son will and will twice his this problem illustrated the associated plot the for other ways solve this kind see system linear equations quadratic equations quadratic equation quadratic equation one which includes term with exponent for and term with higher the name derives from the latin quadrus meaning quadratic equation can expressed the form where not zero were then the equation would not quadratic but because this quadratic equation must contain the term which known the quadratic hence and may divide and rearrange the equation into the standard form where and solving process known completing the square leads the quadratic formula where the symbol indicates that both are solutions the quadratic quadratic equations can also solved using factorization the reverse process which expansion but for two linear terms sometimes denoted foiling example which the same thing follows from the zero product property that either are the since precisely one the factors must equal zero all quadratic equations will have two solutions the complex number system but need not have any the real number system for has real number solution since real number squared equals sometimes quadratic equation has root multiplicity such for this root multiplicity this means appears two exponential and logarithmic equations logarithm graph axis coordinates log does not meet intersect exponential equation one which has the form for which has solution when elementary algebraic techniques are used rewrite given equation the above way before arriving the for subtracting from both sides the and then dividing both sides obtain whence logarithmic equation equation the form for which has solution for adding both sides the followed dividing both sides get whence from which obtain radical equations radical equation one that includes radical which includes square roots cube roots and roots recall that root can rewritten exponential that equivalent combined with regular exponents then the square root cubed can rewritten common form radical equation equivalent where and are integers has for then system linear equations system linear equations there are different methods solve system linear equations with two elimination method example solving system linear equations using the elimination multiplying the terms the second equation adding the two equations together which simplifies since the fact that then possible deduce that either the original two equations using instead the full solution this problem then note that this not the only way solve this specific could have been solved before substitution method another way solving the same system linear equations equivalent for can deduced using one the two using the second subtracting from each side the and multiplying using this value the first equation the original adding each side the which simplifies using this value one the the same solution the previous method note that this not the only way solve this specific this case could have been solved before other types systems linear equations inconsistent systems the above solution however there are also systems equations which not have any such system called inconsistent obvious example the second equation the system has therefore the system has however not all inconsistent systems are recognized first let consider the system multiplying both sides the second and adding the first one results which has clearly undetermined systems there are also systems which have infinitely many contrast system with unique solution unique pair values for and for isolating the second and using this value the first equation the the equality but does not provide value for indeed one can easily verify just filling some values that for any there solution long there infinite number solutions for this over and underdetermined systems systems with more variables than the number linear equations not have unique example such system such system called underdetermined when trying solve one led express some variables functions the other but cannot express all solutions numerically system with greater number equations than which necessarily some equations are linear combinations the others any solution called overdetermined see also history elementary algebra binary operation gaussian elimination mathematics education number
