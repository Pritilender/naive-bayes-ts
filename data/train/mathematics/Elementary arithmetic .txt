may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used wikipedia see guide writing better articles for march this article includes list references related reading external links but its sources remain unclear because lacks inline citations please improve this article introducing more precise may elementary arithmetic the simplified portion arithmetic that includes the operations addition subtraction multiplication and division should not confused with elementary function arithmetic elementary arithmetic starts with the natural numbers and the written symbols digits that represent the process for combining pair these numbers with the four basic operations traditionally relies memorized results for small values including the contents multiplication table assist with multiplication and elementary arithmetic also includes fractions and negative numbers which can represented number line the abacus early mechanical device for performing elementary which still used many parts modern calculating tools that perform elementary arithmetic operations include cash registers electronic calculators and computers contents the digits addition what does mean add two natural addition algorithm example successorship and size counting subtraction multiplication what does mean multiply two natural multiplication algorithm for digit factor example multiplication algorithm for digit factors example division division notation educational standards see also references further reading external links the digits numerical digit digits are the entire set symbols used represent particular numeral system single digit represents different amount than any other although the symbols the same numeral system might vary between modern the arabic numerals are the most common set and the most frequently used form these digits the western each single digit matches the following zero used the absence objects for different way saying there are sticks say the number sticks here one applied single for here one two applied pair here are two three applied three here are three four applied four here are four five applied five here are five six applied six here are six seven applied seven here are seven eight applied eight here are eight nine applied nine here are nine any numeral system defines the value all numbers that contain more than one most often addition the value for adjacent the hindu arabic numeral system includes positional notation determine the value for any this type the increase value for additional digit includes one more multiplications with the radix value and the result added the value adjacent with arabic the radix value ten produces value one equal for the numeral additional multiplication with the radix value occurs for each additional the numeral represents value one equal the elementary level study typically includes understanding the value individual whole numbers using arabic numerals with maximum seven and performing the four basic operations using arabic numerals with maximum four digits addition addition when two numbers are added the result called sum the two numbers being added together are called addends what does mean add two natural suppose you have two one bag holding five apples and second bag holding three grabbing empty move all the apples from the first and second bags into the third the third bag now holds eight this illustrates the combination three apples and five apples eight more three plus five three plus five equals eight the sum three and numbers are and the addition group three things group five things will yield group eight addition two sets objects that were counted separately are put into single group and counted the count the new group the sum the separate counts the two original this operation combining only one several possible meanings that the mathematical operation addition can other meanings for addition comparing tom has apples jane has more apples than how many apples does jane joining tom has apples jane gives him more how many apples does tom have measuring desk feet jane also feet how wide will their desks when put and even sometimes separating tom had some gave now has how many did start symbolically addition represented the plus sign the statement three plus five equals can written symbolically the order which two numbers are added does not this the commutative property add pair digits using the find the intersection the row the first digit with the column the second the row and the column intersect square containing the sum the two some pairs digits add digit with the digit always being the addition algorithm the digit the sum pair digits called the carry digit addition algorithm for consider only numbers with three digits add pair numbers written arabic write the second number under the first that digits line the rightmost column will contain the digit the second number under the digit the first this rightmost column the the column immediately its left the the column will have the digit the second number has under the digit the first number has the column immediately the left the column the the column will line the digit the second number there under the digit the first number there after the second number has been written down under the first one that digits line their correct draw line under the second number start with the the column should contain pair the digit the first number under the digit the second find the sum these two write this sum under the line and the the sum has two then write down only the digit the write the carry above the top digit the next this case the next column the write above the digit the first both first and second number each have only one digit then their sum given the addition and the addition algorithm then comes the the column might contain two the digit the first number and the digit the second one the numbers has missing digit then the digit for this number can considered add the digits the two then there carry add this the sum was then adding the carry digit will yield the sum the digits plus carry there less than ten then write the column under the the sum has two digits then write its last digit the column under the and carry its first digit which should over the next this case the none the two numbers has digit then there carry digit then the addition algorithm has there carry digit carried over from the then write the column under the and the algorithm when the algorithm the number under the line the sum the two least one the numbers has digit then one the numbers has missing digit then write digit its add the two and their sum add the carry digit there then write the sum the column under the also the hundreds the sum has two digits then write down the last digit the sum the column and write the carry digit its the example say one wants find the sum the numbers and write the second number under the first with digits aligned like then draw line under the second number and put plus the addition starts with the the digit the first number and the second number the sum three and four write the column under the next the the digit the first number and the digit the second number and five plus seven which has two write its last the column under the and write the carry digit the column above the first next the the digit the first number while the digit the second number the sum six and two but there carry which added eight equal write the under the line the digits and have been left the algorithm and successorship and size the result the addition one number the successor that examples the successor zero the successor one the successor two the successor ten every natural number has the predecessor the successor number the number for five the successor four therefore four the predecessor every natural number except zero has number the successor another then the first number said larger than the other number larger than another and the other number larger than third then the first number also larger than the third example five larger than and four larger than therefore five larger than but six larger than therefore six also larger than but seven larger than therefore seven also larger than therefore eight larger than therefore nine larger than etc two zero natural numbers are added then their sum larger than either one example three plus five equals therefore eight larger than three and eight larger than five the symbol for larger number larger than another then the other smaller than the first examples three smaller than eight and five smaller than eight the symbol for smaller than number cannot the same time larger and smaller than another neither can number the same time larger than and equal another given pair natural one and only one the following cases must the first number larger than the second the first number equal the second the first number smaller than the second counting count group objects means assign natural number each one the were label for that such that natural number never assigned object unless its predecessor was already assigned another with the exception that zero not assigned any the smallest natural number assigned and the largest natural number assigned depends the size the called the count and equal the number objects that the process counting group the let the equal the variable which though beginning with value will soon have its value changed several find least one object the group which has not been labeled with natural such object can found they have all been then the counting otherwise choose one the unlabeled increase the count that replace the value the count its assign the new value the the unlabeled object chosen step back step when the counting the last value the count will the final this count equal the number objects the often when counting one does not keep track what numerical label corresponds which one only keeps track the subgroup objects which have already been able identify unlabeled objects necessary for step however one counting then one can ask the persons who are being counted each keep track the number which the self has been after the count has finished possible ask the group persons file order increasing numerical what the persons would during the process lining would something like each pair persons who are unsure their positions the line ask each other what their numbers the person whose number smaller should stand the left side and the one with the larger number the right side the other thus pairs persons compare their numbers and their and commute their positions and through repetition such conditional commutations they become subtraction subtraction subtraction the mathematical operation which describes reduced the result this operation the difference between two the minuend and the subtrahend with subtraction can have number such separating tom has apples gives away apples how many does have comparing tom has apples jane has fewer apples than how many does jane combining tom has apples three the apples are green and the rest are how many are and sometimes joining tom had some jane gave him more now has apples how many did start with there are other possible such motion symbolically the minus sign represents the subtraction the statement five minus three equals also written elementary subtraction uses smaller positive numbers for all values produce simpler unlike subtraction not the order numbers the operation will change the therefore each number provided different distinguishing the first number the previous formally defined the minuend and the second number the previous the subtrahend the value the minuend larger than the value the subtrahend that the result positive but smaller value the minuend will result negative numbers there are several methods accomplish the method which the united states america referred traditional mathematics taught elementary school students subtract using methods suitable for hand the particular method used varies from country and within different methods are fashion different reform mathematics distinguished generally the lack preference for any specific replaced guiding grade students invent their own methods such using properties negative numbers the case terc american schools currently teach method subtraction using borrowing and system markings called although method borrowing had been known and published textbooks apparently the crutches are the invention william browell who used them study november this system caught displacing the other methods subtraction use america that students some european countries are and some older americans method subtraction called the austrian also known the additions there borrowing this there are also crutches markings aid the which vary according the method subtraction such will accomplish the place subtraction from borrowing from and adding the the problem thus transformed into effectively this indicated striking through the writing small above and writing small above the these markings are called crutches the then subtracted from leaving and the from the leaving the the additions borrowed make the into preparation for the subtraction just the borrowing however the not taken reducing the rather one augments the effectively the problem transformed into typically crutch small one marked just below the subtrahend digit then the operations from and that from the the additions method seem taught two which differ only continuing the example the first variation attempts subtract from and then from borrowing marking near the digit the subtrahend the next the second variation attempts find digit when added gives and recognizing that not gives and carrying the the one marking near the same digit the first the markings are the just matter preference how one explains its final the borrowing method gets bit complicated cases such where borrow cannot made and must obtained reaching across several this the minuend effectively rewritten taking from the making ten from and immediately borrowing that down nine the tens column and finally placing the ones multiplication multiplication when two numbers are multiplied the result called product the two numbers being multiplied together are called factors with multiplicand and multiplier also what does mean multiply two natural suppose there are five red each one containing three now grabbing empty green move all the apples from all five red bags into the green now the green bag will have fifteen thus the product five and three this can also stated five times three five times three equals fifteen the product five and multiplication can seen form repeated the first factor indicates how many times the second factor should added onto the final sum being the symbolically multiplication represented the multiplication sign the statement five times three equals can written symbolically some and more advanced other multiplication signs are some especially algebra where numbers can symbolized with the multiplication symbol may means the order which two numbers are multiplied does not for three times four equals four times this the commutative property multiply pair digits using the find the intersection the row the first digit with the column the second the row and the column intersect square containing the product the two most pairs digits produce digit the multiplication algorithm the digit the product pair digits called the carry digit multiplication algorithm for digit factor consider multiplication where one the factors has multiple whereas the other factor has only one write down the digit then write the digit factor under the last digit the digit draw horizontal line under the digit henceforth the digit factor will called the multiplicand and the digit factor will called the multiplier suppose for simplicity that the multiplicand has three the first digit the the middle digit the and the rightmost digit the the multiplier only has the digits the multiplicand and multiplier form the start with the the column should contain pair the digit the multiplicand under the digit the find the product these two write this product under the line and the the product has two then write down only the digit the write the carry superscript the unwritten digit the next column and under the this case the next column the write the carry digit the superscript the unwritten digit the product under the both first and second number each have only one digit then their product given the multiplication and the multiplication algorithm then comes the the column far contains only one the digit the multiplicand though might contain carry digit under the find the product the multiplier and the digits the then there carry digit under the line and the add this the resulting sum less than ten then write the column under the the sum has two digits then write its last digit the column under the and carry its first digit over the next this case the hundreds the multiplicand does not have digit then there carry digit then the multiplication algorithm has there carry digit carried over from the then write the column under the and the algorithm when the algorithm the number under the line the product the two the multiplicand has find the product the multiplier and the digit the and this product add the carry digit there then write the resulting sum the column under the also the hundreds the sum has two digits then write down the last digit the sum the column and write the carry digit its the example say one wants find the product the numbers and write the digit multiplier under the digit with the multiplier under the digit the like then draw line under the multiplier and put multiplication multiplication starts with the the digit the multiplicand and the multiplier the product and write the column under the and write the digit superscript the unwritten digit the product under the next the the digit the multiplicand the multiplier and three times two add the the obtain eight has only one write the column under the you can erase the two next the the digit the multiplicand while the multiplier the product and and there previous digit carried over from the the product has two write its last digit the column under the then carry its first digit over the since the multiplicand has then write this digit the column under the line not digits the multiplicand have been left the algorithm and multiplication algorithm for digit factors given pair each one having two more write both factors one under the other that digits line for simplicity consider pair digits write the last digit the second number under the last digit the first forming the immediately the left the column will the the top this column will have the second digit the first and below will the second digit the second immediately the left the column will the the top this column will have the first digit the first number and below will the first digit the second after having written down both draw line under the second the multiplication will consist two the first part will consist several multiplications involving digit the operation each one such multiplications was already described the previous multiplication this algorithm will not describe each one but will only describe how the several multiplications with digit multipliers shall the second part will add all the subproducts the first and the resulting sum will the first part let the first factor called the let each digit the second factor called let the digit the second factor called the let the digit the second factor called the let the digit the second factor called the start with the find the product the multiplier and the multiplicand and write down row under the aligning the digits the product the defined the product has four then the first digit will the beginning the let this product called the then the find the product the multiplier and the multiplicand and write down call the under the but shifted one column the left that the digit the row will the column the the digit the row will under the digit the the digit the row will under the digit the the row has four then the first digit will the beginning the next the find the product the multiplier and the multiplicand and write down call the under the but shifted one more column the that the digit the row will the the digit the row will the the digit the row will the the row has four then the first digit will the beginning the after having down the tens and draw horizontal line under the the multiplications are second part now the multiplication has pair the first one under the pair and the second one under the three rows under the second line there will six which from right left are the ones tens hundreds thousands ten and between the first and second the column will contain only one located the the digit the copy this digit rewriting the column under the second between the first and second the column will contain pair digits located the row and the the digit the row and the digit the add these digits and the sum has just one digit then write this digit the column under the second the sum has two digits then the first digit write the last digit down the column under the second line and carry the first digit over the writing superscript the unwritten digit under the second between the first and second the column will contain three the digit the the digit the and the digit the find the sum these three then there digit from the column written superscript under the second line the then add this digit the resulting sum has one digit then write down under the second line the has two digits then write the last digit down under the line the and carry the first digit over the writing superscript the unwritten digit under the between the first and second the column will contain either two three the digit the the digit the and the digit the find the sum these then there digit from the column written superscript under the second line the then add this digit the resulting sum has one digit then write down under the second line the has two digits then write the last digit down under the line the and carry the first digit over the writing superscript the unwritten digit under the between the first and second the column will contain either one two the digit the column and the digit the find the sum these digits the one the row missing think and there digit from the column written superscript under the second line the then add this digit the resulting sum has one digit then write down under the second line the has two digits then write the last digit down under the line the and carry the first digit over the writing superscript the unwritten thousands digit under the however the row has digit then not write this digit but normal the position the digit under the second and the multiplication algorithm the row does have then add the digit from the previous row there digit then think and write the digit sum the column under the second the number under the second line the after product the pair factors above the first example let our objective find the product and write the under the three and draw horizontal line under first part start with the the multiplicand and the multiplier perform the multiplication row under the then the the multiplicand and the multiplier perform the multiplication the under the previous subproduct the but shifted one column the next the the multiplicand once again and the multiplier perform the multiplication the under the previous subproduct the but shifted one column the then draw horizontal line under the second now add the subproducts between the first and second but ignoring any superscripted digits located between the first and second the answer division division mathematics especially elementary arithmetic division arithmetic operation which the inverse multiplication specifically times equals written where not zero then divided equals written for since the above called the dividend the divisor and the quotient division zero where the divisor not division notation division most often shown placing the dividend over the divisor with horizontal also called vinculum between for divided written this can read out loud divided over way express division all one line write the dividend then slash then the divisor like this the usual way specify division most computer programming languages since can easily typed simple sequence handwritten typographical which halfway between these two uses solidus fraction but elevates the and lowers the any these forms can used display fraction common fraction division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers although typically called the numerator and denominator and there implication that the division needs evaluated more basic way show division use the obelus division this this form infrequent except basic the obelus also used alone represent the division operation for label key calculator some english speaking divided written however english usage the colon restricted expressing the related concept ratios then with knowledge multiplication tables two integers can divided paper using the method long division the dividend has fractional part expressed decimal fraction one can continue the algorithm past the ones place far the divisor has decimal fractional one can restate the problem moving the decimal the right both numbers until the divisor has divide multiply the reciprocal reversing the position the top and bottom that educational standards local standards usually define the educational
