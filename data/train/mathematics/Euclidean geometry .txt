euclid which described his textbook geometry the elements euclid method consists assuming small set intuitively appealing axioms and deducing many other propositions theorems from although many results had been stated earlier euclid was the first show how these propositions could fit into comprehensive deductive and logical system the elements begins with plane still taught secondary school the first axiomatic system and the first examples formal proof goes the solid geometry three dimensions much the elements states results what are now called algebra and number theory explained geometrical for more than two thousand the adjective euclidean was unnecessary because other sort geometry had been euclid axioms seemed intuitively obvious with the possible exception the parallel postulate that any theorem proved from them was deemed true often sense today however many other self consistent non euclidean geometries are the first ones having been discovered the early implication albert einstein theory general relativity that physical space itself not and euclidean space good approximation for only where the gravitational field contents the elements axioms parallel postulate methods proof system measurement and arithmetic notation and terminology naming points and figures complementary and supplementary angles modern versions notation some important well known

apollonius descartes century century and euclidean geometry century and general relativity treatment infinity infinite objects infinite processes logical basis classical logic modern standards rigor axiomatic formulations constructive approaches and pedagogy see also classical theorems notes references external links the elements euclid elements the elements are mainly systematization earlier knowledge its superiority over earlier treatments was rapidly with the result that there was little interest preserving the earlier and they are now nearly all there are total books the elements books and discuss plane many results about plane figures are triangle has two equal then the sides subtended the angles are the pythagorean theorem books and deal with number with numbers treated geometrically via their representation line segments with various notions such prime numbers and rational and irrational numbers are the infinitude prime numbers books xiii concern solid typical result the ratio between the volume cone and cylinder with the same height and axioms euclidean geometry axiomatic system which all theorems true are derived from small number near the beginning the first book the elements euclid gives five postulates for plane stated terms constructions translated thomas let the following draw straight line from any point any produce finite straight line continuously straight describe circle with any centre and distance that all right angles are equal one the parallel postulate straight line falling two straight lines make the interior angles the same side less than two right the two straight produced meet that side which are the angles less than the two right although statement the postulates only explicitly asserts the existence the they are also taken the elements also include the following five common things that are equal the same thing are also equal one another transitive property equals are added then the wholes are equal addition property equals are subtracted from then the remainders are equal subtraction property things that coincide with one another are equal one another reflexive the whole greater than the parallel postulate parallel postulate the the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the they were concerned with creating system which was absolutely rigorous and them seemed the parallel line postulate should have been able proven rather than simply accepted now known that such proof euclid himself seems have considered being qualitatively different from the evidenced the organization the elements the first propositions presents are those that can proved without many alternative axioms can formulated that have the same logical consequences the parallel for example playfair axiom states plane methods proof euclidean geometry constructive postulates and assert the existence and uniqueness certain geometric and these assertions are constructive that are not only told that certain things but are also given methods for creating them with more than compass and unmarked straightedge this euclidean geometry more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such set theory which often assert the existence objects without saying how construct even assert the existence objects that cannot constructed within the strictly the lines paper are models the objects defined within the formal rather than instances those for example euclidean straight line has but any real drawn line though nearly all modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods just sound constructive euclid constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive some the proofs that involved irrational which usually required statement such find the greatest common measure euclid often used proof contradiction euclidean geometry also allows the method which figure transferred another point for proposition side side congruence proved moving one the two triangles that one its sides coincides with the other equal and then proving that the other sides coincide some modern treatments add sixth the rigidity the which can used alternative system measurement and arithmetic euclidean geometry has two fundamental types angle and the angle scale and euclid uses the right angle his basic degree angle would referred half right the distance scale one arbitrarily picks line segment with certain nonzero length the and other distances are expressed relation addition distances represented construction which one line segment copied onto the end another line segment extend its and similarly for measurements area and volume are derived from for rectangle with width and length has area that represents the because this geometrical interpretation multiplication was limited three there was direct way interpreting the product four more and euclid avoided such although they are the proof book proposition similar distance angles invariants euclid refers pair pair planar solid equal their areas volumes are and similarly for the stronger term congruent refers the idea that entire figure the same size and shape another alternatively two figures are congruent one can moved top the other that matches with flipping over thus for rectangle and rectangle are equal but not and the letter congruent its mirror figures that would congruent except for their differing sizes are referred corresponding angles pair similar shapes are congruent and corresponding sides are proportion each notation and terminology naming points and figures points are customarily named using capital letters the other such triangles are named listing sufficient number points pick them out unambiguously from the relevant triangle abc would typically triangle with vertices points and complementary and supplementary angles angles whose sum right angle are called complementary complementary angles are formed when one more rays share the same vertex and are pointed direction that between the two original rays that form the right the number rays between the two original rays are those whose sum straight angle are supplementary supplementary angles are formed when one more rays share the same vertex and are pointed direction that between the two original rays that form the straight angle degrees the number rays between the two original rays are infinite like those possible the complementary modern versions notation modern angles would normally measured degrees radians modern school textbooks often define separate figures called lines rays and line segments finite euclid rather than discussing ray object that extends infinity one would normally use locutions such the line extended sufficient although occasionally referred infinite line euclid could either straight and used the more specific term straight when some important well known results the pons asinorum bridge asses theorem states that isosceles and the triangle angle sum theorem states that the sum the three angles any this case angles and will always equal degrees the pythagorean theorem states that the sum the areas the two squares the legs and right triangle equals the area the square the hypotenuse thales theorem states that then the angle right pons asinorum the bridge asses pons asinorum states that isosceles triangles the angles the base equal one and the equal straight lines are produced then the angles under the base equal one its name may attributed its frequent role the first real test the elements the intelligence the reader and bridge the harder propositions that might also named because the geometrical resemblance steep bridge that only footed donkey could congruence triangles triangles are congruent they have all three sides equal two sides and the angle between them equal two angles and side equal only the first these three actually the other two are axioms they are assumed book propositions and triangles with three equal angles are but not necessarily also triangles with two equal sides and adjacent angle are not necessarily equal triangle angle sum the sum the angles triangle equal straight angle degrees this causes equilateral triangle have interior angles degrees also causes every triangle have least acute angles and obtuse right angle pythagorean theorem the celebrated pythagorean theorem book proposition states that any right the area the square whose side the hypotenuse the side opposite the right equal the sum the areas the squares whose sides are the two legs the two sides that meet right thales theorem thales theorem named after thales miletus states that and are points circle where the line diameter the then the angle abc right cantor supposed that thales proved his theorem means euclid book prop after the manner euclid book prop tradition has that thales sacrificed celebrate this scaling area and volume modern the area plane figure proportional the square any its linear and the volume solid the euclid proved these results various special cases such the area circle and the volume parallelepipedal euclid determined but not the relevant constants was his successor archimedes who proved that sphere has the volume the circumscribing applications this section requires expansion march because euclidean fundamental status would impossible give more than representative sampling applications surveyor uses level sphere packing applies stack oranges parabolic mirror brings parallel rays light suggested the etymology the one the earliest reasons for interest geometry was surveying and certain practical results from euclidean such the angle property the triangle were used long before they were proved the fundamental types measurements euclidean geometry are distances and and both these quantities can measured directly historically distances were often measured chains such gunter chain and angles using graduated circles later the theodolite application euclidean solid geometry the determination packing arrangements such the problem finding the most efficient packing spheres this problem has applications error detection and correction geometric optics uses euclidean geometry analyze the focusing light lenses and geometry used art and the water tower consists and its volume can calculated using solid geometry can used design geometry used extensively architecture geometry can used design origami some classical construction problems geometry are impossible using compass and straightedge but can solved using origami description the structure space euclid believed that his axioms were evident statements about physical euclid proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious fundamental particular that certain movements figures not change their geometrical properties such the lengths sides and interior the called euclidean motions which include translations and rotations taken physical description postulate extending asserts that space does not have holes boundaries other space homogeneous and unbounded postulate equality right says that space isotropic and figures may moved any location while maintaining congruence and postulate the parallel postulate that space flat has intrinsic curvature discussed more detail einstein theory relativity significantly modifies this the ambiguous character the axioms originally formulated euclid makes possible for different commentators disagree about some their other implications for the structure such whether not infinite see and what its topology modern more rigorous reformulations the system typically aim for cleaner separation these interpreting axioms the spirit this more modern axioms are consistent with either infinite finite space elliptic geometry and all five axioms are consistent with variety topologies torus for dimensional euclidean later work archimedes and apollonius archimedes bce bce colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are remembered along with euclid one the greatest ancient although the foundations his work were put place his unlike believed have been entirely proved equations for the volumes and areas various figures two and three and enunciated the archimedean property finite apollonius perga bce bce mainly known for his investigation conic frans hals descartes ren descartes developed analytic geometry alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused turning geometry into this point represented its cartesian coordinates line represented its and original the pythagorean theorem follows from the cartesian the axioms are the axioms and the equation expressing the pythagorean theorem then definition one the terms which are now considered the equation defining the distance between two points and then known the euclidean metric and other metrics define non euclidean geometries terms analytic the restriction classical geometry compass and straightedge constructions means restriction and order also the girard desargues motivated the theory perspective introduced the concept idealized lines and planes the result can considered type generalized projective geometry but can also used produce proofs ordinary euclidean geometry which the number special cases compass and straightedge century geometers the century struggled define the boundaries the euclidean many tried vain prove the fifth postulate from the first least different proofs had been but all were found leading this geometers also tried determine what constructions could accomplished euclidean for the problem trisecting angle with compass and straightedge one that naturally occurs within the since the axioms refer constructive operations that can carried out with those however centuries efforts failed find solution this until pierre wantzel published proof that such construction was other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and squaring the circle the case doubling the the impossibility the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve and order while doubling cube requires the solution order euler discussed generalization euclidean geometry called affine geometry which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four way that eliminates the notions angle whence right triangles become and equality length line segments general whence circles become while retaining the notions parallelism equivalence relation between and equality length parallel line segments line segments continue have century and euclidean geometry the early carnot and bius systematically developed the use signed angles and line segments way simplifying and unifying the most significant development geometry occurred around nos bolyai and nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky separately published work non euclidean geometry which the parallel postulate not since euclidean geometry provably relatively consistent with euclidean the parallel postulate cannot proved from the other the was also realized that ten axioms and common notions not suffice prove all theorems stated the elements for euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains least two but this assumption cannot proved from the other and therefore must axiom the very first geometric proof the elements shown the figure that any line segment part euclid constructs this the usual drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection the third vertex his however not guarantee that the circles actually because they not assert the geometrical property which cartesian terms equivalent the completeness property the real starting with moritz pasch many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been the best known being those hilbert george birkhoff and tarski century and general relativity eclipse theory general relativity shows that the true geometry spacetime not euclidean for triangle constructed out three rays then general the interior angles not add degrees due relatively weak gravitational such the the represented metric that but not euclidean until the there was technology capable detecting the deviations from euclidean but einstein predicted that such deviations would they were later verified observations such the slight bending starlight the sun during solar eclipse and such considerations are now integral part the software that runs the gps system possible object this interpretation general relativity the grounds that light rays might improper physical models that relativity could rephrased avoid the geometrical however one the consequences theory that there possible physical test that can distinguish between beam light model geometrical line and any other physical thus the only logical possibilities are accept euclidean geometry physically reject the entire notion physical tests the axioms which can then imagined formal system without any intrinsic world treatment infinity infinite objects euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between finite postulate and infinite lines book proposition however typically did not make such distinctions unless they were the postulates not explicitly refer infinite although for example some commentators interpret postulate existence circle with any implying that space the notion infinitesimal quantities had previously been discussed extensively the eleatic school but nobody had been able put them firm logical with paradoxes such zeno paradox occurring that had not been resolved universal euclid used the method exhaustion rather than later ancient commentators such proclus treated many questions about infinity issues demanding proof proclus claimed prove the infinite divisibility based proof contradiction which considered the cases even and odd numbers points constituting the turn the otto stolz paul reymond giuseppe veronese and others produced controversial work non archimedean models euclidean which the distance between two points may infinite the newton leibniz sense fifty years abraham robinson provided rigorous logical foundation for infinite processes one reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate less certain than the others that verifying physically would require inspect two lines check that they never even some very distant and this inspection could potentially take infinite amount the modern formulation proof induction was not developed until the but some later commentators consider implicit some the proof the infinitude supposed paradoxes involving infinite such zeno paradox predated euclid avoided such giving for the expression for the partial sums the geometric series without commenting the possibility letting the number terms become logical basis this article needs attention from expert mathematics please add reason talk parameter this template explain the issue with the wikiproject mathematics its portal may able help recruit december this section requires expansion june hilbert axioms axiomatic system real closed field classical logic euclid frequently used the method proof contradiction and therefore the traditional presentation euclidean geometry assumes classical logic which every proposition either true for any proposition the proposition not automatically modern standards rigor placing euclidean geometry solid axiomatic basis was preoccupation mathematicians for the role primitive notions undefined was clearly put forward alessandro padoa the peano delegation the paris when begin formulate the can imagine that the undefined symbols are completely devoid meaning and that the unproved propositions are simply conditions imposed upon the undefined then the system ideas that have initially chosen simply one interpretation the undefined but this interpretation can ignored the who free replace his mind another interpretation that satisfies the logical questions thus become completely independent empirical psychological questions abstraction specialized theories essai une orie brique des nombre avec une introduction logique une orie ductive qulelconque that mathematics independent knowledge within hierarchical said bertrand russell our hypothesis about anything and not about some one more particular then our deductions constitute thus mathematics may defined the subject which never know what are talking nor whether what are saying mathematics and the metaphysicians such foundational approaches range between foundationalism and formalism axiomatic formulations geometry the science correct reasoning incorrect how solve his dissertation trinity cambridge bertrand russell summarized the changing role geometry the minds philosophers that was conflict between certain independent and requiring experimental this issue became clear was discovered that the parallel postulate was not necessarily valid and its applicability was empirical deciding whether the applicable geometry was euclidean non euclidean hilbert axioms hilbert axioms had the goal identifying simple and complete set independent axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could the outstanding objectives were make euclidean geometry rigorous avoiding hidden and make clear the ramifications the parallel birkhoff axioms birkhoff proposed four postulates for euclidean geometry that can confirmed experimentally with scale and the notions angle and distance become primitive tarski axioms alfred tarski and his students defined elementary euclidean geometry the geometry that can expressed first order logic and does not depend set theory for its logical contrast which involve point tarski proved that his axiomatic formulation elementary euclidean geometry consistent and complete certain sense there algorithm for every can shown either true this violate theorem because euclidean geometry cannot describe sufficient amount arithmetic for the theorem this equivalent the decidability real closed fields which elementary euclidean geometry constructive approaches and pedagogy the process abstract axiomatization exemplified hilbert axioms reduces geometry theorem proving predicate logic the greeks used construction and emphasized problem for the constructions are more primitive than existence and can used prove existence but not vice versa describe problem solving adequately requires richer system logical the contrast approach may axiomatic proofs are deductive derivations propositions from primitive premises that are some the aim justify the analytic proofs are deductive derivations hypotheses from the aim find hypotheses capable giving solution the one can argue that axioms were arrived upon this thought that euclid felt the parallel postulate was forced upon indicated his reluctance make use and his arrival upon the method andrei nicholaevich kolmogorov proposed problem solving basis for this work was precursor modern formulation terms constructive type theory this development has
