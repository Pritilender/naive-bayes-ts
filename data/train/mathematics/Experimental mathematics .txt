mathematics	experimental mathematics navigation search experimental mathematics experimental mathematics approach mathematics which numerical computation used investigate mathematical objects and identify properties and has been defined that branch mathematics that concerns itself ultimately with the codification and transmission insights within the mathematical community through the use experimental either the baconian aristotelian kantian exploration conjectures and more informal beliefs and careful analysis the data acquired this contents history objectives and uses tools and techniques applications and examples plausible but false examples practitioners see also references external links history mathematicians have always practised experimental existing records early such babylonian mathematics typically consist lists numerical examples illustrating algebraic however modern beginning the developed tradition publishing results formal and abstract the numerical examples that may have led mathematician originally formulate general theorem were not and were generally experimental mathematics separate area study emerged the twentieth when the invention the electronic computer vastly increased the range feasible with speed and precision far greater than anything available previous generations significant milestone and achievement experimental mathematics was the discovery the bailey plouffe formula for the binary digits this formula was discovered not formal but instead numerical searches only afterwards was rigorous proof objectives and uses the objectives experimental mathematics are generate understanding and generate and confirm confront and generally make mathematics more lively and fun for both the professional researcher and the the uses experimental mathematics have been defined gaining insight and discovering new patterns and using graphical displays suggest underlying mathematical testing and especially falsifying exploring possible result see worth formal suggesting approaches for formal replacing lengthy hand derivations with based confirming analytically derived tools and techniques experimental mathematics makes use numerical methods calculate approximate values for integrals and infinite arbitrary precision arithmetic often used establish these values high degree precision typically significant figures integer relation algorithms are then used search for relations between these values and mathematical working with high precision values reduces the possibility mistaking mathematical coincidence for true formal proof conjectured relation will then sought often easier find formal proof once the form conjectured relation counterexample being sought scale proof exhaustion being distributed computing techniques may used divide the calculations between multiple frequent use made general computer algebra systems such mathematica although specific software also written for attacks problems that require high experimental mathematics software usually includes error detection and correction mechanisms integrity checks and redundant calculations designed minimise the possibility results being invalidated hardware software applications and examples applications and examples experimental mathematics searching for counterexample roger frye used experimental mathematics techniques find the smallest counterexample euler sum powers conjecture the zetagrid project was set search for counterexample the riemann hypothesis this project searching for counterexample the collatz conjecture finding new examples numbers objects with particular the great internet mersenne prime search searching for new mersenne primes the distributed net ogr project searching for optimal golomb rulers the riesel sieve project searching for the smallest riesel number the seventeen bust project searching for the smallest sierpinski number the sudoku project searching for solution the minimum sudoku finding serendipitous numerical edward lorenz found the lorenz attractor early example chaotic dynamical system investigating anomalous behaviours numerical weather the ulam spiral was discovered mitchell feigenbaum discovery the feigenbaum constant was based initially numerical followed rigorous use computer programs check large but finite number cases complete computer assisted proof exhaustion thomas hales proof the kepler conjecture various proofs the four colour theorem clement proof the existence finite projective plane order symbolic validation via computer algebra conjectures motivate the search for analytical solutions special case the quantum three body problem known the hydrogen ion were found standard quantum chemistry basis sets before realizing they all lead the same unique analytical solution terms generalization the lambert function related this work the isolation previously unknown link between gravity theory and quantum mechanics lower dimensions see quantum gravity and references the realm relativistic many bodied mechanics namely the time symmetric wheeler feynman absorber theory the equivalence between advanced wiechert potential particle acting particle and the corresponding potential for particle acting particle was demonstrated exhaustively order before being proved the feynman theory has regained interest because quantum nonlocality the realm linear verification the series expansion the envelope the electric field for ultrashort light pulses travelling non isotropic media previous expansions had been the outcome revealed extra term vindicated experiment evaluation infinite series infinite products and integrals also see symbolic integration typically carrying out high precision numerical and then using integer relation algorithm such the inverse symbolic calculator find linear combination mathematical constants that matches this for the following identity was first conjectured enrico student jonathan borwein using computer search and pslq algorithm visual indra pearls david mumford and others investigated various properties bius transformation and schottky group using computer generated images the groups furnished convincing evidence for many conjectures and lures further exploration plausible but false examples mathematical coincidence some plausible relations hold high degree but are still not one example the two sides this expression only differ after the decimal another example that the maximum height maximum absolute value all the factors appears the same the height the cyclotomic polynomial this was shown computer true for and was expected true for all however larger computer search showed that this equality fails hold for when the height the cyclotomic polynomial
