fermat last theorem navigation search theorem diophantus arithmetica observatio domini petri fermat number theory fermat last theorem sometimes called fermat conjecture especially older states that three positive integers and can satisfy the equation for any integer value greater than this theorem was first conjectured pierre fermat famously the margin copy arithmetica where claimed had proof that was too large fit the the first successful proof was released andrew wiles and formally published after years effort the unsolved problem stimulated the development algebraic number theory the century and the proof the modularity theorem the among the most famous theorems the history mathematics and prior its proof was the guinness book world records for most difficult mathematical contents overview the problem subsequent developments and solution mathematical history pythagoras and diophantus pythagorean triples diophantine equations fermat conjecture did fermat possess general proofs for specific exponents sophie germain ernst kummer and the theory ideals mordell conjecture computational studies connection with elliptic curves the weil conjecture frey equation ribet theorem wiles general proof subsequent developments exponents other than positive integers rational exponents negative exponents integer values other than positive integers monetary prizes see also footnotes references bibliography further reading external links overview the problem fermat last theorem known this title historically although technically conjecture unproven until proven stood unsolved riddle mathematics for over three the theorem itself deceptively simple statement that fermat famously stated had proved around his claim was discovered some years after his written the margin but with proof provided the claim eventually became one the most famous unsolved problems attempts prove prompted substantial development number theory and over time last theorem itself gained legendary prominence unsolved problem popular mathematics based the pythagorean theorem which states that where and are the lengths the legs right triangle and the length the hypotenuse the pythagorean equation has infinite number positive integer solutions for and these solutions are known pythagorean triplets fermat stated that the more general equation had solutions positive integers integer greater than although claimed have general proof his fermat left details his proof apart from the special case subsequent developments and solution with the special case proven the problem was prove the theorem for exponents that are prime numbers this limitation considered trivial prove note over the next two centuries the conjecture was proven for only the primes and although sophie germain innovated and proved approach that was relevant entire class the ernst kummer extended this and proved the theorem for all regular primes leaving irregular primes analyzed building work and using sophisticated computer other mathematicians were able extend the proof cover all prime exponents four but proof for all exponents was inaccessible meaning that mathematicians generally considered proof either best exceedingly not achievable with current the proof last theorem for all was finally however after years andrew wiles achievement for which was honoured and received numerous the solution came roundabout from completely different area around japanese mathematicians goro shimura and yutaka taniyama suspected link might exist between elliptic curves and modular forms two completely different areas known the time the weil and the modularity theorem stood its with apparent connection last was widely seen significant and important its own but was like widely considered completely inaccessible gerhard frey noticed apparent link between the modularity theorem and last this potential link was confirmed two years later ken ribet ribet theorem and frey curve hearing english mathematician andrew who had childhood fascination with last decided try prove the modularity theorem way prove last after six years working secretly the wiles succeeded proving enough the modularity theorem prove last wiles paper was massive size and flaw was discovered one part his original paper during peer review and required further year and collaboration with past richard taylor the final proof was accompanied smaller joint paper that wiles achievement was reported widely the popular and was popularized books and television the remaining parts the modularity theorem were subsequently proven other building work between and mathematical history pythagoras and diophantus pythagorean triples pythagorean triple pythagorean triple named for the ancient greek pythagoras set three integers that satisfy special case equation examples pythagorean triples include and there are infinitely many such and methods for generating such triples have been studied many beginning with the babylonians and later ancient greek chinese and indian mathematicians the traditional interest pythagorean triples connects with the pythagorean theorem its converse states that triangle with sides lengths and has right angle between the and legs when the numbers are pythagorean right angles have various practical such surveying carpentry masonry and construction fermat last theorem extension this problem higher stating that solution exists when the exponent replaced any larger diophantine equations diophantine equation with positive integer solutions example diophantine equation named for the century alexandrian mathematician diophantus who studied them and developed methods for the solution some kinds diophantine typical diophantine problem find two integers and such that their and the sum their equal two given numbers and respectively diophantus major work the arithmetica which only portion has fermat conjecture his last theorem was inspired while reading new edition the arithmetica that was translated into latin and published claude bachet diophantine equations have been studied for thousands for the solutions the quadratic diophantine equation are given the pythagorean triples originally solved the babylonians solutions linear diophantine such may found using the euclidean algorithm century many diophantine equations have form similar the equation last theorem from the point view that they have cross terms mixing two without sharing its particular for known that there are infinitely many positive integers and such that where and are relatively prime natural note fermat conjecture arithmetica diophantus problem the arithmetica asks how given square number split into two other other for given rational number find rational numbers and such that diophantus shows how solve this squares problem for the solutions being and around fermat wrote his last theorem the margin his copy the arithmetica next sum squares after death his son samuel fermat produced new edition the book augmented with his the margin note became known fermat last theorem was the last asserted theorems remain did fermat possess general not known whether fermat had actually found valid proof for all exponents but appears only one related proof him has namely for the case described the section proofs for specific exponents while fermat posed the cases and challenges his mathematical such marin mersenne blaise pascal and john wallis never posed the general moreover the last thirty years his fermat never again wrote his truly marvellous the general and never published van der poorten suggests that while the absence proof the lack challenges means fermat realised did not have quotes weil saying fermat must have briefly deluded himself with irretrievable the techniques fermat might have used such marvellous are taylor and proof relies century fermat proof would have had have been elementary given the mathematical knowledge his while harvey friedman grand conjecture implies that any provable theorem including last can proved using only elementary function arithmetic such proof need only technical sense but could involve millions and thus far too long have been proofs for specific exponents proof last theorem for specific exponents only one relevant proof fermat has which uses the technique infinite descent show that the area right triangle with integer sides can never equal the square his proof equivalent demonstrating that the equation has primitive solutions integers pairwise coprime solutions this proves last theorem for the case since the equation can written alternative proofs the case were developed later nicle bessy leonhard euler kausler peter barlow adrien marie legendre schopis terquem joseph bertrand victor lebesgue theophile pepin tafelmacher david hilbert bendz gambioli leopold kronecker bang sommer bottari karel nutzhorn robert carmichael hancock and nceanu for another proof for infinite see infinite non solvability for various proofs for infinite see grant and perella barbara and dolan after fermat proved the special case the general proof for all required only that the theorem established for all odd prime other was necessary prove only that the equation has integer solutions when odd prime number this follows because solution for given equivalent solution for all the factors for let factored into and the general equation implies that solution for the exponent prove that equation has solutions for suffices prove that has solutions for least one prime factor every all integers contain factor odd prime therefore fermat last theorem can proven for all can proven for and for all odd primes the only even prime number the number the two centuries following its conjecture fermat last theorem was proven for three odd prime exponents and the case was first stated abu mahmud khojandi but his attempted proof the theorem was leonhard euler gave proof but his proof infinite descent contained major however since euler himself had proven the lemma necessary complete the proof other generally credited with the first independent proofs were published kausler legendre calzolari gabriel peter guthrie tait nther gambioli krey rychl stockhaus carmichael johannes van der corput axel thue and duarte the case was proven independently legendre and peter gustav lejeune dirichlet around alternative proofs were developed carl friedrich gauss posthumous lebesgue lam gambioli werebrusow rychl van der corput and guy terjanian the case was proven his rather complicated proof was simplified and still simpler proofs were published angelo genocchi and alternative proofs were developed ophile pin and edmond maillet fermat last theorem has also been proven for the exponents and proofs for have been published thue tafelmacher lind kapferer swift and similarly dirichlet and terjanian each proved the case while kapferer and breusch each proved the case strictly these proofs are since these cases follow from the proofs for and respectively nevertheless the reasoning these exponent proofs differs from their exponent dirichlet proof for was published before proof for many proofs for specific exponents use technique infinite descent which fermat used prove the case but many however the details and auxiliary arguments are often hoc and tied the individual exponent under since they became ever more complicated increased seemed unlikely that the general case last theorem could proven building upon the proofs for individual although some general results last theorem were published the early century niels henrik abel and peter barlow the first significant work the general theorem was done sophie germain sophie germain sophie germain the early sophie germain developed several novel approaches prove last theorem for all first she defined set auxiliary primes constructed from the prime exponent the equation where any integer not divisible she showed integers raised the power were adjacent modulo the non consecutivity condition then must divide the product xyz her goal was use mathematical induction prove for any given infinitely many auxiliary primes satisfied the consecutivity condition and thus divided xyz since the product xyz can have most finite number prime such proof would have established last although she developed many techniques for establishing the consecutivity she did not succeed her strategic she also worked set lower limits the size solutions equation for given exponent modified version which was published adrien marie legendre byproduct this latter she proved sophie theorem which verified the first case last theorem the case which does not divide xyz for every odd prime exponent less than germain tried unsuccessfully prove the first case last theorem for all even specifically for which was proven guy terjanian leonard adleman roger brown and tienne fouvry proved that the first case last theorem holds for infinitely many odd primes ernst kummer and the theory ideals gabriel outlined proof last theorem based factoring the equation complex specifically the cyclotomic field based the roots the number his proof however because assumed incorrectly that such complex numbers can factored uniquely into similar this gap was pointed out immediately joseph liouville who later read paper that demonstrated this failure unique written ernst kummer kummer set himself the task determining whether the cyclotomic field could generalized include new prime numbers such that unique factorisation was succeeded that task developing the ideal numbers using the general approach outlined kummer proved both cases last theorem for all regular prime numbers however could not prove the theorem for the exceptional primes irregular primes that conjecturally occur approximately the the only irregular primes below are and mordell conjecture the louis mordell posed conjecture that implied that equation has most finite number nontrivial primitive integer the exponent greater than this conjecture was proven gerd faltings and now known faltings theorem computational studies the latter half the computational methods were used extend approach the irregular harry vandiver used swac computer prove last theorem for all primes samuel wagstaff had extended this all primes less than fermat last theorem had been proven for all primes less than four however despite these efforts and their proof existed last proofs individual exponents their nature could never prove the general case even all exponents were verified extremely large number higher exponent beyond might still exist for which the claim was not this had been the case with some other past and could not ruled out this connection with elliptic curves the strategy that ultimately led successful proof last theorem arose from the astounding taniyama weil conjecture proposed around which many mathematicians believed would near impossible and which was linked the gerhard frey jean pierre serre and ken ribet accomplishing partial proof this conjecture andrew wiles ultimately succeeded proving last well leading the way full proof others what now the modularity theorem the weil conjecture modularity theorem around japanese mathematicians goro shimura and yutaka taniyama observed possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches elliptic curves and modular forms the resulting modularity theorem the time known the shimura states that every elliptic curve modular meaning that can associated with unique modular form was initially dismissed unlikely highly and was taken more seriously when number theorist andr weil found evidence supporting but result the conjecture was often known the weil became part the langlands programme list important conjectures needing proof even after gaining serious the conjecture was seen contemporary mathematicians extraordinarily difficult perhaps inaccessible for wiles supervisor john coates states that seemed impossible actually and ken ribet considered himself one the vast majority people who believed was completely adding that andrew wiles was probably one the few people earth who had the audacity dream that you can actually and prove frey equation ribet theorem frey curve theorem gerhard frey noted link between equation and the modularity then still equation had any solution for exponent then could shown that the elliptic curve now known frey curve note would have such unusual properties that was unlikely this would conflict with the modularity which asserted that all elliptic curves are frey observed that proof the weil conjecture would simultaneously prove last theorem and disproof refutation last theorem would disprove the following this proof last theorem required two first was necessary show that intuition was that elliptic curve were constructed this using set numbers that were solution the resulting elliptic curve could not frey did not quite succeed proving this the missing piece the called epsilon conjecture now known ribet theorem was identified jean pierre serre citation needed and proven ken ribet second was necessary prove the modularity theorem least prove for the class cases known semistable elliptic curves that included equation and this was widely believed inaccessible proof contemporary the modularity theorem proven would mean all elliptic curves least all semistable elliptic are necessity ribet theorem proven showed solution equation could used create semistable elliptic curve that was not the contradiction would imply the modularity theorem were that solutions can exist equation therefore proving last wiles general proof andrew wiles andrew wiles proof last theorem proof the epsilon conjecture accomplished the first the two goals proposed upon hearing andrew wiles english mathematician with childhood fascination with last and prior study area elliptical decided commit himself accomplishing the second proving special case the modularity theorem then known the shimura for semistable elliptic wiles worked that task for six years total covering his efforts releasing prior work small segments separate papers and confiding only his his initial study suggested proof induction and based his initial work and first significant breakthrough galois theory before switching attempt extend horizontal iwasawa theory for the inductive argument around when seemed that there was existing approach adequate the however the summer iwasawa theory also seemed not reaching the central issues the approached colleagues seek out any hints cutting edge research and new and discovered euler system recently developed victor kolyvagin and matthias flach that seemed tailor for the inductive part his wiles studied and extended this which since his work relied extensively this which was new mathematics and january asked his princeton nick katz check his reasoning for subtle their conclusion the time was that the techniques used wiles seemed working may wiles felt able tell his wife thought had solved the proof last and june felt sufficiently confident present his results three lectures delivered june the isaac newton institute for mathematical sciences specifically wiles presented his proof the shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic together with proof the epsilon this implied last however became apparent during peer review that critical point the proof was contained error bound the order particular group the error was caught several mathematicians refereeing manuscript including katz his role who alerted wiles august the error would not have rendered his work worthless each part work was highly significant and innovative were the many developments and techniques had created the course his and only one part was however without this part there was actual proof last wiles spent almost year trying repair his initially himself and then collaboration with richard taylor without september the verge giving wiles had flash insight that the proof could saved returning his original horizontal iwasawa theory which had abandoned favour the flach this time strengthening with expertise gained october wiles submitted two modular elliptic curves and last and ring theoretic properties certain hecke the second which was authored with taylor and proved that certain conditions were met that were needed justify the corrected step the main the two papers were vetted and published the entirety the may issue the annals mathematics these papers established the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic the last step proving last years after was subsequent developments the full weil conjecture was finally proved diamond conrad diamond taylor and breuil who building work incrementally chipped away the remaining cases until the full result was the now fully proved conjecture became known the modularity several other theorems number theory similar last theorem also follow from the same using the modularity for cube can written sum two coprime the case was already known euler exponents other than positive integers rational exponents all solutions the diophantine equation when were computed lenstra the case which the roots are required real and all solutions are given for positive integers with and coprime for bennett glass and szekely proved that then there are integer solutions and only divides and and are different complex roots the same real negative exponents all primitive pairwise integer solutions can written for coprime integers the case also has infinitude and these have geometric interpretation terms right triangles with integer sides and integer altitude the hypotenuse all primitive solutions are given for coprime integers with the geometric interpretation that and are the integer legs right triangle and the integer altitude the then the hypotenuse itself the integer pythagorean triple integer there are solutions integers for for integer there the equation could multiplied through obtain which impossible last values other than positive integers fermat last theorem can easily extended positive can have because any solution could rearranged which last theorem monetary prizes and again the french academy sciences offered prize for general proof last the academy awarded francs and gold medal kummer for his research ideal although had not submitted entry for the another prize was offered the academy the german industrialist and amateur mathematician paul wolfskehl bequeathed marks the ttingen academy sciences offered prize for complete proof last june the academy published nine rules for awarding the among other these rules required that the proof published reviewed the prize would not awarded until two years after the and that prize would given after september roughly century after the competition was wiles collected the wolfskehl prize then worth june prior proof thousands incorrect proofs were submitted the wolfskehl amounting roughly feet meters the first year alone attempted proofs were although the the rate submission had decreased roughly attempted proofs per according schlichting wolfskehl most the proofs were based elementary methods taught and often submitted people with technical education but failed the words mathematical historian howard eves last theorem has the peculiar distinction being the mathematical problem for which the greatest number incorrect proofs have been see also beal conjecture diophantus viii sum powers conjecture last theorem
