mathematics	finite geometry navigation search finite geometry any geometric system that has only finite number points the familiar euclidean geometry not because euclidean line contains infinitely many geometry based the graphics displayed computer where the pixels are considered the would finite while there are many systems that could called finite attention mostly paid the finite projective and affine spaces because their regularity and other significant types finite geometry are finite bius inversive planes and laguerre planes which are examples general type called benz planes and their dimensional analogs such higher finite inversive geometries finite geometries may constructed via linear algebra starting from vector spaces over finite field the affine and projective planes constructed are called galois geometries finite geometries can also defined purely most common finite geometries are galois since any finite projective space dimension three greater isomorphic projective space over finite field that the projectivization vector space over finite however dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic galois namely the non desarguesian planes similar results hold for other kinds finite contents finite affine and projective planes order planes history finite spaces more dimensions axiomatic definition algebraic construction classification finite projective spaces geometric dimension the smallest projective space kirkman schoolgirl problem see also notes references external links finite affine and projective planes the following remarks apply only finite planes there are two main kinds finite plane affine and projective affine plane the normal sense parallel lines projective plane any two lines intersect unique parallel lines not both finite affine plane geometry and finite projective plane geometry may described fairly simple axioms affine plane geometry nonempty set whose elements are called points along with nonempty collection subsets whose elements are called lines such for every two distinct there exactly one line that contains both playfair axiom given line and point not there exists exactly one line containing such that there exists set four three which belong the same the last axiom ensures that the geometry not trivial either empty too simple such single line with arbitrary number points while the first two specify the nature the the simplest affine plane contains only four called the affine plane order since three are any pair points determines unique and this plane contains six corresponds tetrahedron where intersecting edges are considered parallel square where not only opposite but also diagonals are considered parallel more finite affine plane order has points and lines each line contains points and each point lines the affine plane order known the hesse configuration projective plane geometry nonempty set whose elements are called points along with nonempty collection subsets whose elements are called lines such for every two distinct there exactly one line that contains both the intersection any two distinct lines contains exactly one there exists set four three which belong the same fano plane examination the first two axioms shows that they are nearly except that the roles points and lines have been this suggests the principle duality for projective plane meaning that any true statement valid all these geometries remains true exchange points for lines and lines for the smallest geometry satisfying all three axioms contains seven this simplest the projective there are also seven each point three and each line contains three fano plane this particular projective plane sometimes called the fano plane any the lines removed from the along with the points that the resulting geometry the affine plane order the fano plane called the projective plane order because unique the projective plane order has points and the same number each line contains points and each point lines permutation the fano seven points that carries collinear points points the same collinear points called collineation the the full collineation group order and isomorphic the group psl psl which this special case also isomorphic the general linear group pgl order planes finite plane order one such that each line has points for affine such that each line has points for projective one major open question finite geometry the order finite plane always prime this conjectured affine and projective planes order exist whenever prime power prime number raised positive integer exponent using affine and projective planes over the finite field with elements planes not derived from finite fields also but all known examples have order prime the best general result date the bruck ryser theorem which positive integer squares the smallest integer that not prime power and not covered the ryser theorem the form but equal the sum squares the existence finite plane order was proven computer assisted proof that finished see lam for the next smallest number consider for which neither positive nor negative result has been history the first finite projective geometry was developed the italian mathematician gino fano his work proving the independence the set axioms for projective space that produced finite three dimensional space with points lines and planes see diagram which each line had only three points the planes this space consisted seven points and seven lines and are now known fano planes see diagram finite spaces more dimensions for some important differences between finite plane geometry and the geometry dimensional finite see axiomatic projective space for discussion dimensional finite spaces see for the works hirschfeld the study these dimensional spaces has many important applications advanced mathematical axiomatic definition projective space can defined axiomatically set the set together with set subsets the set satisfying these each two distinct points and are exactly one veblen are distinct points and the lines through and meet then the lines through and any line has least points the last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can written disjoint union projective spaces together with point lines joining any two points distinct projective more can defined incidence structure consisting set set and incidence relation stating which points lie which obtaining finite projective space requires one more the set points finite any finite projective each line contains the same number points and the order the space defined one less than this common subspace the projective space subset such that any line containing two points subset that completely contained the full space and the empty space are always the geometric dimension the space said that the largest number for which there strictly ascending chain subspaces this algebraic construction standard algebraic construction systems satisfies these for division ring construct dimensional vector space over vector space dimension the number elements let the dimensional single subspaces and the dimensional two independent subspaces closed under vector this vector incidence finite then this constructs finite projective for finite projective spaces geometric dimension least wedderburn little theorem implies that the division ring over which the projective space defined must finite field whose order that number prime finite projective space defined over such finite field has points the two concepts order such finite projective space denoted where stands for projective the geometric dimension the geometry and the size the finite field used construct the the number dimensional subspaces given the which gaussian binomial coefficient analogue binomial coefficient classification finite projective spaces geometric dimension dimension the space single point and degenerate that usually dimension exactly one all points lie the unique called projective line dimension there are least lines and any two lines projective space for projective plane these are much harder not all them are isomorphic with the desarguesian planes those that are isomorphic with satisfy desargues theorem and are projective planes over finite but there are many non desarguesian planes dimension least two intersecting lines the veblen young theorem states the finite case that every projective space geometric dimension isomorphic with the dimensional projective space over some finite field the smallest projective space the smallest dimensional projective space over the field and denoted has points lines and planes each the planes contains points and lines these planes are isomorphic the fano plane every point contained lines and every line contains three two distinct points are contained exactly one line and two planes intersect exactly one gino fano was the first consider such finite geometry three dimensional geometry containing points lines and planes with each plane containing points and lines kirkman schoolgirl problem can arise solution kirkman schoolgirl problem which fifteen schoolgirls walk each day five groups arrange
