four color theorem navigation search mathematics the four color theorem the four color map theorem states given any separation plane into contiguous regions producing figure called map more than four colors are required color the regions the map that two adjacent regions have the same two regions are called adjacent they share common boundary that not where corners are the points shared three more for the map the united states utah and arizona are but utah and new which only share point that also belongs arizona and are despite the motivation from coloring political maps countries the theorem not particular interest according article the math historian kenneth may wilson maps utilizing only four colors are and those that usually require only books cartography and the history mapmaking not mention the color three colors are adequate for simpler but additional fourth color required for some such map which one region surrounded odd number other regions that touch each other the five color theorem which has short elementary states that five colors suffice color map and was proven the late century heawood however proving that four colors suffice turned out significantly number false proofs and false counterexamples have appeared since the first statement the four color theorem the four color theorem was proven kenneth appel and wolfgang haken was the first major theorem proved using computer appel and approach started showing that there particular set maps each which cannot part sized counterexample the four color they did you could make smaller appel and haken used purpose computer program confirm that each these maps had this additionally any map that could potentially counterexample must have portion that looks like one these maps showing this required hundreds pages hand appel and haken concluded that smallest counterexamples existed because any must yet not one these maps this contradiction means there are counterexamples all and that the theorem therefore initially their proof was not accepted all mathematicians because the computer assisted proof was infeasible for human check hand swart since then the proof has gained wider although doubts remain wilson dispel remaining doubt about the haken simpler proof using the same ideas and still relying computers was published sanders seymour and additionally the theorem was proven georges gonthier with general purpose theorem proving software contents precise formulation the theorem history early proof attempts proof computer simplification and verification summary proof ideas false disproofs generalizations see also notes references external links precise formulation the theorem the intuitive statement the four color that given any separation plane into contiguous called the regions can colored using most four colors that two adjacent regions have the same needs interpreted appropriately first all points that belong are the closure three more must bizarre maps using regions finite area but infinite can require more than four azerbaijan for the purpose the theorem every country has connected region contiguous the real this not true michigan and its upper peninsula nakhchivan part azerbaijan and kaliningrad part russia are not because the territory particular country must the same four colors may not for consider simplified this the two regions labeled belong the same and must the same this map then requires five since the two regions together are contiguous with four other each which contiguous with all the consisted three six more colors might one can construct maps that require arbitrarily high number similar construction also applies single color used for all bodies usual real easier state version the theorem uses graph theory the set regions map can represented more abstractly undirected graph that has vertex for each region and edge for every pair regions that share boundary this graph planar important note that are talking about the graphs that have some limitations according the map they are transformed from can drawn the plane without crossings placing each vertex arbitrarily chosen location within the region which and drawing the edges curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location each shared boundary point the conversely any planar graph can formed from map this theoretic the color theorem states that the vertices every planar graph can colored with most four colors that two adjacent vertices receive the same for every planar graph thomas wilson history early proof attempts bius mentioned the problem his lectures early the conjecture was first proposed october when francis guthrie while trying color the map counties noticed that only four different colors were the guthrie frederick was student augustus morgan the former advisor university college london francis inquired with frederick regarding who then took morgan francis guthrie graduated later and later became professor mathematics south according student mine asked day give him reason for fact which did not know was fact and not says that figure any how divided and the compartments differently colored that figures with any portion common boundary line are differently colored four colors may wanted but not more the following his case which four colors are wanted query cannot necessity for five more wilson perhaps one the two published the question the athenaeum and morgan posed the question again the same magazine another early published reference arthur cayley turn credits the conjecture there were several early failed attempts proving the morgan believed that followed from simple fact about four though believe that fact could derived from more elementary this arises the following never need four colors neighborhood unless there four each which has boundary lines common with each the other such thing cannot happen with four areas unless one more them inclosed the and the color used for the inclosed county thus set free now this that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without fully capable demonstration upon anything more evident and more must stand one alleged proof was given alfred kempe which was widely another was given peter guthrie tait was not until that proof was shown incorrect percy heawood and tait proof was shown incorrect julius petersen each false proof stood unchallenged for years thomas addition exposing the flaw heawood proved the five color theorem heawood and generalized the four color conjecture surfaces arbitrary see tait showed that the four color theorem equivalent the statement that certain type graph called snark modern must planar hugo hadwiger formulated the hadwiger conjecture hadwiger reaching generalization the color problem that still remains proof computer during the and german mathematician heinrich heesch developed methods using computers search for notably was the first use discharging for proving the which turned out important the unavoidability portion the subsequent haken also expanded the concept reducibility along with ken developed computer test for unfortunately this critical was unable procure the necessary supercomputer time continue his work wilson others took his methods and his assisted while other teams mathematicians were racing complete kenneth appel and wolfgang haken the university illinois announced june that they had proven the they were assisted some algorithmic work john koch wilson the color conjecture were there would least one map with the smallest possible number regions that requires five the proof showed that such minimal counterexample cannot through the use two technical concepts wilson appel haken thomas unavoidable set set configurations such that every map that satisfies some necessary conditions for being minimal colorable triangulation such having minimum degree must have least one configuration from this reducible configuration arrangement countries that cannot occur minimal map contains reducible then the map can reduced smaller this smaller map has the condition that can colored with four then the original map can this implies that the original map cannot colored with four colors the smaller map either and the original map not using mathematical rules and procedures based properties reducible appel and haken found unavoidable set reducible thus proving that minimal counterexample the color conjecture could not their proof reduced the infinitude possible maps reducible configurations later reduced which had checked one one computer and took over thousand this reducibility part the work was independently double checked with different programs and however the unavoidability part the proof was verified over pages microfiche which had checked hand appel haken appel and announcement was widely reported the news media around the and the math department the university illinois used postmark stating four colors the same time the unusual nature the was the first major theorem proven with extensive computer and the complexity the verifiable aroused considerable controversy wilson the early rumors spread flaw the haken ulrich schmidt rwth aachen examined appel and proof for his thesis wilson had checked about the unavoidability portion and found significant error the discharging procedure appel haken appel and haken were asked the editor mathematical intelligencer write article addressing the rumors flaws their they responded that the rumors were due misinterpretation results and obliged with detailed article wilson their magnum opus every planar map colorable book claiming complete and detailed proof with microfiche supplement over pages appeared and explained discovery and several further errors found others appel haken simplification and verification since the proving the efficient algorithms have been found for coloring maps requiring only time where the number neil robertson daniel sanders paul seymour and robin thomas created quadratic time algorithm improving quartic algorithm based appel and proof thomas robertson this new proof similar appel and but more efficient because reduces the complexity the problem and requires checking only reducible both the unavoidability and reducibility parts this new proof must executed computer and are impractical check hand thomas the same authors announced alternative proving the snark theorem thomas pegg benjamin werner and georges gonthier formalized proof the theorem inside the coq proof this removed the need trust the various computer programs used verify particular only necessary trust the coq kernel gonthier summary proof ideas the following discussion summary based the introduction appel and book every planar map four colorable appel haken although kempe original purported proof the four color theorem provided some the basic tools later used prove the explanation here reworded terms the modern graph theory formulation kempe argument goes first planar regions separated the graph are not triangulated not have exactly three edges their can add edges without introducing new vertices order make every region including the unbounded outer this triangulated graph colorable using four colors the original graph since the same coloring valid edges are suffices prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs prove for all planar and without loss generality assume the graph suppose and are the number edges and regions since each region triangular and each edge shared two have that this together with euler formula can used show that now the degree vertex the number edges abutting the number vertices degree and the maximum degree any but since and for all this demonstrates that there least one vertex degree there graph requiring colors then there minimal such where removing any vertex makes call this graph cannot have vertex degree because can remove from four color the smaller then add back and extend the coloring choosing color different from its kempe also showed correctly that can have vertex degree before remove the vertex and color the remaining all four neighbors are different say green blue and yellow clockwise look for alternating path vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue such path called kempe chain there may kempe chain joining the red and blue and there may kempe chain joining the green and yellow but not since these two paths would necessarily and the vertex where they intersect cannot suppose the red and blue neighbors that are not chained explore all vertices attached the red neighbor blue alternating and then reverse the colors red and blue all these the result still valid and can now added back and colored this leaves only the case where has vertex degree but argument was flawed for this heawood noticed mistake and also observed that one was satisfied with proving only five colors are one could run through the above argument changing only that the minimal counterexample requires colors and use kempe chains the degree situation prove the five color theorem any deal with this degree vertex case requires more complicated notion than removing rather the form the argument generalized considering configurations which are connected subgraphs with the degree each vertex specified for the case described degree vertex situation the configuration consisting single vertex labelled having degree suffices demonstrate that the configuration removed and the remaining graph then the coloring can modified such way that when the configuration the coloring can extended configuration for which this possible called reducible configuration least one set configurations must occur somewhere that set called unavoidable the argument above began giving unavoidable set five configurations single vertex with degree single vertex with degree single vertex with degree and then proceeded show that the first are exhibit unavoidable set configurations where every configuration the set reducible would prove the because the degree each vertex configuration and all edges internal the configuration are the number vertices adjacent given configuration and they are joined these vertices form the ring the configuration with vertices its ring ring and the configuration together with its ring called the ringed configuration the simple cases one may enumerate all distinct colorings the any coloring that can extended without modification coloring the configuration called initially good for the vertex configuration above with less neighbors were initially the surrounding graph must systematically recolored turn the coloring into good was done the case above where there were neighbors for general configuration with larger this requires more complex because the large number distinct colorings the this the primary step requiring computer finally remains identify unavoidable set configurations amenable reduction this the primary method used discover such set the method discharging the intuitive idea underlying discharging consider the planar graph electrical initially positive and negative electrical distributed amongst the vertices that the total recall the formula each vertex assigned initial charge then one flows the charge systematically redistributing the charge from vertex its neighboring vertices according set the discharging procedure since charge some vertices still have positive the rules restrict the possibilities for configurations charged enumerating all such possible configurations gives unavoidable long some member the unavoidable set not the discharging procedure modified eliminate while introducing other appel and final discharging procedure was extremely complex together with description the resulting unavoidable configuration filled page but the configurations generated could checked mechanically verifying the volume describing the unavoidable configuration set itself was done peer review over period several technical detail not discussed here but required complete the proof immersion reducibility false disproofs the four color theorem has been notorious for attracting large number false proofs and disproofs its long the new york times refused matter policy report the haken fearing that the proof would shown false like the ones before wilson some alleged like and mentioned stood under public scrutiny for over decade before they were but many authored were never published generally the though counterexamples attempt create one region which touches all other this forces the remaining regions colored with only three because the four color theorem this always however because the person drawing the map focused the one large they fail notice that the remaining regions can fact colored with three this trick can there are many maps where the colors some regions are selected becomes impossible color the remaining regions without exceeding four casual verifier the counterexample may not think change the colors these that the counterexample will appear though perhaps one effect underlying this common misconception the fact that the color restriction not transitive region only has colored differently from regions touches not regions touching regions that this were the planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers other false disproofs violate the assumptions the theorem unexpected such using region that consists multiple disconnected disallowing regions the same color from touching generalizations torus the color theorem applies not only finite planar but also infinite graphs that can drawn without crossings the and even more generally infinite graphs possibly with uncountable number for which every finite subgraph prove one can combine proof the theorem for finite planar graphs with the theorem stating every finite subgraph infinite graph then the whole graph also colorable nash williams this can also seen immediate consequence kurt del compactness theorem for first order logic simply expressing the colorability infinite graph with set logical one can also consider the coloring problem surfaces other than the plane weisstein the problem the sphere cylinder equivalent that the for closed orientable surfaces with positive genus the maximum number colors needed depends the euler characteristic according the formula where the outermost brackets denote the floor function alternatively for orientable surface the formula can given terms the genus weisstein this the heawood conjecture was conjectured heawood and proven gerhard ringel and youngs the only exception the formula the klein bottle which has euler characteristic hence the formula gives and requires colors shown franklin weisstein for the torus has euler characteristic and genus and thus more than colors are required color any map the szilassi polyhedron example that requires seven bius strip requires six colors weisstein planar graphs graphs drawn with most one simple crossing per borodin both the vertices and the faces planar graph are such way that two adjacent faces face pair have the same then again most six colors are needed borodin there obvious extension the coloring result dimensional solid using set flexible one can arrange that every rod touches every other the set would then require colors you consider the empty space that also touches every the number can taken any large such examples were known fredrick guthrie wilson even for parallel cuboids considered adjacent when two cuboids share dimensional boundary unbounded number colors may necessary reed allwright magnant martin see also graph coloring theorem free nelson problem list sets four countries that border one
