self similar pattern fractals can also nearly the same different this latter pattern illustrated figure fractals also includes the idea detailed pattern that repeats fractals are different from other geometric figures because the complex ratio which they this ratio called fractal dimensional scaling and changes the scale which simply fractal has complex scaling ratio that usually exceeds the shape the space referred topological dimension and may fall between the mathematical fractals are usually nowhere differentiable infinite fractal curve can conceived winding through space differently from ordinary still being dimensional line yet having fractal dimension indicating also resembles the mathematical roots the idea fractals have been traced throughout the years formal path published starting the century with notions recursion then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment the concept the study continuous but not differentiable functions the and the coining the word fractal the century with subsequent burgeoning interest fractals and based modelling the the term fractal was first used mathematician beno mandelbrot mandelbrot based the latin ctus meaning broken fractured and used extend the concept theoretical fractional dimensions geometric patterns nature there some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept fractal should formally mandelbrot himself summarized damn increasingly that the general consensus that theoretical fractals are infinitely iterated and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal which many examples have been formulated and studied great fractals are not limited geometric but can also describe processes fractal patterns with various degrees similarity have been rendered studied structures and sounds and found nature technology art and law contents introduction history characteristics brownian motion common techniques for generating fractals simulated fractals natural phenomena with fractal features creative works applications technology law see also fractal generating programs notes references further reading external links introduction the word fractal often has different connotations for laypeople than for where the layperson more likely familiar with fractal art than mathematical the mathematical concept difficult define formally even for but key features can understood with little mathematical the feature for easily understood analogy zooming with lens other device that zooms digital images uncover previously new this done however new detail nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and for some nearly the same pattern reappears over and self similarity itself not necessarily intuitive people have pondered similarity informally such the infinite regress parallel mirrors the homunculus the little man inside the head the little man inside the the difference for fractals that the pattern reproduced must this idea being detailed relates another feature that can understood without mathematical having fractional fractal dimension greater than its topological for refers how fractal scales compared how geometric shapes are usually regular for conventionally understood such curve divided into pieces each the length the there are always equal consider the curve figure also dimensional for the same reason the ordinary but fractal dimension greater than because how its detail can the fractal curve divided into parts the length the original line becomes pieces rearranged repeat the original and this unusual relationship the basis its fractal dimension this also leads understanding third that fractals mathematical equations are nowhere differentiable concrete this means fractals cannot measured traditional trying find the length wavy fractal one could find straight segments some measuring tool small enough lay end end over the where the pieces could get small enough considered conform the curve the normal manner measuring with tape but measuring wavy fractal curve such the one figure one would never find small enough straight segment conform the because the wavy pattern would always albeit smaller essentially pulling little more the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted fit tighter and tighter the this perhaps but how fractals history koch snowflake koch snowflake the history fractals traces path from chiefly theoretical studies modern applications computer with several notable people contributing canonical fractal forms along the according the mathematics behind fractals began take shape the century when the mathematician and philosopher gottfried leibniz pondered recursive self similarity although made the mistake thinking that only the straight line was similar this his leibniz used the term fractional but lamented that geometry did not yet know indeed according various historical after that point few mathematicians tackled the issues and the work those who did remained obscured largely because resistance such unfamiliar emerging which were sometimes referred mathematical monsters thus was not until two centuries had passed that karl weierstrass presented the first definition function with graph that would today considered having the intuitive property being everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable not long after georg cantor who attended lectures published examples subsets the real line known cantor sets which had unusual properties and are now recognized also the last part that felix klein and henri introduced category fractal that has come called fractals julia set one the next milestones came when helge von koch extending ideas and dissatisfied with abstract and analytic gave more geometric definition including hand drawn images similar which now called the koch curve see figure another milestone came decade later when wac ski constructed his famous triangle then one year his carpet two french pierre fatou and gaston julia though working arrived essentially simultaneously results describing what are now seen fractal behaviour associated with mapping complex numbers and iterative functions and leading further ideas about attractors and repellors points that attract repel other which have become very important the study fractals see figure and figure very shortly after that work was march felix hausdorff expanded the definition dimension significantly for the evolution the definition allow for sets have noninteger the idea similar curves was taken further paul who his paper plane space curves and surfaces consisting parts similar the whole described new fractal the curve notes strange attractor multifractal different researchers have postulated that without the aid modern computer early investigators were limited what they could depict manual lacked the means visualize the beauty and appreciate some the implications many the patterns they had discovered the julia for could only visualized through few iterations very simple drawings hardly resembling the image figure that however the when beno mandelbrot started writing about similarity papers such how long the coast statistical similarity and fractional dimension which built earlier work lewis fry richardson mandelbrot solidified hundreds years thought and mathematical development coining the word fractal and illustrated his mathematical definition with striking constructed these such his canonical mandelbrot set pictured figure captured the popular many them were based leading the popular meaning the term fractal currently fractal studies are essentially exclusively characteristics one often cited description that mandelbrot published describe geometric fractals rough fragmented geometric shape that can split into each which least size copy the this generally helpful but authorities disagree the exact definition fractal but most usually elaborate the basic ideas similarity and unusual relationship with the space fractal embedded one point agreed that fractal patterns are characterized fractal dimensions but whereas these numbers quantify complexity changing detail with changing they neither uniquely describe nor specify details how construct particular fractal when mandelbrot coined the word fractal did denote object whose hausdorff besicovitch dimension greater than its topological dimension has been noted that this dimensional requirement not met fractal space filling curves such the hilbert curve notes according rather than being strictly fractals addition being nowhere differentiable and able have fractal dimension generally characterized gestalt the following self which may manifested exact identical all koch snowflake quasi approximates the same pattern different may contain small copies the entire fractal distorted and degenerate the mandelbrot set satellites are approximations the entire but not exact shown figure statistical repeats pattern stochastically numerical statistical measures are preserved across randomly generated fractals the known example the coastline britain for which one would not expect find segment scaled and repeated neatly the repeated unit that for the koch snowflake qualitative time series multifractal scaling characterized more than one fractal dimension scaling rule fine detailed structure arbitrarily small consequence this structure fractals may have emergent properties related the next criterion this irregularity locally and globally that not easily described traditional euclidean geometric language for images fractal this has been expressed phrases such smoothly piling and swirls upon simple and perhaps recursive definitions see common techniques for generating fractals these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain such those that may similar without having other typically fractal straight for similar but not fractal because lacks easily described euclidean has the same hausdorff dimension topological dimension and fully

benchmarks for fractal analysis some specific applications fractals technology are listed elsewhere images and other outputs modelling are normally referred being fractals even they not have strictly
