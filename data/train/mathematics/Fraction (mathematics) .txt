fraction navigation search fraction from fractus broken represents part whole more any number equal when spoken everyday fraction describes how many parts certain size there for one eight three common vulgar simple fraction and consists integer numerator displayed above line before and zero integer denominator displayed below that numerators and denominators are also used fractions that are not common including compound complex and mixed the numerator represents number equal and the which cannot indicates how many those parts make unit for the fraction the tells that the fraction represents equal and the tells that parts make the picture the right illustrates fractional numbers can also written without using explicit numerators using percent negative exponents and respectively all which are equivalent integer such the number can thought having implied denominator equals other uses for fractions are represent ratios and represent division thus the fraction also used represent the ratio the ratio the part the and the division three divided mathematics the set all numbers which can expressed the form where and are integers and not called the set rational numbers and represented the symbol which stands for quotient the test for number being rational number that can written that form common however the word fraction also used describe mathematical expressions that are not rational for example algebraic fractions quotients algebraic and expressions that contain irrational numbers such see square root and see proof that irrational contents vocabulary forms fractions simple common vulgar fractions proper and improper fractions mixed numbers ratios reciprocals and the invisible complex fractions compound fractions decimal fractions and percentages special cases arithmetic with fractions equivalent fractions comparing fractions addition adding unlike quantities subtraction multiplication multiplying fraction another fraction multiplying fraction whole number mixed numbers division converting between decimals and fractions converting repeating decimals fractions fractions abstract mathematics algebraic fractions radical expressions typographical variations history formal education pedagogical tools documents for teachers see also references external links vocabulary the examples and the slanting line called solidus forward slash the examples and the horizontal line called vinculum informally fraction when reading fractions customary english pronounce the denominator using the corresponding ordinal number plural the numerator not fifths for fractions with the thus rendered three fifths and five seconds this generally applies whole number denominators greater than though large denominators that are not powers ten are often rendered using the cardinal number thus might rendered five but often five over one hundred because one million power usually expressed six six rather than six over one the denominators and are special the fraction may spoken three wholes the denominator expressed half plural halves minus halves negative halves the fraction may either three three furthermore since most fractions prose function the fractional modifier this evident standard prose which one might write about every tenths the mile the three fifths compromise when the numerator then the word one may such every tenth during the final quarter the forms fractions simple common vulgar fractions simple fraction also known common fraction vulgar fraction rational number written where and are both integers with other the denominator cannot examples include and simple fractions can positive proper improper see compound complex mixed and decimals see are not simple fractions though unless they can evaluated simple proper and improper fractions common fractions can classified either proper when the numerator and the denominator are both the fraction called proper the numerator less than the and improper common fraction said proper fraction the absolute value the fraction strictly less than that the fraction greater than and less than said improper fraction sometimes informally top heavy fraction the absolute value the fraction greater than equal examples proper fractions are and examples improper fractions are and mixed numbers mixed numeral often called mixed number also called mixed fraction the sum zero integer and proper this sum implied without the use any visible operator such for referring two entire cakes and three quarters another the whole and fractional parts the number are written next each this not confused with the algebra rule implied when two algebraic expressions are written next each the operation multiplication said understood for example not mixed instead multiplication understood where avoid the multiplication often explicitly may written improper fraction another way write whole plus mixed number can converted improper fraction write the mixed number sum convert the whole number improper fraction with the same denominator the fractional add the the resulting sum the improper the similarly improper fraction can converted mixed number divide the numerator the the divide with remainder the quotient without the becomes the whole number part the mixed the remainder becomes the numerator the fractional the the whole number part and the numerator the fractional the new denominator the same the denominator the improper the they are both thus mixed numbers can also which equals ratios ratio relationship between two more numbers that can sometimes expressed typically number items are grouped and compared specifying numerically the relationship between each ratios are expressed group group group for car lot had vehicles which are are and are then the ratio red white yellow cars the ratio yellow cars white cars and may expressed ratio often converted fraction when expressed ratio the the above the ratio yellow cars all the cars the lot can convert these ratios fraction and say that the cars the cars the lot are therefore person randomly chose one car the then there one three chance probability that would reciprocals and the invisible the reciprocal fraction another fraction with the numerator and denominator the reciprocal for the product fraction and its reciprocal hence the reciprocal the multiplicative inverse any integer can written fraction with the number one for can written where sometimes referred the invisible denominator therefore every fraction integer except for zero has the reciprocal complex fractions not confused with fractions involving complex numbers complex fraction either the the fraction mixed corresponding division for and are complex reduce complex fraction simple treat the longest fraction line representing for complex there clear way tell which fraction lines takes then the expression improperly and thus poorly constructed mathematical with multiple possible compound fractions compound fraction fraction any number fractions connected with the word corresponding multiplication reduce compound fraction simple just carry out the multiplication see the section multiplication for compound corresponding the terms compound fraction and complex fraction are closely related and sometimes one used synonym for the decimal fractions and percentages decimal fraction fraction whose denominator not given but understood integer power decimal fractions are commonly expressed using decimal notation which the implied denominator determined the number digits the right decimal separator the appearance which raised period depends the locale for see decimal separator thus for the numerator and the implied denominator the second viz because there are two digits the right the decimal decimal numbers greater than such the fractional part the number expressed the digits the right the decimal with value this can written either improper mixed decimal fractions can also expressed using scientific notation with negative such which represents the represents denominator dividing moves the decimal point places the decimal fractions with infinitely many digits the right the decimal separator represent infinite series for represents the infinite series another kind fraction the percentage latin per centum meaning per represented the which the implied denominator always thus means percentages greater than less than zero are treated the same equals and equals the related concept permille parts per thousand has implied denominator while the more general parts per notation parts per means that the proportion whether common fractions decimal fractions are used often matter taste and common fractions are used most often when the denominator relatively mental calculation easier multiply than the same calculation using the decimal equivalent and more accurate multiply for than multiply any decimal approximation one monetary values are commonly expressed decimal for example however noted decimal british shillings and pence were often given the form but not the for example read three and meaning shillings and pence and having relationship the fraction special cases unit fraction vulgar fraction with numerator unit fractions can also expressed using negative which represents and which represents egyptian fraction the sum distinct positive unit for example this definition derives from the fact that the ancient egyptians expressed all fractions except and this every positive rational number can expanded egyptian for can written any positive rational number can written sum unit fractions infinitely many two ways write are and dyadic fraction vulgar fraction which the denominator power two arithmetic with fractions like whole fractions obey the commutative associative and distributive laws and the rule against division zero equivalent fractions multiplying the numerator and denominator fraction the same number results fraction that equivalent the original this true because for any zero number the fraction therefore multiplying equivalent multiplying and any number multiplied one has the same value the original way start with the fraction when the numerator and denominator are both multiplied the result which has the same value picture this imagine cutting cake into four two the pieces together make half the cake dividing the numerator and denominator fraction the same zero number will also yield equivalent this called reducing simplifying the simple fraction which the numerator and denominator are coprime that the only positive integer that goes into both the numerator and denominator evenly said irreducible lowest simplest for not lowest terms because both and can exactly divided lowest the only positive integer that goes into both and evenly using these can show that common fraction can reduced lowest terms dividing both the numerator and denominator their greatest common divisor for the greatest common divisor and the fraction can reduced lowest terms dividing the numerator and denominator the euclidean algorithm gives method for finding the greatest common divisor any two positive comparing fractions comparing fractions with the same denominator only requires comparing the two positive fractions have the same then the fraction with the smaller denominator the larger when whole divided into equal fewer equal pieces are needed make the then each piece must when two positive fractions have the same they represent the same number but the fraction with the smaller the parts are one way compare fractions with different numerators and denominators find common compare and these are converted and then common denominator and the numerators and can not necessary determine the value the common denominator compare this short cut known cross you can just compare and without computing the multiply top and bottom each fraction the denominator the other get common the denominators are now the but not necessary calculate their value only the numerators need since greater than also note that every negative including negative less than and every positive including positive greater than every negative fraction less than any positive addition the first rule addition that only like quantities can for various quantities unlike such adding thirds must first converted like quantities described imagine pocket containing two and another pocket containing three there are five since four quarters equivalent one this can represented adding unlike quantities add fractions containing unlike quantities quarters and necessary convert all amounts like easy work out the chosen type fraction convert simply multiply together the two denominators bottom each for adding quarters both types fraction are converted thus consider adding the following two first convert into fifteenths multiplying both the numerator and denominator since equals multiplication does not change the value the second convert into fifteenths multiplying both the numerator and denominator now can seen equivalent this method can expressed and for expressions consisting the addition three this method always but sometimes there smaller denominator that can used least common for add and the denominator can used the product and but the smaller denominator may also being the least common multiple and subtraction the process for subtracting fractions the same that adding find common and change each fraction equivalent fraction with the chosen common the resulting fraction will have that and its numerator will the result subtracting the numerators the original for multiplication multiplying fraction another fraction multiply multiply the numerators and multiply the thus why does this first consider one third one using the example three small slices equal size make and four quarters make twelve these equal slices make therefore third quarter now consider the the first two twice large one since one third quarter one two thirds quarter two the second three three times large one two thirds three quarters three times large two thirds one thus two thirds times three quarters six short cut for multiplying fractions called cancellation reduce the answer lowest terms during for two common factor both the numerator the left fraction and the denominator the right and divided out three common factor the left denominator and right numerator and divided out multiplying fraction whole number place the whole number over one and this method works because the fraction means six equal each one which mixed numbers when multiplying mixed best convert the mixed number into improper for other the same making quarters total because cakes each split into quarters makes quarters and quarters since cakes each made quarters division divide fraction whole you may either divide the numerator the goes evenly into the multiply the denominator the for equals and also equals which reduces divide number multiply that number the reciprocal that thus converting between decimals and fractions change common fraction divide the denominator into the round the answer the desired for change divide into obtain change divide into and stop when the desired accuracy note that can written exactly with two decimal while cannot written exactly with any finite number decimal change decimal write the denominator followed many zeroes there are digits the right the decimal and write the numerator all the digits the original omitting the decimal thus converting repeating decimals fractions repeating decimal decimal while arguably more useful work with when performing sometimes lack the precision that common fractions sometimes infinite repeating decimal required reach the same thus often useful convert repeating decimals into the preferred way indicate repeating decimal place bar over the digits that for example for repeating patterns where the repeating pattern begins immediately after the decimal simple division the pattern the same number nines numbers has will for case leading zeros precede the the nines are suffixed the same number trailing zeros case repeating set decimals precede the pattern such can write the sum the repeating and repeating respectively then convert both parts and add them using the methods described fractions abstract mathematics addition being great practical fractions are also studied who check that the rules for fractions given above are consistent and reliable mathematicians define fraction ordered pair integers and for which the operations addition subtraction multiplication and division are defined equivalence relation specified and only these definitions agree every case with the definitions given only the notation more and may elements any integral domain which case fraction element the field fractions for when and are polynomials one the field fractions the field rational fractions also known the field rational functions when and are the field fractions the field rational numbers algebraic fractions algebraic fraction algebraic fraction the indicated quotient two algebraic expressions two examples algebraic fractions are and algebraic fractions are subject the same laws arithmetic the numerator and the denominator are polynomials the algebraic fraction called rational fraction rational expression irrational fraction one that contains the variable under fractional exponent the terminology used describe algebraic fractions similar that used for ordinary for algebraic fraction lowest terms the only factors common the numerator and the denominator are and algebraic fraction whose numerator contain such called complex fraction rational numbers are the quotient field rational expressions are the quotient field the polynomials over some integral domain since coefficient polynomial degree radical expression such rational another example over the the radian measure right the term partial fraction used when decomposing rational expressions into the goal write the rational expression the sum other rational expressions with denominators lesser for the rational expression can rewritten the sum two this useful many areas such integral calculus and differential radical expressions nth root rationalization fraction may also contain radicals the numerator the the denominator contains can helpful rationalize compare simplified form radical expression especially further such adding comparing that fraction are carried also more convenient division done when the denominator monomial square can rationalized multiplying both the top and the bottom the fraction the the process rationalization binomial denominators involves multiplying the top and the bottom fraction the conjugate the denominator that the denominator becomes rational for even this process results the numerator being like the examples the process may still facilitate subsequent manipulations reducing the number irrationals one has work with the typographical variations computer displays and typography simple fractions are sometimes printed single one half see the article number forms for information doing this unicode scientific publishing distinguishes four ways set together with guidelines special fractions that are presented single character with slanted with roughly the same height and width other characters the generally used for simple such and since the numerals are legibility can especially for sized these are not used modern mathematical but other case similar special these are rendered single typographical but with horizontal thus making them upright example would but rendered with the same height other some sources include all rendering fractions case fractions they take only one typographical regardless the direction the shilling called because this notation was used for decimal british currency for half crown meaning two shillings and six while the notation two shillings and six did not represent the forward slash now used especially for fractions inline with prose rather than avoid uneven also used for fractions within fractions complex fractions within exponents increase fractions written this also known piece fractions are written all one typographical but take more typographical built this notation uses two more lines ordinary and results variation spacing between lines when included within other while large and these can particularly for simple fractions within complex history the earliest fractions were reciprocals integers ancient symbols representing one part one part one part and the egyptians used egyptian fractions about years ago egyptians divided with fractions using slightly different they used least common multiples with unit fractions their methods gave the same answer modern the egyptians also had different notation for dyadic fractions the akhmim wooden tablet and several rhind mathematical papyrus problems the greeks used unit fractions and later continued fractions and followers the greek philosopher pythagoras discovered that the square root two cannot expressed jain mathematicians india wrote the sthananga sutra which contains work the theory arithmetical operations with fractions the method putting one number below the other and computing fractions first appeared aryabhatta work around citation needed sanskrit literature fractions rational numbers were always expressed integer followed when the integer written the fraction placed below and itself written two the numerator called amsa part the first the denominator called cheda the second the fraction written without any particular additional one understands that added the integer above marked small circle cross the shape the sign the placed its one understands that subtracted from the for example read bhaskara writes that denote and muslim mathematician from fez morocco specializing islamic inheritance jurisprudence during the first mentions the use fractional where numerators and denominators are separated horizontal his discussion for you are told write fifths and third write this same fractional notation appears soon after the work leonardo fibonacci the discussing the origins decimal fractions dirk jan struik states the introduction decimal fractions common computational practice can dated back the flemish pamphlet thiende published leyden together with french disme the flemish mathematician simon stevin then settled the northern netherlands true that decimal fractions were used the chinese many centuries before stevin and that the persian astronomer used both decimal and sexagesimal fractions with great ease his key arithmetic samarkand early fifteenth while the persian mathematician jamsh claimed have discovered decimal fractions himself the lennart berggren notes that was decimal fractions were first used five centuries before him the baghdadi mathematician abu hasan uqlidisi early the formal education
