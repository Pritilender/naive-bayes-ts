mathematics	functional analysis navigation search functional analysis drum head functional analysis branch mathematical analysis the core which formed the study vector spaces endowed with some kind related structure inner product norm topology etc and the linear operators acting upon these spaces and respecting these structures suitable the historical roots functional analysis lie the study spaces functions and the formulation properties transformations functions such the fourier transform transformations defining continuous unitary etc operators between function this point view turned out particularly useful for the study differential and integral equations the usage the word functional goes back the calculus variations implying function whose argument function and the name was first used hadamard book that however the general concept functional had previously been introduced the italian mathematician and physicist vito volterra the theory nonlinear functionals was continued students particular chet and hadamard also founded the modern school linear functional analysis further developed riesz and the group polish mathematicians around stefan banach modern introductory texts functional the subject seen the study vector spaces endowed with particular infinite dimensional spaces linear algebra deals mostly with finite dimensional and does not use important part functional analysis the extension the theory measure integration and probability infinite dimensional also known infinite dimensional analysis contents normed vector spaces hilbert spaces banach spaces major and foundational results foundations mathematics considerations points view see also references external links normed vector spaces the basic and historically first class spaces studied functional analysis are complete normed vector spaces over the real complex numbers such spaces are called banach spaces important example hilbert space where the norm arises from inner these spaces are fundamental importance many including the mathematical formulation quantum mechanics more functional analysis includes the study chet spaces and other topological vector spaces not endowed with important object study functional analysis are the continuous linear operators defined banach and hilbert these lead naturally the definition algebras and other operator algebras hilbert spaces hilbert spaces can completely there unique hilbert space isomorphism for every cardinality the orthonormal basis finite dimensional hilbert spaces are fully understood linear algebra and dimensional separable hilbert spaces are isomorphic separability being important for functional analysis hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this one the open problems functional analysis prove that every bounded linear operator hilbert space has proper invariant subspace many special cases this invariant subspace problem have already been banach spaces general banach spaces are more complicated than hilbert and cannot classified such simple manner many banach spaces lack notion analogous orthonormal basis examples banach spaces are spaces for any real number given also measure set then sometimes also denoted has its vectors equivalence classes measurable functions whose absolute value power has finite that functions for which one has the counting measure then the integral may replaced that require then not necessary deal with equivalence and the space denoted written more simply the case when the set negative integers banach large part the study involves the dual space the space all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying called banach space can canonically identified with subspace its which the dual its dual the corresponding map isometry but general not general banach space and its bidual need not even isometrically isomorphic any contrary the dimensional this explained the dual space also the notion derivative can extended arbitrary functions between banach see for the chet derivative article major and foundational results important results functional analysis the uniform boundedness principle also known banach steinhaus theorem applies sets operators with uniform one the spectral theorems there indeed more than gives integral formula for the normal operators hilbert this theorem central importance for the mathematical formulation quantum mechanics the hahn banach theorem extends functionals from subspace the full preserving implication the triviality dual the open mapping theorem and closed graph theorem see also list functional analysis topics foundations mathematics considerations most spaces considered functional analysis have infinite show the existence vector space basis for such spaces may require zorn lemma however somewhat different schauder basis usually more relevant functional many very important theorems require the hahn banach theorem usually proved using axiom choice although the strictly weaker boolean prime ideal theorem suffices the baire category theorem needed prove many important also requires form axiom points view functional analysis its present form includes the following abstract analysis approach analysis based topological groups topological rings and topological vector spaces geometry banach spaces contains many one combinatorial approach connected with jean bourgain another characterization banach spaces which various forms the law large numbers hold noncommutative geometry developed alain connes partly building earlier such george mackey approach ergodic theory
