general topology set topology navigation search sine curve general topology the branch topology that deals with the basic set theoretic definitions and constructions used the foundation most other branches including differential topology geometric topology and algebraic topology another name for general topology point set topology the fundamental concepts set topology are continuity compactness and connectedness continuous functions intuitively take nearby points nearby compact sets are those that can covered finitely many sets arbitrarily small connected sets are sets that cannot divided into two pieces that are far the words arbitrarily and far can all made precise using open sets described change the definition open change what continuous compact and connected sets each choice definition for open called topology set with topology called topological space metric spaces are important class topological spaces where distances can assigned number called metric having metric simplifies many and many the most common topological spaces are metric contents topology set basis for topology subspace and quotient examples topological spaces continuous functions alternative definitions neighborhood definition sequences and nets closure operator definition properties homeomorphisms defining topologies via continuous functions compact sets connected sets connected components disconnected spaces path connected sets products spaces separation axioms countability axioms metric spaces baire category theory main areas research continuum theory pointless topology dimension theory topological algebras metrizability theory foundations topology set theoretic topology history see also references further reading topology set topological space let set and let family subsets then called topology both the empty set and are elements any union elements element any intersection finitely many elements element topology then the pair called topological space the notation may used denote set endowed with the particular topology the members are called open sets subset said closed its complement its complement subset may closed both clopen set the empty set and itself are always both closed and basis for topology basis base basis for topological space with topology collection open sets such that every open set can written union elements say that the base generates the topology bases are useful because many properties topologies can reduced statements about base that generates that and because many topologies are most easily defined terms base that generates subspace and quotient every subset topological space can given the subspace topology which the open sets are the intersections the open sets the larger space with the for any indexed family topological the product can given the product topology which generated the inverse images open sets the factors under the projection mappings for finite basis for the product topology consists all products open for infinite there the additional requirement that basic open all but finitely many its projections are the entire quotient space defined topological space and and surjective function then the quotient topology the collection subsets that have open inverse images under other the quotient topology the finest topology for which common example quotient topology when equivalence relation defined the topological space the map then the natural projection onto the set equivalence classes examples topological spaces given set may have many different set given different viewed different topological any set can given the discrete topology which every subset the only convergent sequences nets this topology are those that are eventually also any set can given the trivial topology also called the indiscrete which only the empty set and the whole space are every sequence and net this topology converges every point the this example shows that general topological limits sequences need not however often topological spaces must hausdorff spaces where limit points are there are many ways define topology the set real numbers the standard topology generated the open intervals the set all open intervals forms base basis for the meaning that every open set union some collection sets from the this means that set open there exists open interval non zero radius about every point the more the euclidean spaces can given the usual topology the basic open sets are the open balls similarly the set complex numbers and have standard topology which the basic open sets are open every metric space can given metric which the basic open sets are open balls defined the this the standard topology any normed vector space dimensional vector space this topology the same for all many sets linear operators functional analysis are endowed with topologies that are defined specifying when particular sequence functions converges the zero any local field has topology native and this can extended vector spaces over that every manifold has natural topology since locally similarly every simplex and every simplicial complex inherits natural topology from the zariski topology defined algebraically the spectrum ring algebraic variety the closed sets the zariski topology are the solution sets systems polynomial equations linear graph has natural topology that generalises many the geometric aspects graphs with vertices and edges the sierpi ski space the simplest discrete topological has important relations the theory computation and there exist numerous topologies any given finite set such spaces are called finite topological spaces finite spaces are sometimes used provide examples counterexamples conjectures about topological spaces any set can given the cofinite topology which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement this the smallest topology any infinite any set can given the cocountable topology which set defined open either empty its complement when the set this topology serves counterexample many the real line can also given the lower limit topology here the basic open sets are the half open intervals this topology strictly finer than the euclidean topology defined sequence converges point this topology and only converges from above the euclidean this example shows that set may have many distinct topologies defined ordinal number then the set may endowed with the order topology generated the intervals and where and are elements continuous functions continuous function continuity expressed terms neighborhoods continuous some point and only for any neighborhood there neighborhood such that intuitively continuity means matter how small becomes there always containing that maps inside and whose image under contains this equivalent the condition that the preimages the open sets are open metric this definition equivalent the definition that often used extreme set given the discrete topology all functions any topological space are the other equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set least then the only continuous functions are the constant conversely any function whose range indiscrete alternative definitions several equivalent definitions for topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways define continuous neighborhood definition definitions based preimages are often difficult use the following criterion expresses continuity terms neighborhoods continuous some point and only for any neighborhood there neighborhood such that intuitively continuity means matter how small becomes there always containing that maps inside and are metric equivalent consider the neighborhood system open balls centered and instead all this gives back the above definition continuity the context metric however general topological there notion nearness note however that the target space hausdorff still true that continuous and only the limit approaches isolated every function sequences and nets several the topology space conveniently specified terms limit points many this accomplished specifying when point the limit sequence but for some spaces that are too large some one specifies also when point the limit more general sets points indexed directed set known nets function continuous only takes limits sequences limits the former preservation limits also the function may preserve all limits sequences yet still fail and preservation nets necessary and sufficient function sequentially continuous whenever sequence converges limit the sequence converges thus sequentially continuous functions preserve sequential every continuous function sequentially first countable space and countable choice holds then the converse also any function preserving sequential limits metric sequential continuity and continuity are for non countable sequential continuity might strictly weaker than the spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces this motivates the consideration nets instead sequences general topological continuous functions preserve limits and fact this property characterizes continuous closure operator definition instead specifying the open subsets topological the topology can also determined closure operator denoted which assigns any subset its closure interior operator denoted which assigns any subset its interior these function between topological spaces continuous the sense above and only for all subsets that given any element that the closure any subset belongs the closure this equivalent the requirement that for all subsets moreover continuous and only for any subset properties and are then the composition continuous and compact then connected then path connected then lindel then separable then the possible topologies fixed set are partially ordered topology said coarser than another topology every open subset with respect also open with respect then the identity map continuous and only see also comparison topologies more continuous function stays continuous the topology replaced coarser topology and replaced finer topology homeomorphisms symmetric the concept continuous map open map for which images open sets are open map has inverse function that inverse and continuous map has that inverse given bijective function between two topological the inverse function need not bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function called homeomorphism continuous bijection has its domain compact space and its codomain hausdorff then defining topologies via continuous functions given function where topological space and set without specified the final topology defined letting the open sets those subsets for which open has existing continuous with respect this topology and only the existing topology coarser than the final topology thus the final topology can characterized the finest topology that makes continuous surjective this topology canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined dually for function from set topological the initial topology has open subsets those subsets for which open has existing continuous with respect this topology and only the existing topology finer than the initial topology thus the initial topology can characterized the coarsest topology that makes continuous this topology canonically identified with the subspace topology viewed subset more given set specifying the set continuous functions into all topological spaces defines dually similar idea can applied maps this instance universal property compact sets compact formally topological space called compact each its open covers has finite subcover otherwise called non compact explicitly this means that for every arbitrary collection open subsets such that there finite subset such that some branches mathematics such algebraic geometry typically influenced the french school bourbaki use the term quasi compact for the general and reserve the term compact for topological spaces that are both hausdorff and quasi compact compact set sometimes referred compactum plural compacta every closed interval finite length compact more set compact and only closed and see heine borel theorem every continuous image compact space compact subset hausdorff space every continuous bijection from compact space hausdorff space necessarily homeomorphism every sequence points compact metric space has convergent every compact dimensional manifold can embedded some euclidean space connected sets connected space topological space said disconnected the union two disjoint nonempty open sets otherwise said connected subset topological space said connected connected under its subspace topology some authors exclude the empty set with its unique connected but this article does not follow that for topological space the following conditions are cannot divided into two disjoint nonempty closed sets the only subsets that are both open and closed clopen sets are and the empty the only subsets with empty boundary are and the empty cannot written the union two nonempty separated sets the only continuous functions from the point space endowed with the discrete are every interval connected the continuous image connected space connected components the maximal connected subsets ordered inclusion nonempty topological space are called the connected components the the components any topological space form partition they are disjoint nonempty and their union the whole every component closed subset the original follows the case where their number each component also open however their number this might not the for the connected components the set the rational numbers are the point which are not let the connected component topological space and the intersection all closed sets containing called quasi component then where the equality holds compact hausdorff locally disconnected spaces space which all components are point sets called totally disconnected related this space called totally separated for any two distinct elements and there exist disjoint open neighborhoods and such that the union and clearly any totally separated space totally but the converse does not for example take two copies the rational numbers and identify them every point except the resulting with the quotient totally however considering the two copies one sees that the space not totally not even hausdorff and the condition being totally separated strictly stronger than the condition being path connected sets path from point point topological space continuous function from the unit interval with and path component equivalence class under the equivalence relation which makes equivalent there path from the space said path connected pathwise connected connected there most one there path joining any two points again many authors exclude the empty every connected space the converse not always examples connected spaces that are not connected include the extended long line and the topologist sine curve however subsets the real line are connected and only they are these subsets are the intervals also open subsets are connected and only they are additionally connectedness and connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces products spaces product topology given such that the cartesian product the topological spaces indexed and the canonical projections the product topology defined the coarsest topology the topology with the fewest open for which all the projections are continuous the product topology sometimes called the tychonoff topology the open sets the product topology are unions finite sets the form where each open and only finitely many for finite product for the product two topological the products base elements the gives basis for the product the product topology the topology generated sets the form where and open subset other the sets form subbase for the topology subset open and only possibly union intersections finitely many sets the form the are sometimes called open cylinders and their intersections are cylinder sets the product the topologies each forms basis for what called the box topology the box topology finer than the product but for finite products they related compactness tychonoff theorem the product compact spaces separation axioms separation axiom many these names have alternative meanings some mathematical explained history the separation axioms for the meanings normal and are sometimes similarly regular and etc many the concepts also have several however the one listed first always least likely most these axioms have alternative definitions with the same the definitions given here fall into consistent pattern that relates the various notions separation defined the previous other possible definitions can found the individual all the following again topological space kolmogorov any two distinct points are topologically distinguishable common theme among the separation axioms have one version axiom that requires and one version that accessible chet any two distinct points are thus and only both and though you may say such things space chet topology and suppose that the topological space chet avoid saying chet space this since there another entirely different notion chet space functional analysis hausdorff separated any two distinct points are separated thus hausdorff and only both and hausdorff space must also urysohn any two distinct points are separated closed space must also regular and given any point and closed set such that does not belong they are separated regular any such and also separated closed tychonoff completely completely regular and given any point and closed set such that does not belong they are separated continuous normal hausdorff and any two disjoint closed subsets are separated space normal and only any two disjoint closed sets can separated continuous this urysohn lemma completely normal completely and any two separated sets are separated completely normal space must also perfectly normal perfectly and any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated continuous perfectly normal hausdorff space must also completely normal the tietze extension theorem normal every continuous valued function defined closed subspace can extended continuous map defined the whole countability axioms axiom countability axiom countability property certain mathematical objects usually category that requires the existence countable set with certain while without such sets might not important countability axioms for topological spaces sequential space set open every sequence convergent point the set eventually the set countable space every point has countable neighbourhood basis local second countable space the topology has countable base separable space there exists countable dense subspace space every open cover has countable subcover compact space there exists countable cover compact spaces every first countable space every countable space separable and every compact space metric space for metric spaces separability and the property are all metric spaces metric space metric space ordered pair where set and metric function such that for any the following non negative iff identity indiscernibles symmetry and triangle inequality the function also called distance function simply distance often omitted and one just writes for metric space clear from the context what metric every metric space paracompact and hausdorff and thus normal the metrization theorems provide necessary and sufficient conditions for topology come from baire category theory baire category theorem the baire category theorem says complete metric space locally compact hausdorff then the interior every union countably many nowhere dense sets any open subspace baire space itself baire main areas research continuum theory general topology continuum
