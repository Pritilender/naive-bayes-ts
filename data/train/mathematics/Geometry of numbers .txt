geometry numbers navigation search number theory the geometry numbers studies convex bodies and integer vectors dimensional space the geometry numbers was initiated hermann minkowski the geometry numbers has close relationship with other fields especially functional analysis and diophantine approximation the problem finding rational numbers that approximate irrational quantity contents minkowski results later research the geometry numbers subspace theorem schmidt influence functional analysis references bibliography results minkowski theorem suppose that lattice dimensional euclidean space and convex centrally symmetric minkowski theorem sometimes called first states that then contains nonzero vector minkowski second theorem the successive minimum defined the inf the numbers such that contains linearly independent vectors minkowski theorem successive minima sometimes called minkowski second theorem strengthening his first theorem and states that later research the geometry numbers research the geometry numbers was conducted many number theorists including louis mordell harold davenport and carl ludwig siegel recent lenstra brion and barvinok have developed combinatorial theories that enumerate the lattice points some convex subspace theorem schmidt subspace theorem lemma volume determinant parallelepiped the geometry the subspace theorem was obtained wolfgang schmidt states that are linearly independent linear forms variables with algebraic coefficients and any given real then the zero integer points with lie finite number proper subspaces influence functional analysis normed vector space banach space space geometry numbers had profound influence functional analysis minkowski proved that symmetric convex bodies induce norms dimensional vector minkowski theorem was generalized topological vector spaces kolmogorov whose theorem states that the symmetric convex sets that are closed and bounded generate the topology banach space researchers continue study generalizations star shaped sets and other non convex sets
