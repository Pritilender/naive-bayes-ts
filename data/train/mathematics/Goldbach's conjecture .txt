goldbach conjecture navigation search weak conjecture conjecture one the oldest and known unsolved problems number theory and all mathematics even integer primes the conjecture has been shown hold through and generally assumed but remains unproven despite considerable contents goldbach number origins verified results heuristic justification rigorous results similar questions references further reading external links goldbach number goldbach number even positive integer that can expressed the sum two therefore another statement conjecture that all even integers greater than equal are goldbach the expression given even number sum two primes called goldbach partition that the following are examples goldbach partitions for some even the number unordered ways which can written the sum two primes for starting origins june the german mathematician christian goldbach wrote letter leonhard euler letter which proposed the following then proposed second conjecture the margin his considered prime number convention subsequently the two conjectures are now known but this did not seem issue the modern version marginal conjecture every integer greater than can written the sum three primes euler replied letter dated june and reminded goldbach earlier conversation they had vormals mit mir communicirt which goldbach remarked his original and not conjecture followed from the following statement every even integer greater than can written the sum two primes which thus also conjecture the letter dated june euler dass ein jeder numerus par eine summa duorum primorum halte ich ein ganz gewisses ungeachtet ich dasselbe nicht demonstriren every even integer sum two regard this completely certain although cannot prove goldbach third version equivalent the two other the form which the conjecture usually expressed also known the strong even binary goldbach distinguish from weaker the strong goldbach conjecture implies the conjecture that all odd numbers greater than are the sum three odd primes which known today variously the weak goldbach conjecture the odd goldbach the ternary goldbach while the weak goldbach conjecture appears have been finally proved the strong conjecture has remained the strong goldbach conjecture the weak goldbach conjecture will true verified results for small values the strong goldbach conjecture and hence the weak goldbach can verified for nils pipping laboriously verified the conjecture with the advent many more values have been oliveira silva running distributed computer search that has verified the conjecture for and checked one record from this search that the smallest number which has goldbach partition with prime below heuristic justification statistical considerations which focus the probabilistic distribution prime numbers present informal evidence favour the conjecture both the weak and strong for sufficiently large integers the greater the the more ways there are available for that number represented the sum two three other and the more likely becomes that least one these representations consists entirely oeis very crude version the heuristic probabilistic argument for the strong form the goldbach the prime number theorem asserts that integer selected random has roughly chance being thus large even integer and number between and then one might expect the probability and simultaneously being prime one pursues this one might expect the total number ways write large even integer the sum two odd primes roughly since this quantity goes infinity increases expect that every large even integer has not just one representation the sum two but fact has very many such this heuristic argument actually somewhat because assumes that the events and being prime are statistically independent each for odd then also and then trivial relation besides the number only odd numbers can similarly divisible and was already prime distinct from then would also coprime and thus slightly more likely prime than general pursuing this type analysis more hardy and littlewood conjectured part their famous hardy littlewood prime tuple conjecture that for any fixed the number representations large integer the sum primes with should asymptotically equal where the product over all primes and the number solutions the equation modular arithmetic subject the constraints this formula has been rigorously proven asymptotically valid for from the work vinogradov but still only conjecture when the latter the above formula simplifies when and when where the twin prime constant this sometimes known the extended goldbach conjecture the strong goldbach conjecture fact very similar the twin prime conjecture and the two conjectures are believed roughly comparable the goldbach partition functions shown here can displayed histograms which informatively illustrate the above see goldbach comet rigorous results the strong goldbach conjecture much more using vinogradov chudakov van der corput and estermann showed that almost all even numbers can written the sum two primes the sense that the fraction even numbers which can written tends towards lev schnirelmann proved that any natural number greater than can written the sum not more than prime numbers where effectively computable see schnirelmann density schnirelmann constant the lowest number with this schnirelmann himself obtained this result was subsequently enhanced many currently the best known result due olivier who showed that every even number fact the sum most six resolving the weak goldbach conjecture will also directly imply that every even number the sum most four chen jingrun showed using the methods sieve theory that every sufficiently large even number can written the sum either two prime and semiprime the product two see chen theorem hugh montgomery and robert charles vaughan showed that most even numbers were expressible the sum two more they showed that there existed positive constants and such that for all sufficiently large numbers every even number less than the sum two with most exceptions the set even integers which are not the sum two primes has density zero linnik proved the existence constant such that every sufficiently large even number the sum two primes and most powers roger brown and jan christoph puchta found that works this was improved pintz and ruzsa with many famous conjectures there are number purported proofs the goldbach none accepted the mathematical considerable work has been done goldbach weak conjecture culminating claim harald helfgott fully prove the conjecture for all odd integers greater than rather than the much larger that was implied previous similar questions one can pose similar questions when primes are replaced other special sets such the was proven lagrange that every positive integer the sum four squares see waring problem and the related waring goldbach problem sums powers hardy and littlewood listed their conjecture every large odd number the sum prime and the double prime mathematics magazine this conjecture known lemoine conjecture also called levy conjecture the goldbach conjecture for practical numbers like sequence was stated margenstern and proved melfi every even number sum two practical
