subareas related areas mathematics generalizations prominent graph theorists notes references external links online textbooks other resources definitions definitions graph theory the following are some the more basic ways defining graphs and related mathematical graph the most common sense the graph ordered pair comprising set vertices nodes together with set edges lines which are element subsets edge related with two and the relation represented unordered pair the vertices with respect the particular avoid this type graph may described precisely undirected and simple other senses graph stem from different conceptions the edge one more generalized set together with relation incidence that associates with each edge two another generalized multiset unordered pairs not necessarily vertices many authors call this type object multigraph all these variants and others are described more fully the vertices belonging edge are called the ends endpoints end vertices the vertex may exist graph and not belong and are usually taken and many the known results are not true are rather for infinite graphs because many the arguments fail the infinite case the order graph the number size the number the degree vertex the number edges that connect where edge that connects the vertex both ends loop counted for edge graph theorists usually use the somewhat shorter notation applications graphs can used model many types relations and processes biological social and information many practical problems can represented computer science graphs are used represent networks data computational the flow etc for the link structure website can represented directed which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page similar approach can taken problems biology computer chip and many other the development algorithms handle graphs therefore major interest computer the transformation graphs often formalized and represented graph rewrite systems complementary graph transformation systems focusing based memory manipulation graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction persistent storing and querying graph structured data graph theoretic various have proven particularly useful linguistics since natural language often lends itself well discrete traditionally syntax and compositional semantics follow based whose expressive power lies the principle compositionality modeled hierarchical more contemporary approaches such head driven phrase structure grammar model the syntax natural language using typed feature structures which are directed acyclic graphs within lexical semantics especially applied modeling word meaning easier when given word understood terms related semantic networks are therefore important computational linguistics still other methods phonology optimality theory which uses lattice graphs and morphology finite state using finite state transducers are common the analysis language indeed the usefulness this area mathematics linguistics has borne organizations such textgraphs well various projects such wordnet verbnet and graph theory also used study molecules chemistry and physics condensed matter physics the dimensional structure complicated simulated atomic structures can studied quantitatively gathering statistics theoretic properties related the topology the chemistry graph makes natural model for where vertices represent atoms and edges bonds this approach especially used computer processing molecular ranging from chemical editors database statistical graphs can represent local connections between interacting parts well the dynamics physical process such graphs are also used represent the scale channels porous media which the vertices represent the pores and the edges represent the smaller channels connecting the graph theory also widely used sociology for measure prestige explore rumor spreading notably through the use social network analysis software under the umbrella social networks are many different types acquaintanceship and friendship graphs describe whether people know each influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior finally collaboration graphs model whether two people work together particular such acting movie likewise graph theory useful biology and conservation efforts where vertex can represent regions where certain species exist and the edges represent migration movement between the this information important when looking breeding patterns tracking the spread parasites how changes the movement can affect other graphs are useful geometry and certain parts topology such knot theory algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory graph structure can extended assigning weight each edge the graphs with weighted graphs are used represent structures which pairwise connections have some numerical for example graph represents road the weights could represent the length each history the paper written leonhard euler the seven bridges nigsberg and published regarded the first paper the history graph this well the one written vandermonde the knight problem carried with the analysis situs initiated leibniz euler formula relating the number vertices and faces convex polyhedron was studied and generalized cauchy and huillier and the origin topology more than one century after paper the bridges nigsberg and while listing introduced cayley was led the study particular analytical forms arising from differential calculus study particular class the trees this study had many implications theoretical chemistry the involved techniques mainly concerned the enumeration graphs having particular enumerative graph theory then rose from the results cayley and the fundamental results published lya between and and the generalization these bruijn cayley linked his results trees with the contemporary studies chemical the fusion the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry the origin part the standard terminology graph the term graph was introduced sylvester paper published nature where draws analogy between quantic and algebra and molecular graph graph the first textbook graph theory was written nes nig and published another book frank harary published was considered the world over the definitive textbook the and enabled chemists electrical engineers and social scientists talk each harary donated all the royalties fund the lya prize one the most famous and stimulating problems graph theory the four color problem true that any map drawn the plane may have its regions colored with four such way that any two regions having common border have different this problem was first posed francis guthrie and its first written record letter morgan addressed hamilton the same many incorrect proofs have been including those kempe and the study and the generalization this problem tait heawood ramsey and hadwiger led the study the colorings the graphs embedded surfaces with arbitrary genus tait reformulation generated new class the factorization problems particularly studied petersen and nig the works ramsey colorations and more specially the results obtained tur was the origin another branch graph extremal graph theory the four color problem remained unsolved for more than heinrich heesch published method for solving the problem using aided proof produced kenneth appel and wolfgang haken makes fundamental use the notion discharging developed the proof involved checking the properties configurations and was not fully accepted the time due its simpler proof considering only configurations was given twenty years later robertson seymour sanders and thomas the autonomous development topology from and fertilized graph theory back through the works jordan kuratowski and whitney another important factor common development graph theory and topology came from the use the techniques modern the first example such use comes from the work the physicist gustav kirchhoff who published his kirchhoff circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current electric circuits the introduction probabilistic methods graph especially the study erd and nyi the asymptotic probability graph gave rise yet another known random graph theory which has been fruitful source theoretic drawing graphs graph drawing graphs are represented visually drawing dot circle for every and drawing arc between two vertices they are connected the graph the direction indicated drawing graph drawing should not confused with the graph itself the non visual there are several ways structure the graph all that matters which vertices are connected which others how many edges and not the exact practice often difficult decide two drawings represent the same depending the problem domain some layouts may better suited and easier understand than the pioneering work tutte was very influential the subject graph among other introduced the use linear algebraic methods obtain graph graph drawing also can said encompass problems that deal with the crossing number and its various the crossing number graph the minimum number intersections between edges that drawing the graph the plane must for planar the crossing number zero drawings surfaces other than the plane are also graph theoretic data structures graph data there are different ways store graphs computer the data structure used depends both the graph structure and the algorithm used for manipulating the theoretically one can distinguish between list and matrix structures but concrete applications the best structure often combination list structures are often preferred for sparse graphs they have smaller memory matrix structures the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can consume huge amounts list structures include the incidence list array pairs and the adjacency list which separately lists the neighbors each much like the incidence each vertex has list which vertices adjacent matrix structures include the incidence matrix matrix and whose rows represent vertices and whose columns represent and the adjacency matrix which both the rows and columns are indexed both cases indicates two adjacent objects and indicates two adjacent the laplacian matrix modified form the adjacency matrix that incorporates information about the degrees the and useful some calculations such kirchhoff theorem the number spanning trees the distance matrix like the adjacency has both its rows and columns indexed but rather than containing each cell contains the length shortest path between two problems graph theory enumeration there large literature graphical enumeration the problem counting graphs meeting specified some this work found harary and palmer subgraphs induced and minors common called the subgraph isomorphism problem finding fixed graph subgraph given one reason interested such question that many graph properties are hereditary for which means that graph has the property and only all subgraphs have unfortunately finding maximal subgraphs certain kind often complete problem finding the largest complete graph called the clique problem similar problem finding induced subgraphs given again some important graph properties are hereditary with respect induced which means that graph has property and only all induced subgraphs also have finding maximal induced subgraphs certain kind also often for finding the largest edgeless induced independent set called the independent set problem still another such the minor containment problem find fixed graph minor given minor subcontraction graph any graph obtained taking subgraph and contracting some edges many graph properties are hereditary for which means that graph has property and only all minors have famous graph planar contains minor neither the complete bipartite graph see the three cottage problem nor the complete graph another class problems has with the extent which various species and generalizations graphs are determined their point deleted subgraphs for the reconstruction conjecture graph coloring many problems have with various ways coloring graphs for the four color theorem the strong perfect graph theorem the erd conjecture the total coloring conjecture also called behzad the list coloring conjecture the hadwiger conjecture graph subsumption and unification constraint modeling theories concern families directed graphs related partial order these graphs are ordered meaning that more constrained which are more specific and thus contain greater amount are subsumed those that are more operations between graphs include evaluating the direction subsumption relationship between two and computing graph the unification two argument graphs defined the most general graph the computation that consistent with contains all the information the such graph efficient unification algorithms are for constraint frameworks which are strictly compositional graph unification the sufficient satisfiability and combination well known applications include automatic theorem proving and modeling the elaboration
