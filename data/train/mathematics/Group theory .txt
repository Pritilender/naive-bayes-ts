the concept group central abstract other known algebraic such rings fields and vector spaces can all seen groups endowed with additional operations and axioms groups recur throughout and the methods group theory have influenced many parts linear algebraic groups and lie groups are two branches group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas their own various physical such crystals and the hydrogen atom can modelled symmetry groups thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications physics chemistry and materials science group theory also central public key cryptography one the most important mathematical achievements the century was the collaborative taking more than journal pages and mostly published between and that culminated complete classification finite simple groups contents history main classes groups permutation groups matrix groups transformation groups abstract groups topological and algebraic groups combinatorial and geometric group theory representation groups connection groups and symmetry applications group theory see also notes references external links history history group theory group theory has three main historical number theory the theory algebraic equations and geometry the theoretic strand was begun leonhard euler and developed gauss work modular arithmetic and additive and multiplicative groups related quadratic fields early results about permutation groups were obtained lagrange ruffini and abel their quest for general solutions polynomial equations high variste galois coined the term group and established now known galois theory between the nascent theory groups and field theory groups first became important projective geometry and later non euclidean geometry felix klein erlangen program proclaimed group theory the organizing principle galois the was the first employ groups determine the solvability polynomial equations arthur cayley and augustin louis cauchy pushed these investigations further creating the theory permutation groups the second historical source for groups stems from geometrical situations attempt come grips with possible geometries such euclidean hyperbolic projective geometry using group felix klein initiated the erlangen programme sophus lie started using groups now called lie groups attached analytic problems thirdly groups first implicitly and later used algebraic number theory the different scope these early sources resulted different notions the theory groups was unified starting around since the impact group theory has been ever giving rise the birth abstract algebra the early representation theory and many more influential off the classification finite simple groups vast body work from the mid classifying all the finite simple groups main classes groups group glossary group theory the range groups being considered has gradually expanded from finite permutation groups and special examples matrix groups abstract groups that may specified through presentation generators and permutation groups the first class groups undergo systematic study was permutation groups given any set and collection bijections into itself known permutations that closed under compositions and group acting consists elements and consists all permutations the symmetric group any permutation group subgroup the symmetric group early construction due cayley exhibited any group permutation acting itself means the left regular representation many the structure permutation group can studied using the properties its action the corresponding for this way one proves that for the alternating group simple does not admit any proper normal subgroups this fact plays key role the impossibility solving general algebraic equation degree radicals matrix groups the next important class groups given matrix groups linear groups here set consisting invertible matrices given order over field that closed under the products and such group acts the dimensional vector space linear transformations this action makes matrix groups conceptually similar permutation and the geometry the action may usefully exploited establish properties the group transformation groups permutation groups and matrix groups are special cases transformation groups groups that act certain space preserving its inherent the case permutation for matrix vector space the concept transformation group closely related with the concept symmetry group transformation groups frequently consist all transformations that preserve certain the theory transformation groups forms bridge connecting group theory with differential geometry long line originating with lie and klein considers group actions manifolds homeomorphisms diffeomorphisms the groups themselves may discrete continuous abstract groups most groups considered the first stage the development group theory were concrete having been realized through permutations was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea abstract group set with operations satisfying certain system axioms began take typical way specifying abstract group through presentation generators and relations significant source abstract groups given the construction factor group quotient group group normal subgroup class groups algebraic number fields were among the earliest examples factor much interest number theory group permutation group set the factor group longer acting but the idea abstract group permits one not worry about this the change perspective from concrete abstract groups makes natural consider properties groups that are independent particular modern invariant under isomorphism well the classes group with given such finite groups periodic groups simple groups solvable groups and rather than exploring properties individual one seeks establish results that apply whole class the new paradigm was paramount importance for the development foreshadowed the creation abstract algebra the works hilbert emil artin emmy noether and mathematicians their citation needed topological and algebraic groups important elaboration the concept group occurs endowed with additional notably topological space differentiable manifold algebraic variety the group operations and are compatible with this are continuous smooth regular the sense algebraic maps then becomes topological group lie group algebraic group the presence extra structure relates these types groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available their topological groups form natural domain for abstract harmonic analysis whereas lie groups frequently realized transformation are the mainstays differential geometry and unitary representation theory certain classification questions that cannot solved general can approached and resolved for special subclasses thus compact connected lie groups have been completely there fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological whenever group can realized lattice topological group the geometry and analysis pertaining yield important results about comparatively recent trend the theory finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups profinite groups for single adic analytic group has family quotients which are finite groups various and properties translate into the properties its finite combinatorial and geometric group theory groups can described different finite groups can described writing down the group table consisting all possible multiplications more compact way defining group generators and relations also called the presentation given any set generators the free group generated subjects onto the group the kernel this map called subgroup generated some subset the presentation usually denoted for the group can generated one element equal and because never equals unless string consisting generator symbols and their inverses called word combinatorial group theory studies groups from the perspective generators and particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are for example finitely generated finitely presented groups addition the relations are the area makes use the connection graphs via their fundamental groups for one can show that every subgroup free group there are several natural questions arising from giving group its the word problem asks whether two words are effectively the same group relating the problem turing machines one can show that there general algorithm solving this another generally algorithmically insoluble problem the group isomorphism problem which asks whether two groups given different presentations are actually for example the additive group integers can also presented xyxyx may not obvious that these groups are geometric group theory attacks these problems from geometric either viewing groups geometric finding suitable geometric objects group acts the first idea made precise means the cayley graph whose vertices correspond group elements and edges correspond right multiplication the given two one constructs the word metric given the length the minimal path between the theorem milnor and svarc then says that given group acting reasonable manner metric space for example compact manifold then quasi isometric looks similar from the the space representation groups saying that group acts set means that every element defines bijective map set way compatible with the group when has more useful restrict this notion representation vector space group homomorphism where consists the invertible linear transformations other every group element assigned automorphism such that for any this definition can understood two both which give rise whole new domains the one may yield new information about the group often the group operation abstractly but via corresponds the multiplication matrices which very the other given understood group acting complicated this simplifies the study the object for known that above decomposes into irreducible parts these parts turn are much more easily manageable than the whole via schur lemma given group representation theory then asks what representations exist there are several and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different every representation theory finite groups and representations lie groups are two main subdomains the the totality representations governed the characters for fourier polynomials can interpreted the characters the group complex numbers absolute value acting the space periodic connection groups and symmetry symmetry group given structured object any symmetry mapping the object onto itself which preserves the this occurs many for example set with additional symmetry bijective map from the set giving rise permutation groups the object set points the plane with its metric structure any other metric space symmetry bijection the set itself which preserves the distance between each pair points isometry the corresponding group called isometry group instead angles are one speaks conformal maps conformal maps give rise kleinian groups for symmetries are not restricted geometrical but include algebraic objects for the equation galois group the axioms group formalize the essential aspects symmetry symmetries form they are closed because you take symmetry and then apply another the result will still the identity keeping the object fixed always symmetry existence inverses guaranteed undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions and composition functions are frucht theorem says that every group the symmetry group some graph every abstract group actually the symmetries some explicit the saying preserving the object can made precise working category maps preserving the structure are then the morphisms and the symmetry group the automorphism group the object applications group theory applications group theory almost all structures abstract algebra are special cases rings for can viewed abelian groups corresponding together with second operation corresponding therefore group theoretic arguments underlie large parts the theory those galois theory uses groups describe the symmetries the roots polynomial more precisely the automorphisms the algebras generated these the fundamental theorem galois theory provides link between algebraic field extensions and group gives effective criterion for the solvability polynomial equations terms the solvability the corresponding galois group for the symmetric group elements not solvable which implies that the general quintic equation cannot solved radicals the way equations lower degree the being one the historical roots group still fruitfully applied yield new results areas such class field theory algebraic topology another domain which prominently associates groups the objects the theory interested there groups are used describe certain invariants topological spaces they are called invariants because they are defined such way that they not change the space subjected some deformation for the fundamental group counts how many paths the space are essentially the poincar conjecture proved grigori perelman prominent application this the influence not though for algebraic topology makes use eilenberg maclane spaces which are spaces with prescribed homotopy groups similarly algebraic theory stakes crucial way classifying spaces finally the name the torsion subgroup infinite group shows the legacy topology group upper half plane cyclic group cipher algebraic geometry and cryptography likewise uses group theory many abelian varieties have been introduced the presence the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly they also often serve test for new the dimensional namely elliptic curves studied particular they are both theoretically and practically very large groups prime order constructed elliptic curve cryptography serve for public key cryptography cryptographical methods this kind benefit from the flexibility the geometric hence their group together with the complicated structure these which make the discrete logarithm very hard one the earliest encryption caesar cipher may also interpreted very group another toric varieties are algebraic varieties acted torus toroidal embeddings have recently led advances algebraic geometry particular resolution singularities algebraic number theory special case group thereby following the rules the for euler product formula captures the fact that any integer decomposes unique way into primes the failure this statement for more general rings gives rise class groups and regular primes which feature kummer treatment fermat last theorem the concept the lie group named after mathematician sophus lie important the study differential equations and manifolds they describe the symmetries continuous geometric and analytical analysis these and other groups called harmonic analysis haar measures that integrals invariant under the translation lie are used for pattern recognition and other image processing techniques combinatorics the notion permutation group and the concept group action are often used simplify the counting set see particular burnside lemma the presence the periodicity the circle fifths yields applications elementary group theory musical set theory physics groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws physics seem according noether theorem every continuous symmetry physical system corresponds conservation law the physicists are very interested group especially lie since these representations often point the way the possible physical examples the use groups physics include the standard model gauge theory the lorentz group and the poincar group chemistry and materials science groups are used classify crystal structures regular and the symmetries molecules the assigned point groups can then used determine physical properties such polarity and chirality spectroscopic properties particularly useful for raman spectroscopy and
