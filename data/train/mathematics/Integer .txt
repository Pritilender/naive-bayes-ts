known whole number that can written without fractional component for and are while and are the set integers consists zero the natural numbers and their inverse negatives this often denoted boldface blackboard bold unicode standing for the german word zahlen numbers subset the sets rational and real numbers like the natural countably infinite the integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural algebraic number theory the integers are sometimes called rational integers distinguish them from the more general algebraic integers the integers are the algebraic integers that are also rational numbers contents algebraic properties order theoretic properties construction integers computing cardinality see also notes references sources external links algebraic properties number line negative like the natural closed under the operations addition and multiplication that the sum and product any two integers however with the inclusion the negative natural and importantly unlike the natural also closed under subtraction the integers form unital ring which the most basic the following for any unital there unique ring homomorphism from the integers into this this universal property namely initial object the category rings characterizes the not closed under division since the quotient two integers divided need not although the natural numbers are closed under exponentiation the integers are not since the result can fraction when the exponent the following lists some the basic properties addition and multiplication for any integers and closure associativity commutativity identity element inverse elements distributivity zero divisors the language abstract algebra the first five properties listed above for addition say that under addition abelian group group under cyclic group since every zero integer can written finite sum under addition the only infinite cyclic the sense that any infinite cyclic group isomorphic the first four properties listed above for multiplication say that under multiplication commutative monoid however not every integer has multiplicative there integer such that because the left hand side while the right hand side this means that under multiplication not all the rules from the above property except for the taken together say that together with addition and multiplication commutative ring with unity the prototype all objects such algebraic structure only those equalities expressions are true for all values which are true any unital commutative note that certain zero integers map zero certain the says that the commutative integral domain provides the motivation for defining such the lack multiplicative which equivalent the fact that not closed under means that not field the smallest field with the usual operations containing the integers the field rational numbers the process constructing the rationals from the integers can mimicked form the field fractions any integral and starting from algebraic number field extension rational its ring integers can which includes its subring although ordinary division not defined the division with defined called euclidean division and possesses the following important that given two integers and with there exist unique integers and such that and where denotes the absolute value the integer called the quotient and called the remainder the division the euclidean algorithm for computing greatest common divisors works sequence euclidean again the language abstract the above says that euclidean domain this implies that principal ideal domain and any positive integer can written the products primes essentially unique this the fundamental theorem arithmetic order theoretic properties totally ordered set without upper lower the ordering given integer positive greater than zero and negative less than zero defined neither negative nor the ordering integers compatible with the algebraic operations the following and then and then follows that together with the above ordering ordered ring the integers are the only integral domain whose positive elements are well ordered and which order preserved addition construction natural numbers although the integers are intuitively defined adding zero and negative integers the natural such construction not very because the number case distinctions which would needed the definition arithmetical citation needed therefore more abstract which allows one define the arithmetical operations without any case usually preferred citation needed the integers can thus formally constructed the equivalence classes ordered pairs natural numbers the intuition that stands for the result subtracting from confirm our expectation that and denote the same define equivalence relation these pairs with the following precisely when addition and multiplication integers can defined terms the equivalent operations the natural denoting the equivalence class having one the negation additive integer obtained reversing the order the hence subtraction can defined the addition the additive the standard ordering the integers given iff easily verified that these definitions are independent the choice representatives the equivalence every equivalence class has unique member that the form both the natural number identified with the class other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers map sending and the class denoted this covers all remaining and gives the class second time since thus denoted the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers using the embedding mentioned this convention creates this notation recovers the familiar representation the integers some examples integers computing integer computer integer often primitive data type computer languages however integer data types can only represent subset all since practical computers are finite also the common two complement representation the inherent definition sign distinguishes between negative and rather than positive and however certainly possible for computer determine whether integer value truly fixed length integer approximation data types are denoted int integer several programming languages such algol java delphi etc variable length representations such bignums can store any integer that fits the other integer data types are implemented with fixed usually number bits which power etc memorable number decimal digits cardinality the cardinality the set integers equal aleph null this readily demonstrated the construction bijection that function that injective and surjective from then consider the then consider the the domain restricted then each and every member has one and only one corresponding member and the definition cardinal equality the two sets have equal see also mathematics portal canonical representation positive integer hyperinteger valued function integer lattice integer part integer sequence
