vertical lines and such that area above the axis adds the and that below the axis subtracts from the the term integral may also refer the related notion the antiderivative function whose derivative the given function this called indefinite integral and however the integrals discussed this article are termed definite integrals the principles integration were formulated independently isaac newton and gottfried leibniz the late through the fundamental theorem calculus which they independently integration connected with continuous valued function defined closed interval then once antiderivative the definite integral over that interval given integrals and derivatives became the basic tools with numerous applications science and engineering the founders calculus thought the integral infinite sum rectangles infinitesimal width rigorous mathematical definition the integral was given bernhard riemann based limiting procedure which approximates the area curvilinear region breaking the region into thin vertical beginning the nineteenth more sophisticated notions integrals began where the type the function well the domain over which the integration performed has been line integral defined

method exhaustion the ancient greek astronomer eudoxus which sought find areas and volumes breaking them into infinite number shapes for which the area volume was this method was further developed and employed archimedes the century and used calculate areas for parabolas and approximation the area similar methods were independently developed china around the century liu hui who used find the area the this method was later used the century chinese son mathematicians chongzhi and geng find the volume sphere shea katz the next significant advances integral calculus did not begin appear until the this time the work cavalieri with his method indivisibles and work fermat began lay the foundations modern with cavalieri computing the integrals degree cavalieri quadrature formula further steps were made the early century barrow and torricelli who provided the first hints connection between integration and differentiation barrow provided the first proof the fundamental theorem calculus wallis generalized computing integrals general including negative powers and fractional newton and leibniz the major advance integration came the century with the independent discovery the fundamental theorem calculus newton and leibniz the theorem demonstrates connection between integration and this combined with the comparative ease can exploited calculate the fundamental theorem calculus allows one solve much broader class equal importance the comprehensive mathematical framework that both newton and leibniz given the name infinitesimal allowed for precise analysis functions within continuous this framework eventually became modern calculus whose notation for integrals drawn directly from the work formalizing integrals while newton and leibniz provided systematic approach their work lacked degree rigour bishop berkeley memorably attacked the vanishing increments used calling them ghosts departed quantities calculus acquired firmer footing with the development limits integration was first rigorously using riemann although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are riemann integrable bounded subsequently more general functions were particularly the context fourier analysis which definition does not and lebesgue formulated different definition founded measure theory subfield real analysis other definitions extending and were these approaches based the real number system are the ones most common but alternative approaches such definition integral the standard part infinite riemann based the hyperreal number system historical notation isaac newton used small vertical bar above variable indicate placed the variable inside the vertical bar was easily confused with which newton used indicate and the box notation was difficult for printers these notations were not widely the modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced gottfried leibniz burton leibniz adapted the integral symbol from the letter long standing for summa written umma latin for sum total the modern notation for the definite with limits above and below the integral was first used joseph fourier moires the french academy around reprinted his book cajori fourier terminology and notation the simplest the integral over valued function written the integral sign represents the indicates that are integrating over called the variable inside the the expression called the integrand correct mathematical the separated from the integrand space some authors use upright that instead this case the integrand the function because there domain the integral called indefinite integral when integrating over specified speak definite integral integrating over domain written the domain interval the domain the interval called the domain integration function has said integrable the integrand may function more than one and the domain integration may volume dimensional even abstract space that does not have geometric structure any usual sense such sample space probability the modern arabic mathematical notation which aims university levels education the arab world and written from right reflected integral symbol used the variable integration has different interpretations depending the theory being can seen strictly notation indicating that dummy variable the integral seen riemann sum reflection the weights widths the intervals lebesgue integration and its measure non standard analysis infinitesimal can seen independent mathematical differential form more complicated cases may vary the notation interpreted infinitesimal change although interpretation lacks rigour his integration notation the most common one use introduction integrals appear many practical swimming pool rectangular with flat then from its width and depth can easily determine the volume water can contain fill the area its surface cover and the length its edge rope but oval with rounded all these quantities call for practical approximations may suffice for such trivial but precision engineering any requires exact and rigorous values for these start consider the curve between and with and call this yet area the integral the notation for this integral will first look the unit square given the sides and and its area exactly the true value the integral must somewhat decreasing the width the approximation rectangles shall give better cross the interval five using the approximation points and fit box for each step using the right end height each curve thus and summing the areas these get better approximation for the sought namely are taking sum finitely many function values multiplied with the differences two subsequent approximation can easily see that the approximation still too using more steps produces closer but will never replacing the subintervals twelve the same but with the left end height each will get approximate value for the area which too the key idea the transition from adding finitely many differences approximation points multiplied their respective function values using infinitely many infinitesimal steps for the actual calculation integrals the fundamental theorem calculus due newton and the fundamental link between the operations differentiating and applied the square root says look the antiderivative and simply take where and are the boundaries the interval the exact value the area under the curve computed formally this case general that for with the related the called antiderivative the notation conceives the integral weighted denoted the elongated function multiplied infinitesimal step the called differentials denoted the multiplication sign usually historically after the failure early efforts rigorously interpret riemann formally defined integrals limit weighted that the suggested the limit difference the interval shortcomings dependence intervals and continuity motivated newer especially the lebesgue integral which founded ability extend the idea measure much more flexible thus the notation refers weighted sum which the function values are with measuring the weight assigned each here denotes the region differential geometry with its calculus manifolds gives the familiar notation yet another now and become differential form new differential operator known the exterior derivative and the fundamental theorem becomes the more general stokes theorem from which green theorem the divergence theorem and the fundamental theorem calculus follow more infinitesimals have reappeared with through modern innovations such non standard analysis not only these methods vindicate the intuitions the they also lead new although there are differences between these conceptions there considerable thus the area the surface the oval swimming pool can handled geometric sum riemann lebesgue manifold with differential the calculated result will the same for darboux sums formal definitions there are many ways formally defining not all which are the differences exist mostly deal with differing special cases which may not integrable under other but also occasionally for pedagogical the most commonly used definitions integral are riemann integrals and lebesgue riemann integral riemann integral the riemann integral defined terms riemann sums functions with respect tagged partitions let closed interval the real then tagged partition finite sequence this partitions the interval into sub intervals indexed each which tagged with distinguished point riemann sum function with respect such tagged partition defined thus each term the sum the area rectangle with height equal the function value the distinguished point the given and width the same the interval let the width interval then the mesh such tagged partition the width the largest interval formed the max the riemann integral function over the interval equal when the chosen tags give the maximum minimum value each the riemann sum becomes upper lower darboux sum suggesting the close connection between the riemann integral and the darboux integral lebesgue integral lebesgue integration often both theory and able pass the limit under the for sequence functions can frequently constructed that suitable the solution then the integral the solution function should the limit the integrals the however many functions that can obtained limits are not riemann and such limit theorems not hold with the riemann therefore great importance have definition the integral that allows wider class functions integrated rudin such integral the lebesgue that exploits the following fact enlarge the class integrable the values function are rearranged over the the integral function should remain the thus henri lebesgue introduced the integral bearing his explaining this integral thus letter paul montel have pay certain which have collected take the bills and coins out pocket and give them the creditor the order find them until have reached the total this the riemann but can proceed after have taken all the money out pocket order the bills and coins according identical values and then pay the several heaps one after the other the this source schultze folland puts compute the riemann integral one partitions the domain into while the lebesgue one effect partitioning the range the definition the lebesgue integral thus begins with measure the simplest the lebesgue measure interval its that the lebesgue integral agrees with the riemann integral when both more complicated the sets being measured can highly with continuity and resemblance using the partitioning the range philosophy the integral negative function should the sum over the areas between thin horizontal strip between and this area just let the lebesgue integral then defined lieb loss where the integral the right ordinary improper riemann integral strictly decreasing positive and therefore has defined improper riemann for suitable class functions the measurable functions this defines the lebesgue general measurable function lebesgue integrable the area between the graph and the axis that the integral the riemannian the difference between the area above the axis and the area below the where other integrals although the riemann and lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions the number others including the darboux integral which equivalent riemann integral meaning that function integrable and only and the values the two they are darboux integrals have the advantage being simpler define than riemann the riemann stieltjes integral extension the riemann the lebesgue stieltjes integral further developed johann radon which generalizes the riemann stieltjes and lebesgue integrals the daniell integral which subsumes the lebesgue integral and lebesgue stieltjes integral without the dependence

functions with values locally compact topological vector see hildebrandt for axiomatic characterisation the inequalities for integrals number general inequalities hold for integrable functions defined closed and bounded interval and can generalized other notions integral lebesgue and upper and lower integrable function necessarily bounded that thus there are real numbers and that for all since the lower and upper sums over are therefore bounded respectively and follows that inequalities between for each then each the upper and lower sums bounded above the upper and lower respectively thus subinterval and negative for all then products and absolute values and are two functions then may consider their pointwise products and and absolute values schwarz inequality hilbert space inner product integrable suppose that and are two real with and and are two integrable then the functions and are also integrable and the following inequality holds minkowski inequality suppose that real number and and are integrable then and are also riemann integrable and the following minkowski inequality holds spaces conventions this section real valued riemann integrable function the integral over interval defined this means that the upper and lower sums the function are evaluated partition whose values are geometrically this signifies that integration takes place left evaluating within intervals where interval with higher index lies the right one with lower the values and the points the interval are called the limits integration integrals can also defined reversing limits then define with implies integrals over intervals length real number then the first convention necessary consideration taking integrals over subintervals the second says that integral taken over degenerate point should zero one reason for the first convention that the integrability interval implies that integrable any subinterval but particular integrals have the property additivity integration any element then with the first convention the resulting relation then defined for any cyclic permutation and instead viewing the above one can also adopt the point view that integration performed differential forms oriented manifolds only such oriented dimensional and the same manifold with opposed orientation and then one these conventions correspond interpreting the integrand differential integrated over chain measure theory one interprets the integrand function with respect measure and integrates over subset without any notion one writes indicate integration over subset this minor distinction one but becomes subtler dimensional see differential relation with measures for fundamental theorem calculus fundamental theorem calculus the fundamental theorem calculus the statement that differentiation and integration are inverse continuous function first integrated and then the original function important sometimes called the second fundamental theorem calculus allows one compute integrals using antiderivative the function statements theorems fundamental theorem calculus let continuous valued function defined closed interval let the function for all continuous differentiable the open interval and for all second fundamental theorem calculus let valued function defined closed interval that admits antiderivative that and are functions such that for all integrable then extensions improper integrals improper integral improper integral proper riemann integral assumes the integrand defined and finite closed and bounded bracketed the limits improper integral occurs when one more these conditions not some cases such integrals may defined considering the limit sequence proper riemann integrals progressively larger the interval for instance its upper then the improper integral the limit that endpoint goes the integrand only defined finite open for instance then again limit may provide finite that the improper integral the limit proper integrals one endpoint the interval integration approaches either specified real number more complicated limits are required both interior consider for the function integrated from shown the lower goes the function goes and the upper bound itself though the function goes thus this doubly improper integrated say from ordinary riemann sum suffices produce result integrate from riemann sum not however any finite upper say with gives defined this has finite limit goes namely similarly the integral from allows riemann sum coincidentally again producing replacing arbitrary positive value with equally giving this too has finite limit goes namely combining the limits the two the result this improper integral this process does not guarantee limit might fail might for over the bounded interval from the integral does not and over the unbounded interval from the integral does not improper integral might also happen that integrand unbounded interior which case the integral must split that for the integral whole the limit integrals both sides must exist and must for but the similar integral cannot assigned value this the integrals above and below zero not independently see cauchy principal value multiple integration multiple integral integrals can taken over regions other than integral over set function here need not real but can another suitable for vector fubini theorem shows that such integrals can rewritten iterated integral other the integral can calculated integrating one coordinate just the definite integral positive function one variable represents the area the region between the graph the function and the the double integral positive function two variables represents the volume the region between the surface defined the function and the plane which contains its domain the same volume can obtained via the triple integral the integral function three the constant function over the above mentioned region between the surface and the the number variables then the integral represents hypervolume volume solid more than three dimensions that cannot for the volume the cuboid sides may obtained two the double integral the triple integral line integrals line integral the concept integral can extended more general domains such curved lines and such integrals are known line integrals and surface integrals these have important applications when dealing with vector fields line integral sometimes called path integral integral where the function integrated evaluated along curve various different line integrals are the case closed curve also called contour integral the function integrated may scalar field vector field the value the line integral the sum values the field all points the weighted some scalar function the curve commonly arc length for vector the scalar product the vector field with differential vector the this weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined intervals many simple formulas physics have natural continuous analogs terms line for the fact that work equal force multiplied may expressed terms vector for object moving along path vector field such electric field gravitational field the total work done the field the object obtained summing the differential work done moving from this gives the line integral surface integrals surface integral surface integral definite integral taken over surface which may curved set space can thought the double integral analog the line integral the function integrated may scalar field vector field the value the surface integral the sum the field all points the this can achieved splitting the surface into surface which provide the partitioning for riemann for example applications surface consider vector field surface that for each point imagine that have fluid flowing through such that determines the velocity the fluid the flux defined the quantity fluid flowing through unit amount find the need take the dot product with the unit surface normal each which will give scalar which integrate over the the fluid flux this example may from physical fluid such water from electrical magnetic thus surface integrals have applications physics particularly with the classical theory electromagnetism integrals differential forms differential form differential form mathematical concept the fields multivariable calculus differential topology and tensors the modern notation for the differential well the idea the differential forms being the wedge products exterior derivatives forming exterior algebra was introduced lie cartan initially work open set form defined smooth function when integrate function over dimensional subspace write the superscripts are not can consider through formal objects rather than tags appended make integrals look like riemann sums alternatively can view them covectors and thus measure density hence integrable general call the basic forms define the wedge product bilinear multiplication operator these with the alternating property that for all indices alternation along with linearity and associativity implies this also ensures that the result the wedge product has orientation define the set all these products basic forms and similarly define the set products the form basic forms general form then weighted sum basic forms where the weights are the smooth functions together these form vector space with basic forms the basis and forms smooth the field the wedge product then extends forms the natural over most covectors can linearly thus form with will always the alternating addition the wedge there also the exterior derivative operator this operator maps forms for form over define the action with extension general forms occurring this more general approach allows for more natural free approach integration manifolds also allows for natural generalisation the fundamental theorem calculus called stokes theorem which may state where general and denotes the boundary the region thus the case that form and closed interval the real this reduces the fundamental theorem calculus the case that form and dimensional region the the theorem reduces green theorem similarly using and forms and hodge duality can arrive stokes theorem and the divergence theorem this way can see that differential forms provide powerful unifying view summations the discrete equivalent integration summation summations and integrals can put the same foundations using the theory lebesgue integrals time scale calculus methods for computing integrals analytical the most basic technique for computing definite integrals one real variable based the fundamental theorem calculus let the function integrated over given interval then find antiderivative that function such that the provided the integrand and integral have singularities the path the fundamental theorem the integral not actually the but the fundamental theorem provides way use antiderivatives evaluate definite the most difficult step usually find the antiderivative rarely possible glance function and write down its more necessary use one the many techniques that have been developed evaluate most these techniques rewrite one integral different one which hopefully more techniques integration substitution integration parts inverse function integration changing the order integration integration trigonometric substitution tangent angle substitution integration partial fractions integration reduction formulae integration using parametric derivatives integration using formula euler substitution differentiation under the integral sign contour integration alternative methods exist compute more complex many nonelementary integrals can expanded taylor series and integrated term occasionally the resulting infinite series can summed the method convolution using meijer functions can also assuming that the integrand can written product meijer there are also many less common ways calculating definite for parseval identity can used transform integral over rectangular region into infinite occasionally integral can evaluated for example see gaussian integral computations volumes solids revolution can usually done with disk integration shell integration specific results which have been worked out various techniques are collected the list integrals symbolic symbolic integration many problems physics and engineering involve integration where explicit formula for the integral extensive tables integrals have been compiled and published over the years for this with the spread computers many educators and students have turned computer algebra systems that are specifically designed perform difficult tedious including symbolic integration has been one the motivations for the development the first such like macsyma major mathematical difficulty symbolic integration that many closed formula for the antiderivative rather looking function does not for known that the antiderivatives the functions and sin cannot expressed the closed form involving only rational and exponential functions logarithm trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions and the operations multiplication and other none the three given functions integrable elementary functions which are the functions which may built from rational roots polynomial logarithm and exponential the risch algorithm provides general criterion determine whether the antiderivative elementary function and compute unfortunately turns out that functions with closed expressions antiderivatives are the exception rather than the consequently computerized algebra systems have hope being able find antiderivative for randomly constructed elementary the positive the building for antiderivatives are fixed may still possible decide whether the antiderivative given function can expressed using these blocks and operations multiplication and and find the symbolic answer whenever the risch algorithm implemented mathematica and other computer algebra systems does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational radicals logarithm and exponential some special integrands occur often enough warrant special may useful the set the special functions physics like the legendre functions the hypergeometric function the gamma function the incomplete gamma function and see symbolic integration for more extending the algorithm include such functions possible but challenging and has been active research more recently new approach has using finite function which are the solutions linear differential equations with polynomial most the elementary and special functions are finite and the integral finite function also finite this provide algorithm express the antiderivative finite function the solution differential this theory allows also compute definite integrals function the sum series given the first coefficients and algorithm compute any numerical numerical integration the integrals encountered basic calculus course are deliberately chosen for those found real applications are not always some integrals cannot found some require special functions which themselves are challenge and others are complex that finding the exact answer too this motivates the study and application numerical methods for approximating which today use floating point arithmetic digital electronic many the ideas arose much for hand but the speed purpose computers like the eniac created need for the goals numerical integration are reliability efficiency and sophisticated methods can vastly outperform naive method all four measures dahlquist rck kahaner moler nash stoer bulirsch consider for the integral which has the exact answer ordinary practice the answer not known important not explored decide when approximation good calculus approach divides the integration range say equal and computes function using the left end each the rectangle method sums function values and multiplies the step here get approximate value for the the accuracy not but calculus formally uses pieces infinitesimal initially this may seem little cause for indeed repeatedly doubling the number steps eventually produces approximation however pieces are great computational expense for such little and reach for greater accuracy can force steps small that arithmetic precision becomes better approach replaces the horizontal tops the rectangles with slanted tops touching the function the ends each this trapezium rule almost easy sums all function but weights the first and last one and again multiplies the step this immediately improves the approximation which noticeably more furthermore only pieces are needed achieve substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable romberg method builds the trapezoid method great first the step lengths are halved giving trapezoid approximations denoted and where half for each new step only half the new function values need the others carry over from the previous size shown the table but the really powerful idea interpolate polynomial through the and extrapolate with this method numerically exact answer here requires only four pieces five function the lagrange polynomial interpolating producing the extrapolated value gaussian quadrature often requires noticeably less work for superior this can compute the function values just two positions then double each value and sum get the numerically exact the explanation for this dramatic success lies error and little point gaussian method exact for polynomials degree the function this example degree polynomial plus term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around cancellation also benefits the romberg shifting the range left the integral from removes the nevertheless the trapezoid method rather the polynomial interpolation method romberg and the gaussian method requires the least the number points known rational interpolation can use the same trapezoid evaluations the romberg method greater trapezoid romberg rational gauss each method must use extra evaluations ensure error bound unknown this tends offset some the advantage the pure gaussian and motivates the popular gauss kronrod quadrature formulae symmetry can still exploited splitting this integral into two from and from more adaptive quadrature partitions range into pieces based function that data points are concentrated where they are needed simpson rule named for thomas simpson uses parabolic curve approximate many more accurate than the trapezoidal rule and the rule states that with error the computation dimensional integrals for volume makes important use such alternatives monte carlo integration calculus text substitute for numerical but the reverse also even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires user help with the more demanding for improper integrals may require change variable methods that can avoid infinite function and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical mechanical the area arbitrary dimensional shape can determined using measuring instrument called planimeter the volume irregular objects can measured with precision the fluid
