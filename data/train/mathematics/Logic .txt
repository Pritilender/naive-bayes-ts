logic from the ancient greek logike the use and study valid reasoning the study logic features most prominently the subjects philosophy mathematics and computer science logic was studied several ancient including india china persia and greece the logic was established formal discipline aristotle who gave fundamental place the study logic was part the classical trivium which also included grammar and logic was further extended farabi who categorized into two separate groups idea and later avicenna revived the study logic and developed relationship between temporalis and the the logic was developed buddhists and jains logic often divided into three inductive reasoning abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning contents the study logic logical form deductive and inductive and abductive inference consistency validity soundness and completeness rival conceptions logic history types logic syllogistic logic propositional logic sentential predicate logic modal logic informal reasoning mathematical logic philosophical logic computational logic bivalence and the law the excluded middle logic implication strict tolerating the impossible rejection logical truth see also notes and references bibliography external links the study logic charles sanders peirce first rule the concept logical form central being held that the validity argument determined its logical not its traditional aristotelian syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples formal informal logic the study natural language arguments the study fallacies especially important branch informal the dialogues plato are good examples informal formal logic the study inference with purely formal inference possesses purely formal content can expressed particular application wholly abstract that rule that not about any particular thing the works aristotle contain the earliest known formal study modern formal logic follows and expands many definitions logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the this does not render the notion informal logic because formal logic captures all the nuance natural symbolic logic the study symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features logical symbolic logic often divided into two propositional logic and predicate logic mathematical logic extension symbolic logic into other particular the study model theory proof theory set theory and recursion theory logical form logical form logic generally considered formal when analyzes and represents the form any valid argument the form argument displayed representing its sentences the formal grammar and symbolism logical language make its content usable formal one considers the notion form too philosophically one could say that formalizing simply means translating english sentences into the language this called showing the logical form the necessary because indicative sentences ordinary language show considerable variety form and complexity that makes their use inference first ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant logic such gender and the argument replacing conjunctions irrelevant logic such with logical conjunctions like and replacing alternative logical expressions etc with expressions standard type such the universal quantifier second certain parts the sentence must replaced with schematic thus for the expression all are shows the logical form common the sentences all men are mortals all cats are carnivores all greeks are philosophers and that the concept form fundamental logic was already recognized ancient aristotle uses variable letters represent valid inferences prior analytics leading jan ukasiewicz say that the introduction variables was one greatest according the followers aristotle such ammonius only the logical principles stated schematic terms belong not those given concrete the concrete terms man mortal etc are analogous the substitution values the schematic placeholders which were called the greek the the fundamental difference between modern formal logic and aristotelian lies their differing analysis the logical form the sentences they the traditional the form the sentence consists subject plus sign quantity the copula which the form predicate thus all men are the logical constants such and plus sentential connectives such and were called terms from the greek and together this fixed where each judgment has identified quantity and determining the logical form the according the modern the fundamental form simple sentence given recursive involving logical connectives such quantifier with its bound which are joined juxtaposition other which turn may have logical the modern view more since single judgement system involves two more logical for the sentence all men are involves term two logical terms here and here the sentence given the judgement predicate logic the sentence involves the same two logical here analyzed and and the sentence given involving the logical connectives for universal quantification and implication but the modern view more medieval logicians recognized the problem multiple generality where aristotelian logic unable satisfactorily render such sentences some guys have all the because both quantities all and some may relevant but the fixed scheme that aristotle used allows only one govern the just linguists recognize recursive structure natural appears that logic needs recursive deductive and inductive and abductive inference deductive reasoning concerns what follows necessarily from given premises then however inductive reasoning the process deriving reliable generalization from has sometimes been included the study similarly important distinguish deductive validity and inductive validity called cogency inference deductively valid and only there possible situation which all the premises are true but the conclusion inductive argument can neither valid nor its premises give only some degree but not its the notion deductive validity can rigorously stated for systems formal logic terms the understood notions semantics inductive validity the other hand requires define reliable generalization some set the task providing this definition may approached various some less formal than some these definitions may use mathematical models for the most part this discussion logic deals only with deductive abduction form logical inference that goes from observation hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks explain relevant the american philosopher charles sanders peirce first introduced the term guessing peirce said that abduce hypothetical explanation from observed surprising circumstance surmise that may true because then would matter thus abduce from involves determining that sufficient nearly but not necessary for consistency validity soundness and completeness among the important properties that logical systems can consistency which means that theorem the system contradicts validity which means that the rules proof never allow false inference from true logical system has the property soundness when the logical system has the property validity and uses only premises that prove true the case are true completeness logical which means that formula can proven theorem the soundness the term soundness has multiple separate which creates bit confusion throughout the most soundness refers logical which means that some formula can proven then true the relevant structure this the converse peripheral use soundness refers which means that the premises valid argument are true the actual some logical systems not have all four kurt del incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems arithmetic cannot consistent and however first order predicate logics not extended specific axioms arithmetic formal systems with equality can complete and rival conceptions logic definitions logic logic arose see from concern with correctness argumentation modern logicians usually wish ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms for thomas hofweber writes the stanford encyclopedia philosophy that logic does however cover good reasoning that the job the theory rationality rather deals with inferences whose validity can traced back the formal features the representations that are involved that they mental other immanuel kant argued that logic should conceived the science idea taken gottlob frege logical and philosophical but work ambiguous the sense that both concerned with the laws well with the laws both treats logic the context theory the and treats logic the study abstract formal history history logic aristotle logic was first developed aristotle aristotelian logic became widely accepted science and mathematics and remained wide use the west until the early aristotle system logic was responsible for the introduction hypothetical syllogism temporal modal logic and inductive logic well influential terms such terms predicables syllogisms and propositions europe during the later medieval major efforts were made show that ideas were compatible with christian faith during the high middle ages logic became main focus who would engage critical logical analyses philosophical often using variations the methodology scholasticism william ockham influential summa logicae was the the structured approach arguments had degenerated and fallen out depicted holberg satirical play erasmus montanus the chinese logical philosopher gongsun long bce proposed the paradox one and one cannot become since neither becomes the tradition scholarly investigation into however was repressed the qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy han feizi innovations the scholastic called nyaya continued from ancient times into the early century with the navya nyaya school the developed theories resembling modern such gottlob frege distinction between sense and reference proper and his definition well the theory restrictive conditions for anticipating some the developments modern set theory since indian logic attracted the attention many western and has had influence important century logicians such charles babbage augustus morgan and george boole the western philosophers like stanislaw schayer and klaus glashoff have explored indian logic more the syllogistic logic developed aristotle predominated the west until the when interest the foundations mathematics stimulated the development symbolic logic now called mathematical logic george boole published investigation the laws thought which are founded the mathematical theories logic and probabilities introducing symbolic logic and the principles what now known boolean logic gottlob frege published begriffsschrift which inaugurated modern logic with the invention quantifier notation from alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell published principia mathematica the foundations attempting derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules symbolic del raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased focus such the development logic since russell and wittgenstein had profound influence the practice philosophy and the perceived nature philosophical problems see analytic philosophy and philosophy mathematics logic especially sentential implemented computer logic circuits and fundamental computer science logic commonly taught university philosophy often compulsory types logic syllogistic logic aristotelian logic the organon was aristotle body work with the prior analytics constituting the first explicit work formal introducing the the parts syllogistic also known the name term logic are the analysis the judgements into propositions consisting two terms that are related one fixed number and the expression inferences means syllogisms that consist two propositions sharing common term and conclusion that proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the aristotle work was regarded classical times and from medieval times europe and the middle east the very picture fully worked out however was not the stoics proposed system propositional logic that was studied medieval also the problem multiple generality was recognised medieval nonetheless problems with syllogistic logic were not seen being need revolutionary today some academics claim that system generally seen having little more than historical value though there some current interest extending term regarded made obsolete the advent propositional logic and the predicate calculus others use aristotle argumentation theory help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used artificial intelligence and legal arguments propositional logic sentential propositional calculus propositional calculus logic also sentential formal system which formulae representing propositions can formed combining atomic propositions using logical connectives and which system formal proof rules establishes certain formulae theorems predicate logic predicate logic predicate logic the generic term for symbolic formal systems such first order logic second order logic many sorted logic and infinitary logic predicate logic provides account quantifiers general enough express wide set arguments occurring natural aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies small number forms that the relevant part the involved judgements may predicate logic allows sentences analysed into subject and argument several additional allowing predicate logic solve the problem multiple generality that had perplexed medieval the development predicate logic usually attributed gottlob frege who also credited one the founders analytical philosophy but the formulation predicate logic most often used today the order logic presented principles mathematical logic david hilbert and wilhelm ackermann the analytical generality predicate logic allowed the formalisation drove the investigation set theory and allowed the development alfred tarski approach model theory provides the foundation modern mathematical logic frege original system predicate logic was rather than second order logic most prominently defended against the criticism willard van orman quine and george boolos and stewart shapiro modal logic modal logic modality deals with the phenomenon that parts sentence may have their semantics modified special verbs modal for the games can modified give should the games and can the games and perhaps will the games more might say that modality affects the circumstances which take assertion aristotle logic large parts concerned with the theory modalized although there are passages his such the famous sea battle argument interpretatione that are now seen anticipations modal logic and its connection with potentiality and the earliest formal system modal logic was developed avicenna whom ultimately developed theory temporally modalized syllogistic while the study necessity and possibility remained important little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations clarence irving lewis who formulated family rival axiomatizations the alethic his work unleashed torrent new work the expanding the kinds modality treated include deontic logic and epistemic logic the seminal work arthur prior applied the same formal language treat temporal logic and paved the way for the marriage the two saul kripke discovered contemporaneously with his theory frame semantics which revolutionised the formal technology available modal logicians and gave new graph theoretic way looking modality that has driven many applications computational linguistics and computer science such dynamic logic informal reasoning informal logic the motivation for the study logic ancient times was that one may learn distinguish good from bad and become more effective argument and and perhaps also become better half the works organon treat inference occurs informal side side with the development the and the aristotelian these informal works logic were seen complementary treatment rhetoric this ancient motivation still although longer takes centre stage the picture typically dialectical logic forms the heart course critical thinking compulsory course many argumentation theory the study and research informal fallacies and critical questions they relate every day and practical specific types dialogue can analyzed and questioned reveal conclusions and argumentation theory now applied artificial intelligence and law mathematical logic mathematical logic mathematical logic really refers two distinct areas the first the application the techniques formal logic mathematics and mathematical and the the other the application mathematical techniques the representation and analysis formal the earliest use mathematics and geometry relation logic and philosophy goes back the ancient greeks such euclid plato and aristotle many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods their philosophical kurt del one the boldest attempts apply logic mathematics was undoubtedly the logicism pioneered logicians such gottlob frege and bertrand russell the idea was that mathematical theories were logical tautologies and the programme was show this means reduction mathematics the various attempts carry this out met with series from the crippling project his grundgesetze russell paradox the defeat hilbert program incompleteness theorems both the statement program and its refutation del depended upon their work establishing the second area mathematical the application mathematics logic the form proof theory despite the negative nature the incompleteness completeness theorem result model theory and another application mathematics can understood showing how close logicism came being every rigorously defined mathematical theory can exactly captured order logical frege proof calculus enough describe the whole though not equivalent thus see how complementary the two areas mathematical logic have citation needed proof theory and model theory have been the foundation mathematical they have been but two the four pillars the set theory originated the study the infinite georg cantor and has been the source many the most challenging and important issues mathematical from cantor theorem through the status the axiom choice and the question the independence the continuum hypothesis the modern debate large cardinal axioms recursion theory captures the idea computation logical and arithmetic terms its most classical achievements are the undecidability the entscheidungsproblem alan turing and his presentation the church turing thesis today recursion theory mostly concerned with the more refined problem complexity classes when problem efficiently and the classification degrees unsolvability philosophical logic philosophical logic philosophical logic deals with formal descriptions non specialist natural language most philosophers assume that the bulk everyday reasoning can captured logic method methods translate ordinary language into that logic can philosophical logic essentially continuation the traditional discipline called logic before the invention mathematical philosophical logic has much greater concern with the connection between natural language and philosophical logicians have contributed great deal the development standard logics free logics tense logics well various extensions classical logic modal logics and standard semantics for such logics kripke supervaluationism the semantics logic and the philosophy language are closely philosophy language has with the study how our language engages and interacts with our logic has immediate impact other areas studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments many popular arguments are filled with errors because many people are untrained logic and unaware how formulate argument computational logic logic computer science logic cut the heart computer science emerged alan turing work the entscheidungsproblem followed from kurt del work the incompleteness theorems the notion the general purpose computer that came from this work was fundamental importance the designers the computer machinery the the and researchers predicted that when human knowledge could expressed using logic with mathematical notation would possible create machine that artificial this was more difficult than expected because the complexity human logic programming program consists set axioms and logic programming systems such prolog compute the consequences the axioms and rules order answer today logic extensively applied the fields artificial intelligence and computer science and these fields provide rich source problems formal and informal argumentation theory one good example how logic being applied artificial the acm computing classification system particular section logics and meanings programs and mathematical logic and formal languages part the theory computer this work covers formal semantics programming languages well work formal methods such hoare logic boolean logic fundamental computer particularly the section arithmetic and logic structures relating operatives not and many fundamental logical formalisms are essential section artificial for example modal logic and default logic knowledge representation formalisms and methods horn clauses logic and description logic furthermore computers can used tools for for symbolic logic and mathematical proofs humans can using automated theorem proving the machines can find and check well work with proofs too lengthy write out bivalence and the law the excluded middle principle bivalence the logics discussed above are all bivalent that they are most naturally understood dividing propositions into true and false non classical logics are those systems that reject hegel developed his own dialectic logic that extended kant transcendental logic but also brought back ground assuring that neither heaven nor neither the world mind nor there anywhere such abstract the understanding whatever exists with difference and opposition nicolai vasiliev extended the law excluded middle and the law contradiction and proposed the law excluded fourth and logic tolerant the early century jan ukasiewicz investigated the extension the traditional false values include third possible inventing ternary logic the first multi valued logic citation needed logics such fuzzy logic have since been devised with infinite number degrees represented real number between and intuitionistic logic was proposed brouwer the correct logic for reasoning about based upon his rejection the law the excluded middle part his intuitionism brouwer rejected formalisation but his student arend heyting studied intuitionistic logic did gerhard gentzen intuitionistic logic great interest computer constructive logic and can applied for extracting verified programs from modal logic not truth and has often been proposed classical however modal logic normally formalised with the principle the excluded and its relational semantics this inclusion logic logic what the epistemological status the laws logic what sort argument appropriate for criticizing purported principles influential paper entitled logic hilary putnam building suggestion quine argued that general the facts propositional logic have similar epistemological status facts about the physical for example the laws mechanics general relativity and particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles classical want realists about the physical phenomena described quantum then should abandon the principle distributivity substituting for classical logic the quantum logic proposed garrett birkhoff and john von neumann another paper the same name sir michael dummett argues that desire for realism mandates the law distributivity logic essential for the understanding how propositions are true the world just the same way has argued the principle bivalence this the logic can seen lead naturally into the fundamental controversy metaphysics realism versus realism implication strict paradox entailment obvious that the notion implication formalised classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language means then due number problems called the paradoxes material implication the first class paradoxes involves such the moon made green then which are puzzling because natural language does not support the principle explosion eliminating this class paradoxes was the reason for lewis formulation strict implication which eventually led more radically revisionist logics such relevance logic the second class paradoxes involves redundant falsely suggesting that know the succedent because the thus that man gets granny will materially true since granny regardless the election such sentences violate the gricean maxim and can modelled logics that reject the principle monotonicity entailment such relevance tolerating the impossible paraconsistent logic hegel was deeply critical any simplified notion the law contradiction was based leibniz idea that this law logic also requires sufficient ground specify from what point view one says that something cannot contradict for both moves and does not the ground for the first our solar system and for the second the hegelian the law itself relies upon difference and not independently closely related questions arising from the paradoxes implication comes the suggestion that logic ought tolerate inconsistency relevance logic and paraconsistent logic are the most important approaches though the concerns are key consequence classical logic and some its such intuitionistic logic that they respect the principle explosion which means that the logic collapses capable deriving graham priest the main proponent dialetheism has argued for paraconsistency the grounds that there are true rejection logical truth the philosophical vein various kinds skepticism contains many kinds doubt and rejection the various bases which logic such the idea logical correct typically leading the conclusion that there are logical truths observe that this opposite the usual views philosophical skepticism where logic directs skeptical enquiry doubt received the work sextus empiricus friedrich nietzsche provides strong example the rejection the usual basis his radical rejection idealisation led him reject truth mobile army metonyms and short metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only longer his rejection truth did not lead him reject the idea either inference logic but rather suggested that logic into existence head whose realm originally must have been innumerable beings who made inferences way different from ours thus there the idea that logical inference has use tool for human but that its existence does not support the existence nor does have reality beyond the too also rests assumptions that not correspond anything the real this position held nietzsche has come under extreme scrutiny for several fails demonstrate the validity his claims and merely asserts them although since criticising the established criteria this does not undermine his position for one could argue that the demonstration validity provided the name logic was just rhetorically some such rgen habermas claim his position and accuse nietzsche not even having coherent let alone theory again unclear this decisive critique for the criteria coherency and consistent theory are exactly what
