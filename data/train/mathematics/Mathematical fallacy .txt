mathematical fallacy false proof navigation search mathematics certain kinds mistaken proof are often and sometimes illustrations concept mathematical fallacy there distinction between simple mistake and mathematical fallacy mistake proof leads invalid proof just the same but the known examples mathematical there some concealment the presentation the for the reason validity fails may division zero that hidden algebraic there striking quality the mathematical typically leads not only absurd but does crafty clever therefore these for pedagogic usually take the form spurious proofs obvious contradictions although the proofs are the usually are comparatively designed show that certain steps are and should not applied the cases that are the exceptions the the traditional way presenting mathematical fallacy give invalid step deduction mixed with valid that the meaning fallacy here slightly different from the logical fallacy the latter applies normally form argument that not genuine rule where the problematic mathematical step typically correct rule applied with tacit wrong beyond the resolution fallacy can lead deeper insights into subject such the introduction pasch axiom euclidean geometry pseudaria ancient lost book false attributed euclid mathematical fallacies exist many branches elementary algebra typical examples may involve step where division zero where root incorrectly extracted more where different values multiple valued function are well known fallacies also exist elementary euclidean geometry and calculus contents howlers division zero all numbers equal all other numbers multivalued functions calculus power and root positive and negative roots complex exponents geometry fallacy the isosceles triangle proof induction see also notes references external links howlers examples exist mathematically correct results derived incorrect lines reasoning such however true the mathematically invalid and commonly known howler consider for instance the although the conclusion there invalid cancellation the middle bogus calculations derivations constructed produce correct result spite incorrect logic operations were termed howlers outside the field mathematics the term howler has various generally less division zero the division zero fallacy has many all numbers equal all other numbers the following example uses division zero prove that but can modified prove that any number equals any other let and equal zero quantities multiply subtract factor both sides divide out observing that combine like terms the left divide the zero the fallacy line the progression from line line involves division which zero since equals since division zero the argument multivalued functions many functions not have unique inverse for instance squaring number gives unique but there are two possible square roots positive the square root multivalued one value can chosen convention the principal value the case the square root the negative value the principal but there guarantee that the square root function given this principal value the square number will equal the original the square root the square calculus calculus the mathematical study infinitesimal change and limits can lead mathematical fallacies the properties integrals and differentials are for naive use integration parts can used give false proof that letting log and may after which the antiderivatives may cancelled yielding the problem that antiderivatives are only defined constant and shifting them indeed any number the error really comes light when introduce arbitrary integration limits and since the difference between two values constant function the same definite integral appears both sides the power and root fallacies involving disregarding the rules elementary arithmetic through incorrect manipulation the radical for complex numbers the failure power and logarithm identities has led many positive and negative roots invalid proofs utilizing powers and roots are often the following the fallacy that the rule generally valid only both and are positive when dealing with real which not the case although the fallacy easily detected sometimes concealed more effectively for consider the equation which holds consequence the pythagorean theorem then taking square that but evaluating this when implies which the error each these examples fundamentally lies the fact that any equation the form has two provided and essential check which these solutions relevant the problem the above the square root that allowed the second equation deduced from the first valid only when cos when set the second equation rendered another example this kind where the error immediately the following invalid proof that letting and then squaring gives whereupon taking square root implies that which clearly when the square root was was the negative root rather than the positive root that was relevant for the particular solution the alternatively imaginary roots are obfuscated the the error here lies the last where are ignoring the other fourth roots which are and where the imaginary unit seeing have squared our figure and then taken cannot always assume that all the roots will the correct fourth are and which are the imaginary numbers defined complex exponents when number raised complex the result not uniquely defined see failure power and logarithm identities this property not then errors such the following can the error here that the rule multiplying exponents when going the third line does not apply unmodified with complex even when putting both sides the power only the principal value when treated multivalued functions both sides produce the same set being geometry many mathematical fallacies geometry arise from using additive equality involving oriented quantities such adding vectors along given line adding oriented angles the valid but which fixes only the absolute value one these this quantity then incorporated into the equation with the wrong produce absurd this wrong orientation usually suggested implicitly supplying imprecise diagram the where relative positions points lines are chosen way that actually impossible under the hypotheses the but obviously such fallacy easy expose drawing precise picture the which some relative positions will different form those the provided order avoid such correct geometric argument using addition subtraction distances angles should always prove that quantities are being incorporated with their correct fallacy the isosceles triangle the fallacy the isosceles from maxwell chapter purports show that every triangle isosceles meaning that two sides the triangle are congruent this fallacy has been attributed lewis carroll given triangle prove that draw line bisecting call the midpoint line segment draw the perpendicular bisector segment which contains these two lines are parallel otherwise they intersect point draw line perpendicular line perpendicular draw lines and aas rao qao oaq oar since bisects aro aqo are both right sas odb odc odc are right because bisects rob qoc since rao since odb orb and oqc are right thus and one can show that all triangles are showing that and the same all but the last step the proof indeed correct those three pairs triangles are indeed the error the proof the assumption the diagram that the point inside the whenever lies outside the furthermore can shown longer than then will lie within while will lie outside and vice any diagram drawn with sufficiently accurate instruments will verify the above two because still but actually and thus the lengths are not necessarily the proof induction there exist several fallacious proofs induction which one the basis case inductive intuituvely proofs induction work arguing statement true one true the next and hence repeatedly applying this can shown true for all this proof shows that all horses are the same colour let say that any group horses all the same remove horse from the have group horses the same add another have another group our previous all the horses are the same colour this new since group thus have constructed two groups horses all the same with horses since these two groups have some horses the two groups must the same colour each therefore combining all the horses have group horses the same thus any horses are all the same any horses are the same this clearly true for one horse group where all the horses are the same thus horses are the same colour for any positive integer all horses are the same the fallacy this proof arises line for the two groups horses have horses and thus are not necessarily the same colour each the group horses not necessarily all the same the implication every horses are the same then horses are the same works for any greater than but fails true when the basis case but the induction step has fundamental see also list incomplete proofs paradox proof intimidation
