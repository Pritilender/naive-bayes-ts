the foundations mathematics and theoretical computer science the unifying themes mathematical logic include the study the expressive power formal systems and the deductive power formal proof systems mathematical logic often divided into the fields set theory model theory recursion theory and proof theory these areas share basic results particularly first order logic and definability computer science particularly the acm classification mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed this see logic computer science for since its mathematical logic has both contributed and has been motivated the study foundations mathematics this study began the late century with the development axiomatic frameworks for geometry arithmetic and analysis the early century was shaped david hilbert program prove the consistency foundational results kurt del gerhard gentzen and others provided partial resolution the and clarified the issues involved proving work set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can formalized terms although there are some theorems that cannot proven common axiom systems for set contemporary work the foundations mathematics often focuses establishing which parts mathematics can formalized particular formal systems reverse mathematics rather than trying find theories which all mathematics can contents subfields and scope history early

mathematical logic makes rough division contemporary mathematical logic into four set theory model theory recursion theory and proof theory and constructive mathematics considered parts single each area has distinct although many techniques and results are shared among multiple the borderlines amongst these and the lines separating mathematical logic and other fields are not always incompleteness theorem marks not only milestone recursion theory and proof but has also led theorem modal the method forcing employed set model and recursion well the study intuitionistic the mathematical field category theory uses many formal axiomatic and includes the study categorical logic but category theory not ordinarily considered subfield mathematical because its applicability diverse fields mathematicians including saunders mac lane have proposed category theory foundational system for independent set these foundations use toposes which resemble generalized models set theory that may employ classical nonclassical history mathematical logic emerged the century subfield mathematics independent the traditional study logic ferreir before this logic was studied with rhetoric through the syllogism and with philosophy the first half the century saw explosion fundamental accompanied vigorous debate over the foundations early history history logic theories logic were developed many cultures including china india greece and the islamic world century attempts treat the operations formal logic symbolic algebraic way had been made philosophical mathematicians including leibniz and lambert but their labors remained isolated and little century the middle the nineteenth george boole and then augustus morgan presented systematic mathematical treatments their building work algebraists such george peacock extended the traditional aristotelian doctrine logic into sufficient framework for the study foundations mathematics katz charles sanders peirce built upon the work boole develop logical system for relations and which published several papers from gottlob frege presented independent development logic with quantifiers his begriffsschrift published work generally considered marking turning point the history frege work remained however until bertrand russell began promote near the turn the the dimensional notation frege developed was never widely adopted and unused contemporary from ernst der published vorlesungen ber die algebra der logik three this work summarized and extended the work and and was comprehensive reference symbolic logic was understood the end the foundational theories concerns that mathematics had not been built proper foundation led the development axiomatic systems for fundamental areas mathematics such analysis and the term arithmetic refers the theory the natural numbers giuseppe peano published set axioms for arithmetic that came bear his name peano axioms using variation the logical system boole and der but adding peano was unaware work the around the same time richard dedekind showed that the natural numbers are uniquely characterized their induction properties dedekind proposed different which lacked the formal logical character dedekind however proved theorems inaccessible including the uniqueness the set natural numbers and the recursive definitions addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical the flaws axioms for geometry became known katz addition the independence the parallel postulate established nikolai lobachevsky lobachevsky mathematicians discovered that certain theorems taken for granted euclid were not fact provable from his among these the theorem that line contains least two that circles the same radius whose centers are separated that radius must hilbert developed complete set axioms for geometry building previous work pasch the success axiomatizing geometry motivated hilbert seek complete axiomatizations other areas such the natural numbers and the real line this would prove major area research the first half the the century saw great advances the theory real analysis including theories convergence functions and fourier series mathematicians such karl weierstrass began construct functions that stretched such nowhere differentiable continuous functions previous conceptions function rule for smooth were longer weierstrass began advocate the arithmetization analysis which sought axiomatize analysis using properties the natural the modern definition limit and continuous functions was already developed bolzano felscher but remained relatively cauchy defined continuity terms infinitesimals see cours page dedekind proposed definition the real numbers terms dedekind cuts rational numbers dedekind definition still employed contemporary georg cantor developed the fundamental concepts infinite set his early results developed the theory cardinality and proved that the reals and the natural numbers have different cardinalities cantor over the next twenty cantor developed theory transfinite numbers series published new proof the uncountability the real numbers that introduced the diagonal argument and used this method prove cantor theorem that set can have the same cardinality its powerset cantor believed that every set could well ordered but was unable produce proof for this leaving open problem katz century the early decades the the main areas study were set theory and formal the discovery paradoxes informal set theory caused some wonder whether mathematics itself and look for proofs hilbert posed famous list problems for the next the first two these were resolve the continuum hypothesis and prove the consistency elementary respectively the tenth was produce method that could decide whether multivariate polynomial equation over the integers has subsequent work resolve these problems shaped the direction mathematical did the effort resolve entscheidungsproblem posed this problem asked for procedure that would given formalized mathematical whether the statement true set theory and paradoxes ernst zermelo gave proof that every set could result georg cantor had been unable achieve the zermelo introduced the axiom choice which drew heated debate and research among mathematicians and the pioneers set the immediate criticism the method led zermelo publish second exposition his directly addressing criticisms his proof zermelo this paper led the general acceptance the axiom choice the mathematics skepticism about the axiom choice was reinforced recently discovered paradoxes naive set cesare forti was the first state the burali forti paradox shows that the collection all ordinal numbers cannot form very soon bertrand russell discovered russell paradox and jules richard discovered richard paradox zermelo provided the first set axioms for set these together with the additional axiom replacement proposed abraham fraenkel are now called zermelo fraenkel set theory zermelo axioms incorporated the principle limitation size avoid the first volume principia mathematica russell and alfred north whitehead was this seminal work developed the theory functions and cardinality completely formal framework type theory which russell and whitehead developed effort avoid the principia mathematica considered one the most influential works the although the framework type theory did not prove popular foundational theory for mathematics ferreir fraenkel proved that the axiom choice cannot proved from the remaining axioms set theory with urelements later work paul cohen showed that the addition urelements not and the axiom choice unprovable cohen proof developed the method forcing which now important tool for establishing independence results set symbolic logic leopold wenheim and thoralf skolem obtained the skolem theorem which says that order logic cannot control the cardinalities infinite skolem realized that this theorem would apply order formalizations set and that implies any such formalization has countable model this counterintuitive fact became known skolem paradox his doctoral kurt del proved the completeness theorem which establishes correspondence between syntax and semantics first order logic del used the completeness theorem prove the compactness theorem demonstrating the finitary nature order logical consequence these results helped establish order logic the dominant logic used del published formally undecidable propositions principia mathematica and related systems which proved the incompleteness different meaning the all sufficiently effective order this known incompleteness theorem establishes severe limitations axiomatic foundations for striking strong blow showed the impossibility providing consistency proof arithmetic within any formal theory hilbert however did not acknowledge the importance the incompleteness theorem for some theorem shows that consistency proof any sufficiently effective axiom system cannot obtained the system the system nor any weaker this leaves open the possibility consistency proofs that cannot formalized within the system they gentzen proved the consistency arithmetic using finitistic system together with principle transfinite induction gentzen result introduced the ideas cut elimination and proof theoretic ordinals which became key tools proof del gave different consistency which reduces the consistency classical arithmetic that intutitionistic arithmetic higher beginnings the other branches alfred tarski developed the basics model theory beginning group prominent mathematicians collaborated under the pseudonym nicolas bourbaki publish series encyclopedic mathematics these written austere and axiomatic emphasized rigorous presentation and theoretic terminology coined these such the words bijection injection and surjection and the theoretic foundations the texts were widely adopted throughout the study computability came known recursion because early formalizations del and kleene relied recursive definitions when these definitions were shown equivalent formalization involving turing became clear that new concept the computable function had been and that this definition was robust enough admit numerous independent his work the incompleteness theorems del lacked rigorous concept effective formal immediately realized that the new definitions computability could used for this allowing him state the incompleteness theorems generality that could only implied the original numerous results recursion theory were obtained the stephen cole kleene and emil leon post kleene introduced the concepts relative foreshadowed turing and the arithmetical hierarchy kleene later generalized recursion theory order kleene and kreisel studied formal versions intuitionistic particularly the context proof formal logical systems its mathematical logic deals with mathematical concepts expressed using formal logical systems these though they differ many share the common property considering only expressions fixed formal the systems propositional logic and first order logic are the most widely studied because their applicability foundations mathematics and because their desirable theoretic stronger classical logics such second order logic infinitary logic are also along with nonclassical logics such intuitionistic logic first order logic first order logic order logic particular formal system logic its syntax involves only finite expressions formed while its semantics are characterized the limitation all quantifiers fixed domain discourse early results from formal logic established limitations order the skolem theorem showed that set sentences countable order language has infinite model then has least one model each infinite this shows that impossible for set order axioms characterize the natural the real any other infinite structure isomorphism the goal early foundational studies was produce axiomatic theories for all parts this limitation was particularly completeness theorem del established the equivalence between semantic and syntactic definitions logical consequence order shows that particular sentence true every model that satisfies particular set then there must finite deduction the sentence from the the compactness theorem first appeared lemma proof the completeness and took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began apply says that set sentences has model and only every finite subset has other words that inconsistent set formulas must have finite inconsistent the completeness and compactness theorems allow for sophisticated analysis logical consequence order logic and the development model theory and they are key reason for the prominence order logic incompleteness theorems del establish additional limits order the first incompleteness theorem states that for any sufficiently effectively given logical system there exists statement which true but not provable within that here logical system effectively given possible given any formula the language the whether the formula logical system sufficiently strong can express the peano axioms when applied order the first incompleteness theorem implies that any sufficiently consistent effective order theory has models that are not elementarily equivalent stronger limitation than the one established the skolem the second incompleteness theorem states that sufficiently consistent effective axiom system for arithmetic can prove its own which has been interpreted show that program cannot other classical logics many logics besides order logic are these include infinitary logics which allow for formulas provide infinite amount and higher order logics which include portion set theory directly their the most well studied infinitary logic this quantifiers may only nested finite order but formulas may have finite countably infinite conjunctions and disjunctions within thus for possible say that object whole number using formula such order logics allow for quantification not only elements the domain but subsets the domain sets such and other objects higher the semantics are defined rather than having separate domain for each type quantifier range the quantifiers instead range over all objects the appropriate the logics studied before the development order for example had similar theoretic although order logics are more allowing complete axiomatizations structures such the natural they not satisfy analogues the completeness and compactness theorems from order and are thus less amenable theoretic another type logics are fixed point logics that allow inductive definitions like one writes for primitive recursive functions one can formally define extension order logic notion which encompasses all logics this section because they behave like order logic certain fundamental but does not encompass all logics does not encompass modal fuzzy logic lindstr theorem implies that the only extension order logic satisfying both the compactness theorem and the downward skolem theorem order nonclassical and modal logic modal logics include additional modal such operator which states that particular formula not only but necessarily although modal logic not often used axiomatize has been used study the properties order provability solovay and theoretic forcing hamkins and intuitionistic logic was developed heyting study program which brouwer himself avoided intuitionistic logic specifically does not include the law the excluded middle which states that each sentence either true its negation kleene work with the proof theory intuitionistic logic showed that constructive information can recovered from intuitionistic for any provably total function intuitionistic arithmetic computable this not true classical theories arithmetic such peano arithmetic algebraic logic algebraic logic uses the methods abstract algebra study the semantics formal fundamental example the use boolean algebras represent truth values classical propositional and the use heyting algebras represent truth values intuitionistic propositional stronger such order logic and order are studied using more complicated algebraic structures such cylindric algebras set theory set theory set theory the study sets which are abstract collections many the basic such ordinal and cardinal were developed informally cantor before formal axiomatizations set theory were the first such due zermelo was extended slightly become zermelo fraenkel set theory which now the most widely used foundational theory for other formalizations set theory have been including von del set theory morse kelley set theory and new foundations nbg and are similar describing cumulative hierarchy new foundations takes different allows objects such the set all sets the cost restrictions its existence the system kripke platek set theory closely related generalized recursion two famous statements set theory are the axiom choice and the continuum hypothesis the axiom first stated zermelo was proved independent fraenkel but has come widely accepted states that given collection nonempty sets there single set that contains exactly one element from each set the the set said choose one element from each set the while the ability make such choice considered obvious since each set the collection the lack concrete rule which the choice can made renders the axiom stefan banach and alfred tarski showed that the axiom choice can used decompose solid ball into finite number pieces which can then with make two solid balls the original this known the banach tarski paradox one many counterintuitive results the axiom the continuum first proposed conjecture was listed david hilbert one his problems del showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot disproven from the axioms fraenkel set theory with without the axiom developing the constructible universe set theory which the continuum hypothesis must paul cohen showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot proven from the axioms fraenkel set theory cohen this independence result did not completely settle however possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the recent work along these lines has been conducted hugh woodin although its importance not yet clear woodin contemporary research set theory includes the study large cardinals and determinacy large cardinals are cardinal numbers with particular properties strong that the existence such cardinals cannot proved the existence the smallest large cardinal typically inaccessible cardinal already implies the consistency despite the fact that large cardinals have extremely high cardinality their existence has many ramifications for the structure the real determinacy refers the possible existence winning strategies for certain player games the games are said determined the existence these strategies implies structural properties the real line and other polish spaces model theory model theory model theory studies the models various formal here theory set formulas particular formal logic and signature while model structure that gives concrete interpretation the model theory closely related universal algebra and algebraic geometry although the methods model theory focus more logical considerations than those the set all models particular theory called elementary class classical model theory seeks determine the properties models particular elementary determine whether certain classes structures form elementary the method quantifier elimination can used show that definable sets particular theories cannot too tarski established quantifier elimination for real closed fields result which also shows the theory the field real numbers decidable also noted that his methods were equally applicable algebraically closed fields arbitrary modern subfield developing from this concerned with minimal structures morley categoricity theorem proved michael morley states that order theory countable language categorical some uncountable all models this cardinality are then categorical all uncountable trivial consequence the continuum hypothesis that complete theory with less than continuum many nonisomorphic countable models can have only countably vaught conjecture named after robert lawson vaught says that this true even independently the continuum many special cases this conjecture have been recursion theory recursion theory recursion theory also called computability theory studies the properties computable functions and the turing degrees which divide the uncomputable functions into sets which have the same level recursion theory also includes the study generalized computability and recursion theory grew from the work alonzo church and alan turing the which was greatly extended kleene and post the classical recursion theory focuses the computability functions from the natural numbers the natural the fundamental results establish canonical class computable functions with numerous equivalent characterizations using turing machines calculus and other more advanced results concern the structure the turing degrees and the lattice recursively enumerable sets generalized recursion theory extends the ideas recursion theory computations that are longer necessarily includes the study computability higher types well areas such hyperarithmetical theory and recursion theory contemporary research recursion theory includes the study applications such algorithmic randomness computable model theory and reverse mathematics well new results pure recursion algorithmically unsolvable problems important subfield recursion theory studies algorithmic decision problem function problem algorithmically unsolvable there possible computable algorithm which returns the correct answer for all legal inputs the the first results about obtained independently church and turing showed that the entscheidungsproblem algorithmically turing proved this establishing the unsolvability the halting problem result with ranging implications both recursion theory and computer there are many known examples undecidable problems from ordinary the word problem for groups was proved algorithmically unsolvable pyotr novikov and independently boone the busy beaver problem developed tibor another known hilbert tenth problem asked for algorithm determine whether multivariate polynomial equation with integer coefficients has solution the partial progress was made julia robinson martin davis and hilary putnam the algorithmic unsolvability the problem was proved yuri matiyasevich davis proof theory and constructive mathematics proof theory proof theory the study formal proofs various logical deduction these proofs are represented formal mathematical facilitating their analysis mathematical several deduction systems are commonly including hilbert style deduction systems systems natural deduction and the sequent calculus developed the study constructive mathematics the context mathematical includes the study systems classical logic such intuitionistic well the study predicative systems early proponent predicativism was hermann weyl who showed possible develop large part real analysis using only predicative methods weyl because proofs are entirely whereas truth structure common for work constructive mathematics emphasize the relationship between provability classical systems and provability intuitionistic respectively systems particular results such the gentzen negative translation show that possible embed translate classical logic into intuitionistic allowing some properties about intuitionistic proofs transferred back classical recent developments proof theory include the study proof mining ulrich kohlenbach and the study proof theoretic ordinals michael connections with computer science logic computer science the study computability theory computer science closely related the study computability mathematical there difference however computer scientists often focus concrete programming languages and feasible computability while researchers mathematical logic often focus computability theoretical concept and the theory semantics programming languages related model theory program verification model checking the curry howard isomorphism between proofs and programs relates proof theory especially intuitionistic logic formal calculi such the lambda calculus and combinatory logic are now studied idealized programming languages computer science also contributes mathematics developing techniques for the automatic checking even finding such automated theorem proving and logic programming descriptive complexity theory relates logics computational complexity the first significant result this fagin theorem established that precisely the set languages expressible sentences existential second order logic foundations mathematics foundations mathematics the mathematicians became aware logical gaps and inconsistencies their was shown that euclid axioms for which had been taught for centuries example the axiomatic were the use infinitesimals and the very definition function came into question pathological examples such nowhere differentiable continuous function were cantor study arbitrary infinite sets also drew leopold kronecker famously stated god made the all else the work endorsing return the study concrete objects although argument was carried forward constructivists the the mathematical community whole rejected david hilbert argued favor the study the saying one shall expel from the paradise that cantor has mathematicians began search for axiom systems that could used formalize large parts addition removing ambiguity from previously naive terms such was hoped that this axiomatization would allow for consistency the the main method proving the consistency set axioms was provide model for thus for non euclidean geometry can proved consistent defining point mean point fixed sphere and line mean great circle the the resulting model elliptic geometry satisfies the axioms plane geometry except the parallel with the development formal hilbert asked whether would possible prove that axiom system consistent analyzing the structure possible proofs the and showing through this analysis that impossible prove this idea led the study proof theory moreover hilbert proposed that the analysis should entirely using the term finitary refer the methods would allow but not precisely defining this known hilbert program was seriously affected incompleteness which show that the consistency formal theories arithmetic cannot established using methods formalizable those gentzen showed that possible produce proof the consistency arithmetic finitary system augmented with axioms transfinite induction and the techniques developed were seminal proof second thread the history foundations mathematics involves nonclassical logics and constructive mathematics the study constructive mathematics includes many different programs with various definitions constructive the most accommodating proofs set theory that not use the axiom choice are called constructive many more limited versions constructivism limit themselves natural numbers number theoretic functions and sets natural numbers which can used represent real facilitating the study mathematical analysis common idea that concrete means computing the values the function must known before the function itself can said the early luitzen egbertus jan brouwer founded intuitionism philosophy this poorly understood stated that order for mathematical statement true that person must able intuit the not only believe its truth but understand the reason for its consequence this definition truth was the rejection the law the excluded middle for there are statements according could not claimed true while their negations also could not claimed brouwer philosophy was and the cause bitter disputes among prominent later kleene and kreisel would study formalized versions intuitionistic logic brouwer rejected and presented his work unformalized natural
