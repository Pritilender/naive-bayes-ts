mathematics	mathematical proof proof navigation search elements mathematics proof deductive argument for mathematical statement the argument other previously established such theorems can proof can traced back evident assumed known axioms proofs are examples deductive reasoning and are distinguished from inductive empirical arguments proof must demonstrate that statement always true occasionally listing all possible cases and showing that holds rather than enumerate many confirmatory unproven statement that believed true known conjecture proofs employ logic but usually include some amount natural language which usually admits some the vast majority proofs written mathematics can considered applications rigorous informal logic purely formal proofs written symbolic language instead natural are considered proof theory the distinction between formal and informal proofs has led much examination current and historical mathematical practice quasi empiricism mathematics and called folk mathematics both senses that the philosophy mathematics concerned with the role language and logic and mathematics language contents history and etymology nature and purpose methods proof direct

sources external links history and etymology history logic the word proof comes from the latin probare meaning related modern words are the english probe probation and probability the spanish probar smell lesser touch italian provare and the german probieren the early use probity was the presentation legal person such was said have whereby the evidence was his relative which outweighed empirical plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical likely that the idea demonstrating conclusion first arose connection with geometry which originally meant the same land the development mathematical proof primarily the product ancient greek mathematics and one its greatest thales bce proved some theorems eudoxus bce and theaetetus bce formulated theorems but did not prove aristotle bce said definitions should describe the concept being defined terms other concepts already mathematical proofs were revolutionized euclid bce who introduced the axiomatic method still use starting with undefined terms and axioms propositions regarding the undefined terms assumed evidently true from the greek axios meaning something and used these prove theorems using deductive logic his the elements was read anyone who was considered educated the west until the middle the addition the familiar theorems such the pythagorean theorem the elements includes proof that the square root two irrational and that there are infinitely many prime further advances took place medieval islamic mathematics while earlier greek proofs were largely geometric the development arithmetic and algebra islamic mathematicians allowed more general proofs that longer depended the century the iraqi mathematician hashimi provided general proofs for numbers rather than geometric considered division etc for used this method provide proof the existence irrational numbers inductive proof for arithmetic sequences was introduced the fakhri karaji who used prove the binomial theorem and properties pascal triangle alhazen also developed the method proof contradiction the first attempt proving the euclidean parallel postulate modern proof theory treats proofs inductively defined data there longer assumption that axioms are true any this allows for parallel mathematical theories built alternate sets axioms see axiomatic set theory and non euclidean geometry for nature and purpose proof expressed natural language and rigorous argument intended convince the audience the truth the standard rigor not absolute and has varied throughout proof can presented differently depending the intended order gain proof has meet communal statements argument considered vague incomplete may the concept proof formalized the field mathematical formal proof written formal language instead natural formal proof defined sequence formulas formal which each formula logical consequence preceding having definition formal proof makes the concept proof amenable indeed the field proof theory studies formal proofs and their for the property that statement has formal application proof theory show that certain undecidable statements are not the definition formal proof intended capture the concept proofs written the practice the soundness this definition amounts the belief that published proof converted into formal however outside the field automated proof this rarely done classic question philosophy asks whether mathematical proofs are analytic synthetic kant who introduced the analytic synthetic distinction believed mathematical proofs are proofs may viewed aesthetic admired for their mathematical beauty the mathematician paul was known for describing proofs found particularly elegant coming from the hypothetical tome containing the most beautiful proving each the book proofs from the book published devoted presenting proofs its editors find particularly methods proof direct proof direct proof direct the conclusion established logically combining the definitions and earlier for direct proof can used establish that the sum two even integers always this proof uses the definition even the integer properties closure under addition and and distributivity proof mathematical induction mathematical induction mathematical induction not form inductive reasoning proof mathematical single base and induction which establishes that certain case implies the next applying the induction rule starting from the independently proved base proves often infinitely many other since the base case the infinity other cases must also even all them cannot proved directly because their infinite subset induction infinite descent infinite descent can used prove the irrationality the square root two common application proof mathematical induction prove that property known hold for one number holds for all natural let the set natural and mathematical statement involving the natural number belonging such that true for true whenever true implies that then true for all natural numbers for can prove induction that all integers the form are thus common for the phrase proof used for proof mathematical proof contraposition contraposition proof contraposition infers the conclusion then from the premise not then not the statement not then not called the contrapositive the statement then for contraposition can used establish given integer then proof contradiction proof contradiction proof contradiction also known reductio absurdum latin for reduction the shown that some statement were logical contradiction hence the statement must famous example proof contradiction shows that irrational number common factor proof construction proof construction proof proof the construction concrete example with property show that something having that property joseph liouville for proved the existence transcendental numbers constructing explicit example can also used construct counterexample disprove proposition that all elements have certain proof exhaustion proof exhaustion proof the conclusion established dividing into finite number cases and proving each one the number cases sometimes can become very for the first proof the four color theorem was proof exhaustion with cases this proof was controversial because the majority the cases were checked computer not the shortest known proof the four color theorem still has over cases probabilistic proof probabilistic method probabilistic proof one which example shown with using methods probability theory probabilistic like proof one many ways show existence theorems this not confused with argument that theorem true plausibility the work the collatz conjecture shows how far plausibility from genuine combinatorial proof combinatorial proof combinatorial proof establishes the equivalence different expressions showing that they count the same object different often bijection between two sets used show that the expressions for their two sizes are alternatively double counting argument provides two different expressions for the size single again showing that the two expressions are nonconstructive proof nonconstructive proof nonconstructive proof establishes that mathematical object with certain property exists without explaining how such object can often this takes the form proof contradiction which the nonexistence the object proven constructive proof establishes that particular object exists providing method finding famous example nonconstructive proof shows that there exist two irrational numbers and such that rational number statistical proofs pure mathematics statistical proof the expression statistical may used technically colloquially areas pure mathematics such involving cryptography chaotic series and probabilistic analytic number theory less commonly used refer mathematical proof the branch mathematics known mathematical statistics see also statistical proof using data section computer assisted proofs computer assisted proof until the twentieth century was assumed that any proof checked competent mathematician confirm its however computers are now used both prove theorems and carry out calculations that are too long for any human team humans the first proof the four color theorem example assisted some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility error computer program time error its calculations calls the validity such assisted proofs into the chances error invalidating assisted proof can reduced incorporating redundancy and checks into and developing multiple independent approaches and errors can never completely ruled out case verification proof humans especially the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical undecidable statements statement that neither provable nor disprovable from set axioms called undecidable from those one example the parallel postulate which neither provable nor refutable from the remaining axioms euclidean geometry mathematicians have shown there are many statements that are neither provable nor disprovable zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom choice the standard system set theory mathematics assuming that zfc see list statements undecidable zfc incompleteness theorem shows that many axiom systems mathematical interest will have undecidable heuristic mathematics and experimental mathematics experimental mathematics while early mathematicians such eudoxus cnidus did not use from euclid the foundational mathematics developments the late and proofs were essential part with the increase computing power the significant work began done investigating mathematical objects outside the theorem experimental mathematics early pioneers these methods intended the work ultimately embedded classical theorem the early development fractal geometry which was ultimately related concepts visual proof although not formal visual demonstration mathematical theorem sometimes called proof without words the hand picture below example historic visual proof the pythagorean theorem the case the triangle visual proof for the triangle the chou pei suan ching animated visual proof for the pythagorean theorem second animated proof the

which actually bend which are unnoticeable until the entire picture closely with lengths and angles precisely measured elementary proof elementary proof elementary proof proof which only uses basic more the term used number theory refer proofs that make use complex analysis for some time was thought that certain like the prime number theorem could only proved using higher mathematics however over many these results have been reproved using only elementary two column proof particular way organising proof using two parallel columns often used elementary geometry classes the united the proof
