measure measure theory navigation search measuring coalgebra monotone subset empty set mathematical analysis measure set systematic way assign number each suitable subset that intuitively interpreted its this measure generalization the concepts area and particularly important example the lebesgue measure euclidean space which assigns the conventional length area and volume euclidean geometry suitable subsets the dimensional euclidean space for the lebesgue measure the interval the real numbers its length the everyday sense the technically measure function that assigns negative real number subsets set see definition below must assign the empty set and countably additive the measure subset that can decomposed into finite number disjoint the sum the measures the smaller subsets one wants associate consistent size each subset given set while satisfying the other axioms one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure this problem was resolved defining measure only collection all the called measurable subsets which are required form algebra this means that countable unions countable intersections and complements measurable subsets are non measurable sets euclidean which the lebesgue measure cannot defined are necessarily complicated the sense being badly mixed with their indeed their existence trivial consequence the axiom choice measure theory was developed successive stages during the late and early centuries mile borel henri lebesgue johann radon and maurice chet among the main applications measures are the foundations the lebesgue integral andrey kolmogorov axiomatisation probability theory and ergodic theory integration specifying measure allows one define integrals spaces more general than subsets euclidean moreover the integral with respect the lebesgue measure euclidean spaces more general and has richer theory than its the riemann integral probability theory considers measures that assign the whole set the size and considers measurable subsets events whose probability given the ergodic theory considers measures that are invariant arise naturally dynamical system contents definition properties monotonicity measures infinite unions measurable sets measures infinite intersections measurable sets sigma finite measures completeness additivity examples non measurable sets generalizations see also references bibliography external links definition let set and algebra over function from the extended real number line called measure satisfies the following non negativity for all null empty set countable additivity additivity for all countable collections pairwise disjoint sets one may require that least one set has finite then the null set automatically has measure zero because countable because only the second and third conditions the definition measure above are and takes most one the values then called signed measure the pair called measurable space the members are called measurable sets and are two measurable then function called measurable for every measurable set the inverse image the composition measurable functions making the measurable spaces and measurable functions category with the measurable spaces objects and the set measurable functions triple called measure space probability measure measure with total measure probability space measure space with probability for measure spaces that are also topological spaces various compatibility conditions can placed for the measure and the most measures met practice analysis and many cases also probability theory are radon measures radon measures have alternative definition terms linear functionals the locally convex space continuous functions with compact support this approach taken bourbaki and number other for more see the article radon measures properties several further properties can derived from the definition countably additive monotonicity measure monotonic and are measurable sets with then measures infinite unions measurable sets measure countably subadditive for any countable sequence sets not necessarily measure continuous from are measurable sets and subset for all then the union the sets and measures infinite intersections measurable sets measure continuous from are measurable sets and for all then the intersection the sets furthermore least one the has finite then this property false without the assumption that least one the has finite for for each let which all have infinite lebesgue but the intersection sigma finite measures sigma finite measure measure space called finite finite real number rather than nonzero finite measures are analogous probability measures the sense that any finite measure proportional the probability measure measure called finite can decomposed into countable union measurable sets finite analogously set measure space said have finite measure countable union sets with finite for the real numbers with the standard lebesgue measure are finite but not consider the closed intervals for all integers there are countably many such each has measure and their union the entire real alternatively consider the real numbers with the counting measure which assigns each finite set reals the number points the this measure space not because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many and would take uncountably many such sets cover the entire real the finite measure spaces have some very convenient finiteness can compared this respect the lindel property topological they can also thought vague generalization the idea that measure space may have uncountable completeness complete measure measurable set called null set subset null set called negligible set negligible set need not but every measurable negligible set automatically null measure called complete every negligible set measure can extended complete one considering the algebra subsets which differ negligible set from measurable set that such that the symmetric difference and contained null one defines equal additivity measures are required countably however the condition can strengthened for any set and any set nonnegative define that define the sum the the supremum all the sums finitely many measure additive for any and any family the following note that the second condition equivalent the statement that the ideal null sets examples some important measures are listed the counting measure defined number elements the lebesgue measure complete translation invariant measure algebra containing the intervals such that and every other measure with these properties extends lebesgue circular angle measure invariant under rotation and hyperbolic angle measure invariant under squeeze mapping the haar measure for locally compact topological group generalization the lebesgue measure and also counting measure and circular angle and has similar uniqueness the hausdorff measure generalization the lebesgue measure sets with integer fractal every probability space gives rise measure which takes the value the whole space and therefore takes all its values the unit interval such measure called probability measure see probability axioms the dirac measure dirac delta function given where the characteristic function the measure set contains the point and otherwise other measures used various theories borel measure jordan measure ergodic measure euler measure gaussian measure baire measure radon measure and young measure physics example measure spatial distribution mass see gravity potential another negative extensive property conserved see conservation law for list negative values lead signed see generalizations below liouville measure known also the natural volume form symplectic useful classical statistical and hamiltonian gibbs measure widely used statistical often under the name canonical ensemble non measurable sets non measurable set the axiom choice assumed not all subsets euclidean space are lebesgue measurable examples such sets include the vitali set and the measurable sets postulated the hausdorff paradox and the banach tarski paradox generalizations for certain useful have measure whose values are not restricted the negative reals for countably additive set function with values the real numbers called signed measure while such function with values the complex numbers called complex measure measures that take values banach spaces have been studied citation needed measure that takes values the set adjoint projections hilbert space called projection valued measure these are used functional analysis for the spectral theorem when necessary distinguish the usual measures which take negative values from the term positive measure positive measures are closed under conical combination but not general linear combination while signed measures are the linear closure positive another generalization the finitely additive measure which are sometimes called contents this the same measure except that instead requiring countable additivity require only finite additivity historically this definition was used turns out that finitely additive measures are connected with notions such banach limits the dual and the stone ech compactification all these are linked one way another the axiom choice charge generalization both finitely signed see also abelian von neumann algebra almost everywhere extension theorem theorem fuzzy measure theory
