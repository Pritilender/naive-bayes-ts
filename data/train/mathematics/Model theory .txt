techniques model theory higher order logics infinitary logics hampered the fact that completeness does not general hold for these however great deal study has also been done such informally model theory can divided into classical model model theory applied groups and and geometric model missing subdivision computable model theory but this can arguably viewed independent subfield examples early

evolution classical model theory occurred with the birth stability theory through morley theorem uncountably categorical theories and shelah classification which developed calculus independence and rank based syntactical conditions satisfied during the last several decades applied model theory has repeatedly merged with the more pure stability the result this synthesis called geometric model theory this article which taken include for well classical geometric stability example theorem from geometric model theory hrushovski proof the mordell lang conjecture for function the ambition geometric model theory provide geography mathematics embarking detailed study definable sets various mathematical aided the substantial tools developed the study pure model universal algebra universal algebra fundamental concepts universal algebra are signatures and since these concepts are formally defined the article structures the present article can content itself with informal introduction which consists examples how these terms are binary unary nullary ring group identities monoid semigroup magma this very efficient way define most classes algebraic structures because there also the concept homomorphism which correctly specializes the usual notions homomorphism for semigroups magmas and for this the signature must chosen terms such the term given are used define identities but also construct free algebras equational class class structures like the examples above and many defined the class all structures which satisfy certain set birkhoff theorem states important trivial tool universal algebra are ultraproducts where infinite set indexing system structures and ultrafilter while model theory generally considered part mathematical logic universal which grew out alfred north whitehead work abstract algebra part algebra this reflected their respective msc classifications nevertheless model theory can seen extension universal finite model theory finite model theory finite model theory the area model theory which has the closest ties universal algebra like some parts universal and contrast with the other areas model mainly concerned with finite algebras more with finite structures for signatures which may contain relation symbols the following graph homomorphism map that commutes with the operations and preserves the relations this definition gives rise the usual notion graph homomorphism which has the interesting property that bijective homomorphism need not structures are also part universal after some algebraic structures such ordered groups have binary relation what distinguishes finite model theory from universal algebra its use more general logical sentences the example place theoretic context identity written sentence the logics employed finite model theory are often substantially more expressive than first order logic the standard logic for model theory infinite first order logic first order logic whereas universal algebra provides the semantics for signature logic provides the syntax with identities and quasi identities even universal algebra has some limited syntactic first order logic the result making quantification explicit and adding negation into the order formula built out atomic formulas such means the boolean connectives and prefixing quantifiers sentence formula which each occurrence variable the scope corresponding examples for formulas are mark the fact that most unbound variable and defined note that the equality symbol has double meaning intuitively clear how translate such formulas into mathematical the structure the natural for element satisfies the formula and only prime the formula similarly defines tarski gave rigorous sometimes called definition for the satisfaction relation that one easily set sentences called theory theory satisfiable has model structure the appropriate which satisfies all the sentences the set consistency theory usually defined syntactical but order logic the completeness theorem there need distinguish between satisfiability and therefore model theorists often use consistent synonym for satisfiable theory called categorical determines structure but turns out that this definition not due serious restrictions the expressivity order the skolem theorem implies that for every theory which has infinite model and for every infinite cardinal number there model such that the number elements exactly therefore only finitary structures can described categorical lack expressivity when compared higher logics such second order logic has its though for model the skolem theorem important practical tool rather than the source skolem paradox certain sense made precise lindstr theorem first order logic the most expressive logic for which both the skolem theorem and the compactness theorem corollary its the compactness theorem says that every unsatisfiable order theory has finite unsatisfiable this theorem central importance infinite model where the words are one way prove means ultraproducts alternative proof uses the completeness which otherwise reduced marginal role most modern model axiomatizability elimination and completeness the first often for applying the methods model theory class mathematical objects such trees the sense graph choose signature and represent the objects the next step show that the class elementary class axiomatizable order logic there theory such that structure the class and only satisfies this step fails for the since connectedness cannot expressed order axiomatizability ensures that model theory can speak about the right quantifier elimination can seen condition which ensures that model theory does not say too much about the theory has quantifier elimination every order formula over its signature equivalent modulo order formula without holds all models for example the theory algebraically closed fields the signature has quantifier elimination because every formula equivalent boolean combination equations between substructure structure subset its closed under all functions its signature which regarded structure restricting all functions and relations the embedding structure into another structure map between the domains which can written isomorphism with substructure every embedding injective homomorphism but the converse holds only the signature contains relation theory does not have quantifier one can add additional symbols its signature that early model theory spent much effort proving axiomatizability and quantifier elimination results for specific especially but often instead quantifier elimination weaker property theory called model complete every substructure model which itself model elementary there useful criterion for testing whether substructure elementary called the tarski vaught test follows from this criterion that theory complete and only every order formula over its signature equivalent modulo existential order formula the following where quantifier theory that not complete may may not have model completion which related complete theory that extension the original more general notion that model companions categoricity observed the section first order logic first order theories cannot they cannot describe unique model unless that model but two famous theoretic theorems deal with the weaker notion categoricity for cardinal theory called categorical any two models that are cardinality are turns out that the question categoricity depends critically whether bigger than the cardinality the language where the cardinality the for finite countable signatures this means that there fundamental difference between cardinality and cardinality for uncountable few characterizations categoricity include for every natural number the stone space for every natural number the number formulas free equivalence modulo this due independently engeler ryll nardzewski and svenonius sometimes referred the ryll nardzewski theorem further categorical theories and their countable models have strong ties with oligomorphic groups they are often constructed fra limits michael morley highly trivial result that for countable there only one notion uncountable categoricity was the starting point for modern model and particular classification theory and stability morley categoricity theorem uncountably categorical categorical for all uncountable cardinals theories are from many points view the most behaved theory that both categorical and uncountably categorical called totally categorical model theory and set theory set theory which expressed countable language has countable this known skolem paradox since there are sentences set theory which postulate the existence uncountable sets and yet these sentences are true our countable particularly the proof the independence the continuum hypothesis requires considering sets models which appear uncountable when viewed from within the but are countable someone outside the the theoretic viewpoint has been useful set theory for example kurt work the constructible which along with the method forcing developed paul cohen can shown prove the again philosophically independence the axiom choice and the continuum hypothesis from the other axioms set the other model theory itself can formalized within zfc set the development the fundamentals model theory such the compactness rely the axiom more exactly the boolean prime ideal other results model theory depend theoretic axioms beyond the standard zfc for the continuum hypothesis holds then every countable model has ultrapower which saturated its own similarly the generalized continuum hypothesis holds then every model has saturated elementary neither these results are provable zfc finally some questions arising from model theory such compactness for infinitary have been shown equivalent large cardinal other basic notions model theory reducts and expansions reduct field vector space can regarded group simply ignoring some its the corresponding notion model theory that reduct structure subset the original the opposite relation called expansion the group the rational numbers regarded structure the signature can expanded field with the signature ordered group with the signature similarly signature that extends another signature then complete theory can restricted intersecting the set its sentences with the set conversely complete theory can regarded and one can extend more than one complete the terms reduct and expansion are sometimes applied this relation interpretability interpretation model given mathematical there are very often associated structures which can constructed quotient part the original structure via equivalence important example quotient group one might say that understand the full structure one must understand these when the equivalence relation can give the previous sentence precise say that these structures are interpretable key fact that one can translate sentences from the language the interpreted structures the language the original thus one can show that structure interprets another whose theory undecidable then itself using the compactness and completeness theorems completeness theorem not confused with his incompleteness theorems says that theory has model and only consistent contradiction proved the this the heart model theory lets answer questions about theories looking models and one should not confuse the completeness theorem with the notion complete complete theory theory that contains every sentence its importantly one can find complete consistent theory extending any consistent however shown incompleteness theorems only relatively simple cases will possible have complete consistent theory that also recursive that can described recursively enumerable set the theory natural numbers has recursive complete and consistent non recursive theories are little practical since undecidable proposed axiom indeed making checking supertask the compactness theorem states that set sentences satisfiable every finite subset the context proof theory the analogous statement since every proof can have only finite number antecedents used the the context model however this proof somewhat more there are two well known one del which goes via and one malcev which more direct and allows restrict the cardinality the resulting model theory usually concerned with first order logic and many important results such the completeness and compactness fail second order logic other order logic all infinite cardinals look the same language which countable this expressed the skolem theorems which state that any countable theory with infinite model has models all infinite cardinalities least that the which agree with all they are elementarily equivalent types type model fix structure and natural number the set definable subsets over some parameters boolean algebra stone representation theorem for boolean algebras there natural dual notion one can consider this the topological space consisting maximal consistent sets formulae over call this the space types over and write now consider element then the set all formulae with parameters free variables that consistent and maximal called the type over one can show that for any type there exists some elementary extension and some that the type over many important properties model theory can expressed with further many proofs via constructing models with elements that contain elements with certain types and then using these illustrative suppose algebraically closed field the theory has quantifier elimination this allows show that type determined exactly the polynomial equations thus the space types over subfield bijective with the set prime ideals the polynomial ring this the same set the spectrum note however that the topology considered the type space the constructible topology set types basic open iff the form the form this finer than the zariski topology history model theory subject has existed since approximately the middle the however some earlier especially mathematical logic often regarded being theoretical nature
