morse theory navigation search morse redirects another morse can also mean anharmonic see morse potential differential topology morse theory enables one analyze the topology manifold studying differentiable functions that according the basic insights marston morse typical differentiable function manifold will reflect the topology quite morse theory allows one find structures and handle decompositions manifolds and obtain substantial information about their homology before arthur cayley and james clerk maxwell had developed some the ideas morse theory the context topography morse originally applied his theory geodesics critical points the energy functional these techniques were used raoul bott proof his periodicity theorem the analogue morse theory for complex manifolds picard lefschetz theory contents basic concepts formal development morse lemma fundamental theorems morse inequalities morse homology morse bott theory see also notes references basic concepts consider for purposes mountainous landscape the function sending each point its then the inverse image point level set simply contour line each connected component contour line either simple closed curve closed curve with double point contour lines may also have points higher order triple etc but these are unstable and may removed slight deformation the double points contour lines occur saddle points saddle points are points where the surrounding landscape curves one direction and down the imagine flooding this landscape with then the region covered water when the water reaches elevation the points with elevation less than equal consider how the topology this region changes the water intuitively that does not change except when passes the height critical point that point where the gradient that the jacobian matrix acting linear map from the tangent space that point the tangent space its image under the map does not have maximal other does not change except when the water either starts filling covers saddle mountain pass submerges each these three types critical points basins passes and peaks also called saddles and one associates number called the intuitively the index critical point the number independent directions around which decreases therefore the indices passes and peaks are and respectively rigorously index critical point the dimension the definite submatrix the hessian matrix calculated that point case smooth the hessian matrix turns out diagonal matrix define leaving the context one can make similar analysis how the topology changes increases when torus oriented the image and projection vertical taking point its height above the starting from the bottom the let and the four critical points index and respectively when less than the empty after passes the level when then disk which homotopy equivalent point which has been attached the empty next when exceeds the level and then and homotopy equivalent disk with cell attached image once passes the level and then torus with disk which homotopy equivalent cylinder with cell attached image finally when greater than the critical level the same torus with disk removed with disk attached one therefore appears have the following the topology does not change except when passes the height critical and when passes the height critical point index cell attached this does not address the question what happens when two critical points are the same that situation can resolved slight perturbation the case landscape manifold embedded euclidean space this perturbation might simply tilting the landscape rotating the coordinate this however false see let and let then critical point but the topology does not change when passes the concept index does not make the problem that the second derivative also this kind situation called degenerate critical note that this situation rotating the coordinate system under the the degenerate critical point either removed breaks into two degenerate critical formal development for valued smooth function differentiable manifold the points where the differential vanishes are called critical points and their images under are called critical values critical point the matrix second partial derivatives the hessian matrix then called non degenerate critical point the hessian singular then degenerate critical point for the functions from has critical point the origin which degenerate the form and degenerate the form less trivial example degenerate critical point the origin the monkey saddle the index degenerate critical point the dimension the largest subspace the tangent space which the hessian negative this corresponds the intuitive notion that the index the number directions which decreases the degeneracy and index critical point are independent the choice the local coordinate system shown sylvester law morse lemma let degenerate critical point then there exists chart neighborhood such that for all and throughout here equal the index corollary the morse one sees that degenerate critical points are isolated regarding extension the complex domain see complex morse lemma for see morse palais lemma fundamental theorems smooth valued function manifold morse function has degenerate critical basic result morse theory says that almost all functions are morse technically the morse functions form dense subset all smooth functions the topology this sometimes expressed typical function generic function indicated are interested the question when the topology changes varies half the answer this question given the following theorem compact diffeomorphic deformation retracts also interest know how the topology changes when passes critical the following theorem answers that theorem homotopy equivalent these results generalize and formalize the stated the previous was the rule stated these theorems correct using the two previous results and the fact that there exists morse function any differentiable one can prove that any differentiable manifold complex with cell for each critical point index one needs the technical fact that one can arrange have single critical point each critical which usually proven using gradient like vector fields rearrange the critical morse inequalities morse theory can used prove some strong results the homology the number critical points index equal the number cells the structure obtained from climbing using the fact that the alternating sum the ranks the homology groups topological space equal the alternating sum the ranks the chain groups from which the homology then using the cellular chain groups see cellular homology clear that the euler characteristic equal the sum where the number critical points index also cellular the rank the homology group complex less than equal the number cells therefore the rank the homology the betti number less than equal the number critical points index morse function these facts can strengthened obtain the morse inequalities for any one has this gives powerful tool study manifold suppose closed manifold there exists morse function with precisely critical what way does the existence the function restricts the case was studied reeb reeb sphere theorem states that homeomorphic sphere the case possible only small number low and homeomorphic eells kuiper manifold morse homology morse homology particularly easy way understand the homology smooth manifolds defined using generic choice morse function and riemannian metric the basic theorem that the resulting homology invariant the manifold independent the function and and isomorphic the singular homology the this implies that the morse and singular betti numbers agree and gives immediate proof the morse infinite dimensional analog morse homology known floer homology witten developed another related approach morse theory using harmonic functions morse bott theory the notion morse function can generalized consider functions that have nondegenerate manifolds critical morse bott function smooth function manifold whose critical set closed submanifold and whose hessian degenerate the normal the kernel the hessian critical point equals the tangent space the critical morse function the special case where the critical manifolds are dimensional the hessian critical points degenerate every has the index most naturally thought pair where the dimension the unstable manifold given point the critical and plus the dimension the critical the bott function perturbed small function the critical the index all critical points the perturbed function critical manifold the unperturbed function will lie between and morse bott functions are useful because generic morse functions are difficult work the functions one can and with which one can easily typically have they often lead dimensional critical raoul bott used bott theory his original proof the bott periodicity theorem round functions are examples bott where the critical sets are disjoint unions circles morse homology can also formulated for bott the differential bott homology computed spectral sequence frederic bourgeois sketched approach the course his work bott version symplectic field but
