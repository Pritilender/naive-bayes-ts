and division the division the fourth because requires multiplication the multiplication two whole numbers equivalent the addition one them with itself many times the value the other for multiplied often said times can calculated adding copies together here and are the factors and the product one the main properties multiplication that the result does not depend the place the factor that repeatedly added itself commutative property multiplied can also calculated adding copies together the multiplication integers including negative rational numbers and real numbers defined systematic generalization this basic multiplication can also visualized counting objects arranged rectangle for whole finding the area rectangle whose sides have given lengths the area rectangle does not depend which side measured which illustrates the commutative multiplying two measurements gives new depending the for the inverse operation the multiplication the for since multiplied equals then divided equals multiplication followed division yields the original number since the division number other than itself equals multiplication also defined for other types such complex numbers and more abstract like matrices for these more abstract the order that the operands are multiplied sometimes does contents notation and terminology computation historical algorithms egyptians babylonians chinese modern

notation for equals there are other mathematical notations for multiplication sometimes denoted dot signs either position dot period dot operator united states united kingdom decimal point interpunct comma citation needed addition sum subtraction product division quotient modulation remainder exponentiation base root radicand logarithm base algebra multiplication involving variables often written juxtaposition for times for five times this notation can also used for quantities that are surrounded parentheses for five times matrix multiplication there actually distinction between the cross and the dot the cross symbol generally denotes vector clarification needed while the dot denotes scalar similar convention distinguishes between the cross product and the dot product two vectors computer programming the asterisk the standard belongs most character sets and appears every this usage originated the fortran programming the numbers multiplied are generally called the factors multiplicands when thinking multiplication repeated the number multiplied called the multiplicand while the number multiples called the multiplier number that the multiplier variable expression the called coefficient the result multiplication called product and multiple each factor the other factor for the product and and both multiple and multiple computation the common methods for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper require multiplication table memorized consulted products small numbers typically any two numbers from however one the peasant multiplication algorithm does multiplying numbers more than couple decimal places hand tedious and error common logarithms were invented simplify such the slide rule allowed numbers quickly multiplied about three places beginning the early twentieth mechanical calculators such the marchant automated multiplication digit modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication historical algorithms methods multiplication were documented the egyptian greek indian and chinese civilizations the ishango bone dated about hints knowledge multiplication the upper paleolithic era central africa egyptians ancient egyptian multiplication the egyptian method multiplication integers and documented the ahmes papyrus was successive additions and for find the product and one had double three obtaining the full product could then found adding the appropriate terms found the doubling babylonians the babylonians used sexagesimal positional number system analogous the modern day decimal system thus babylonian multiplication was very similar modern decimal because the relative difficulty remembering different babylonian mathematicians employed multiplication tables these tables consisted list the first twenty multiples certain principal number followed the multiples and then compute any sexagesimal say one only needed add and computed from the chinese the mathematical text zhou suan jing dated prior and the nine chapters the mathematical art multiplication calculations were written out although the early chinese mathematicians employed rod calculus involving place value subtraction multiplication and these place value decimal arithmetic algorithms were introduced khwarizmi arab countries the early modern method the modern method multiplication based the hindu arabic numeral system was first described brahmagupta brahmagupta gave rules for subtraction multiplication and henry burchard fine then professor mathematics princeton university wrote the the indians are the inventors not only the positional decimal system but most the processes involved elementary reckoning with the addition and subtraction they performed quite they are performed multiplication they effected many ours among but division they did computer algorithms multiplication algorithm the standard method multiplying two digit numbers requires simple multiplication algorithms have been designed that reduce the computation time considerably when multiplying large particular for very large numbers methods based the discrete fourier transform can reduce the number simple multiplications the order log log log products measurements dimensional analysis when two measurements are multiplied together the product type depending the types the the general theory given dimensional analysis this analysis routinely applied physics but has also found applications one can only meaningfully add subtract quantities the same type but can multiply divide quantities different common example multiplying speed time gives products sequences capital notation the product sequence terms can written with the product which derives from the capital letter the greek alphabet unicode position contains glyph for denoting such distinct from the the meaning this notation given the subscript gives the symbol for dummy variable this called the index together with its lower bound whereas the superscript here gives its upper the lower and upper bound are expressions denoting the factors the product are obtained taking the expression following the product with successive integer values substituted for the index starting from the lower bound and incremented and including the upper for case the value the product the same that the single factor the product the empty product with the infinite products infinite product one may also consider products infinitely many these are called infinite products notationally would replace above the lemniscate the product such series defined the limit the product the first terms grows without that one can similarly replace with negative and provided both limits properties for the real and complex numbers which includes for example natural numbers integers and fractions multiplication has certain commutative property associative property order operations distributive property identity element zero element there are number further properties multiplication not satisfied all types additive inverse inverse element multiplicative inverse order reverses other mathematical systems that include multiplication operation may not have all these for multiplication commutative for matrices and quaternions axioms peano axioms the book arithmetices nova methodo exposita giuseppe peano proposed axioms for arithmetic based his axioms for natural peano arithmetic has two axioms for here represents the successor the natural number that follows the various properties like associativity can proved from these and the other axioms peano arithmetic including induction for instance denoted multiplicative identity because the axioms for integers typically define them equivalence classes ordered pairs natural the model based treating equivalent when and are treated thus both and are equivalent the multiplication axiom for integers defined this way the rule that can then deduced from multiplication extended similar way rational numbers and then real numbers multiplication with set theory though create recursive definition multiplication with set such system usually relies the peano definition multiplication cartesian product the definition multiplication repeated addition provides way arrive theoretic interpretation multiplication cardinal numbers the expression the copies are combined disjoint union then clearly they must made obvious way this use either the indexing set for the then the members are exactly those the cartesian product the properties the multiplicative operation applying natural numbers then follow trivially from the corresponding properties the cartesian multiplication group theory there are many sets under the operation satisfy the axioms that define group structure these axioms are associativity and the inclusion identity element and simple example the set zero rational numbers here have identity opposed groups under addition where the identity typically note that with the must exclude zero under does not have there rational number that can multiplied zero result this example have abelian group but that not always the see look the set invertible square matrices given over given field now straightforward verify associativity and inclusion identity the identity matrix and however matrix multiplication not therefore this group another fact note that the integers under multiplication not even exclude this easily seen the nonexistence inverse for all elements other than and multiplication group theory typically notated either juxtaposition the omission operation symbol between multiplying element element could notated when referring group via the indication the set and the dot our first example could indicated multiplication different kinds numbers numbers can count apples order the measure feet the history mathematics has progressed from counting our fingers modelling quantum multiplication has been generalized more complicated and abstract types and things that are not numbers such matrices not look much like numbers such quaternions integers rational numbers real numbers calculus products sequences complex numbers imaginary parts further generalizations multiplication group theory multiplicative group ring polynomial ring division integral domain division ring exponentiation exponentiation when multiplication the resulting operation known exponentiation for the product three factors two two raised the third and denoted two with superscript three this the number two the base and three the exponent the exponent indicates
