number navigation search number number mathematical object used count label and measure mathematics the definition number has been extended over the years include such numbers negative numbers rational numbers irrational numbers real numbers and complex numbers mathematical operations are certain procedures that take one more numbers input and produce number unary operations take single input number and produce single output for the successor operation integer thus the successor binary operations take two input numbers and produce single output examples binary operations include addition subtraction multiplication division and exponentiation the study numerical operations called arithmetic notational symbol that represents number called numeral addition their use counting and numerals are often used for labels telephone numbers for ordering serial numbers and for codes isbns common the word number can mean the abstract the the word for the number contents classification numbers natural numbers integers rational numbers real numbers complex numbers computable numbers other types specific uses numerals history first use numbers zero negative numbers rational numbers irrational numbers transcendental numbers and reals infinity and infinitesimals complex numbers prime numbers see also notes references external links classification numbers numeral system list types numbers different types numbers are used many numbers can classified into sets called number systems for different methods expressing numbers with such the roman numerals see numeral systems natural numbers natural number the most familiar numbers are the natural numbers counting and traditionally the sequence natural numbers started was not even considered number for the ancient greeks however the set theorists and other mathematicians started cardinality the empty set where thus the smallest cardinal number the set natural citation needed today different mathematicians use the term describe both including the mathematical symbol for the set all natural numbers also written and sometimes when necessary indicate whether the set should start with respectively the base numeral almost universal use today for mathematical the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits and this system the rightmost digit natural number has place value and every other digit has place value ten times that the place value the digit its set theory which capable acting axiomatic foundation for modern natural numbers can represented classes equivalent for the can represented the class all sets that have exactly three alternatively peano arithmetic the represented where the successor function the third successor many different representations are all that needed formally inscribe certain symbol pattern symbols three integers integer the negative positive integer defined number that when added the corresponding positive negative numbers are usually written with negative sign minus sign the negative and when the set negative numbers combined with the set natural numbers which the result defined the set integer also called integers also written here the letter comes from german zahl meaning number the set integers forms ring with operations addition and rational numbers rational number rational number number that can expressed fraction with integer numerator and zero integer fractions are written two the numerator and the with dividing bar between the fraction written represents equal where equal parts that size make wholes two different fractions may correspond the same rational for example and are that the absolute value greater than then the absolute value the fraction greater fractions can greater less equal and can also negative the set all rational numbers includes the since every integer can written fraction with for can the symbol for the rational numbers for quotient also written real numbers real number the real numbers include all the measuring real numbers are usually written using decimal numerals which decimal point placed the right the digit with place each digit the right the decimal point has place value tenth the place value the digit its thus represents and saying the the decimal read point thus one two three point four five the and and number other the decimal point represented period whereas continental europe and certain other countries the decimal point represented comma zero often written when must treated real number rather than the and number and always written with emphasize the negative real numbers are written with preceding minus sign every rational number also real not the however that every real number real number cannot written fraction two called irrational decimal that can written fraction either ends forever repeats because the answer problem thus the real can written and the real number forever repeating otherwise written can written the other the real number the ratio the circumference any circle its diameter since the decimal neither ends nor forever cannot written and example irrational other irrational numbers include the square root that the positive number whose square thus and are two different decimal numerals representing the natural there are infinitely many other ways representing the for and every real number either rational every real number corresponds point the number line the real numbers also have important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property the symbol for the real numbers also written when real number represents measurement there always margin error this often indicated rounding truncating that digits that suggest greater accuracy than the measurement itself are the remaining digits are called significant digits for measurements with ruler can seldom made without margin error least the sides rectangle are measured meters and then multiplication gives area for the rectangle square meters since only the first two digits after the decimal place are this usually rounded abstract algebra can shown that any complete ordered field isomorphic the real the real numbers are however algebraically closed field complex numbers complex number moving greater level the real numbers can extended the complex numbers this set numbers historically from trying find closed formulas for the roots cubic and quartic polynomials this led expressions involving the square roots negative and eventually the definition new the square root denoted symbol assigned leonhard euler and called the imaginary unit the complex numbers consist all numbers the form where and are real the expression the real number called the real part and called the imaginary part the real part complex number then the number called imaginary number referred purely imaginary the imaginary part then the number real thus the real numbers are subset the complex the real and imaginary parts complex number are both then the number called gaussian integer the symbol for the complex numbers abstract algebra the complex numbers are example algebraically closed field meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients can factored into linear like the real number the complex number system field and complete but unlike the real numbers not ordered that there meaning saying that greater nor there any meaning saying that less technical the complex numbers lack the trichotomy property complex numbers correspond points the complex plane sometimes called the argand plane for jean robert argand each the number systems mentioned above proper subset the next number symbolically computable numbers computable number moving problems the computable numbers are determined the set the real the computable also known the recursive numbers the computable are the real numbers that can computed within any desired precision terminating algorithm equivalent definitions can given using recursive functions turing machines calculus the formal representation the computable numbers form real closed field and can used the place real numbers for but not mathematical other types algebraic numbers are those that can expressed the solution polynomial equation with integer the complement the algebraic numbers are the transcendental numbers hyperreal numbers are used non standard analysis the nonstandard reals usually denoted denote ordered field that proper extension the ordered field real numbers and satisfies the transfer principle this principle allows true first order statements about reinterpreted true order statements about superreal and surreal numbers extend the real numbers adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large but still form fields the adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions the left the decimal the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions the the number system that results depends what base used for the any base but prime number base provides the best mathematical for dealing with infinite the natural numbers have been generalized the ordinal numbers and the cardinal numbers the former gives the ordering the while the latter gives its for the finite the ordinal and cardinal numbers are but they differ the infinite relation number defined the class relations consisting all those relations that are similar one member the sets numbers that are not subsets the complex numbers are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers they include the quaternions invented sir william rowan hamilton which multiplication not commutative and the octonions which multiplication not associative elements function fields zero characteristic behave some ways like numbers and are often regarded numbers number specific uses there are also other sets numbers with specialized some are subsets the complex for algebraic numbers are the roots polynomials with rational coefficients complex numbers that are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers even number integer that evenly divisible without odd number integer that not evenly divisible the fashioned term evenly now almost always shortened divisible formal definition odd number that integer the form where even number has the form where integer perfect number positive integer that the sum its proper positive divisors the sum the positive divisors not including the number equivalently perfect number number that half the sum all its positive the first perfect number because and are its proper positive divisors and the next perfect number the next perfect numbers and sequence oeis these first four perfect numbers were the only ones known early greek mathematics figurate number number that can represented regular and discrete geometric pattern dots the pattern polytopic the figurate labeled polytopic and may polygonal number polyhedral polytopic numbers for and are triangular numbers tetrahedral numbers pentatopic numbers numerals numbers should distinguished from numerals the symbols used represent boyer showed that egyptians created the first ciphered numeral citation needed greeks followed mapping their counting numbers onto ionian and doric the number five can represented both the numeral the roman numeral and ciphered notations used represent numbers are discussed the article numeral systems important development the history numerals was the development positional like modern which can represent very large the roman numerals require extra symbols for larger history first use numbers history writing ancient numbers bones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are tally marks these tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed such numbers lunar cycles keeping records such tallying system has concept place value modern decimal notation which limits its representation large nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind abstract numeral the first known system with place value was the mesopotamian system and the earliest known system dates egypt zero history zero the use number should distinguished from its use placeholder numeral place value systems many ancient texts babylonian modern and egyptian texts used egyptians used the word nfr denote balance double entry accounting entries indian texts used sanskrit word shunye shunya refer the concept void mathematics texts this word often refers the number records show that the ancient greeks seemed unsure about the status they asked themselves how can leading interesting philosophical and the medieval religious arguments about the nature and existence and the vacuum the paradoxes zeno elea depend large part the uncertain interpretation the ancient greeks even questioned was the late olmec people central mexico began use true zero shell glyph the new world possibly the century but certainly which became integral part maya numerals and the maya calendar mayan arithmetic used and written sanchez reported base finger abacus ptolemy influenced hipparchus and the was using symbol small circle with long within sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic greek numerals because was used not just this hellenistic zero was the first documented use true zero the old later byzantine manuscripts his syntaxis mathematica almagest the hellenistic zero had morphed into the greek letter omicron otherwise another true zero was used tables alongside roman numerals first known use dionysius exiguus but nulla meaning nothing not when division nihil also meaning nothing was these medieval zeros were used all future medieval computists calculators easter isolated use their was used table roman numerals bede colleague about true zero early documented use the zero brahmagupta the nta dates number and discussed operations involving including division this time the the concept had clearly reached cambodia khmer numerals and documentation shows the idea later spreading china and the islamic world negative numbers history negative numbers the abstract concept negative numbers was recognized early the chinese nine chapters the mathematical art chinese jiu zhang suanshu contains methods for finding the areas red rods were used denote positive coefficients black for this the earliest known mention negative numbers the the first reference western work was the century greece diophantus referred the equation equivalent the solution arithmetica saying that the equation gave absurd during the negative numbers were use india represent diophantus previous reference was discussed more explicitly indian mathematician brahmagupta nta who used negative numbers produce the general form quadratic formula that remains use however the century bhaskara gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value this case not for people not approve negative european mathematicians for the most resisted the concept negative numbers until the although fibonacci allowed negative solutions financial problems where they could interpreted debts liber abaci and later losses flos the same the chinese were indicating negative numbers either drawing diagonal stroke through the most zero digit the corresponding positive the first use negative numbers european work was chuquet during the used them exponents but referred them absurd recently the was common practice ignore any negative results returned equations the assumption that they were just ren descartes did with negative solutions cartesian coordinate system rational numbers likely that the concept fractional numbers dates prehistoric times the ancient egyptians used their egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers mathematical texts such the rhind mathematical papyrus and the kahun papyrus classical greek and indian mathematicians made studies the theory rational part the general study number theory the best known these euclid elements dating roughly the indian the most relevant the sthananga sutra which also covers number theory part general study the concept decimal fractions closely linked with decimal value the two seem have developed for common for the jain math sutras include calculations fraction approximations the square root similarly babylonian math texts had always used sexagesimal fractions with great irrational numbers history irrational numbers the earliest known use irrational numbers was the indian sulba sutras composed between and the first existence proofs irrational numbers usually attributed pythagoras more specifically the pythagorean hippasus metapontum who produced most likely proof the irrationality the square root the story goes that hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying represent the square root however pythagoras believed the absoluteness and could not accept the existence irrational could not disprove their existence through but could not accept irrational sentenced hippasus death the century brought final european acceptance negative integral and fractional numbers the mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern was however until the century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental and once more undertook scientific study had remained almost dormant since euclid the publication the theories karl weierstrass his pupil kossak heine crelle georg cantor and richard dedekind was brought ray had taken the same point departure but the theory generally referred the year weierstrass method was completely set forth salvatore pincherle and has received additional prominence through the later work and endorsement paul tannery weierstrass cantor and heine base their theories infinite while dedekind founds his the idea cut the system real numbers separating all rational numbers into two groups having certain characteristic the subject has received later contributions the hands kronecker and continued fractions closely related irrational numbers and due received attention the hands euler and the opening the century were brought into prominence through the writings joseph louis lagrange other noteworthy contributions have been made druckenm ller kunze lemke and nther ramus first connected the subject with determinants resulting with the subsequent contributions bius and the theory dirichlet also added the general have numerous contributors the applications the transcendental numbers and reals history the first results concerning transcendental numbers were lambert proof that cannot and also that irrational rational unless the constant was first referred napier work logarithms legendre extended this proof show that not the square root rational the search for roots quintic and higher degree equations was important the abel ruffini theorem ruffini abel showed that they could not solved radicals formulas involving only arithmetical operations and hence was necessary consider the wider set algebraic numbers all solutions polynomial galois linked polynomial equations group theory giving rise the field galois theory the existence transcendental numbers was first established liouville hermite proved that transcendental and lindemann proved that finally cantor shows that the set all real numbers uncountably infinite but the set all algebraic numbers countably infinite there uncountably infinite number transcendental infinity and infinitesimals history infinity the earliest known conception mathematical infinity appears the yajur veda ancient indian which one point you remove part from infinity add part still what remains infinity was popular topic philosophical study among the jain mathematicians they distinguished between five types infinite one and two infinite infinite and infinite aristotle defined the traditional western notion mathematical distinguished between actual infinity and potential infinity the general consensus being that only the latter had true galileo galilei two new sciences discussed the idea one one correspondences between infinite but the next major advance the theory was made georg cantor published book about his new set theory introducing among other transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis this was the first mathematical model that represented infinity numbers and gave rules for operating with these infinite the abraham robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can rigorously defined and used develop the field nonstandard the system hyperreal numbers represents rigorous method treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually scientists and engineers ever since the invention infinitesimal calculus newton and leibniz modern geometrical version infinity given projective geometry which introduces ideal points one for each spatial each family parallel lines given direction postulated converge the corresponding ideal this closely related the idea vanishing points perspective drawing complex numbers history complex numbers the earliest fleeting reference square roots negative numbers occurred the work the mathematician and inventor heron alexandria the century when considered the volume impossible frustum pyramid they became more prominent when the century closed formulas for the roots third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered italian mathematicians such niccol fontana tartaglia and gerolamo cardano was soon realized that these even one was only interested real sometimes required the manipulation square roots negative this was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers firm ground the when ren descartes coined the term imaginary for these quantities intended see imaginary number for discussion the reality complex further source confusion was that the equation seemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity which valid for positive real numbers and and was also used complex number calculations with one positive and the other the incorrect use this and the related identity the case when both and are negative even bedeviled euler this difficulty eventually led him the convention using the special symbol place guard against this the century saw the work abraham moivre and leonhard euler formula states and euler euler formula complex analysis the existence complex numbers was not completely accepted until caspar wessel described the geometrical interpretation carl friedrich gauss rediscovered and popularized several years and result the theory complex numbers received notable the idea the graphic representation complex numbers had however early wallis algebra tractatus also gauss provided the first generally accepted proof the fundamental theorem algebra showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has full set solutions that the general acceptance the theory complex numbers due the labors augustin louis cauchy and niels henrik abel and especially the who was the first boldly use complex numbers with success that gauss studied complex numbers the form where and are rational and one the two roots his gotthold eisenstein studied the type where complex root other such classes called cyclotomic fields complex numbers derive from the roots unity for higher values this generalization largely due ernst kummer who also invented ideal numbers which were expressed geometrical entities felix klein the general theory fields was created variste galois who studied the fields generated the roots any polynomial equation victor alexandre puiseux took the key step distinguishing between poles and branch and introduced the concept essential singular points this eventually led the concept the extended complex plane prime numbers prime numbers have been studied throughout recorded euclid devoted one book the elements the theory proved the infinitude the primes and the fundamental theorem arithmetic and presented the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor two eratosthenes used the sieve eratosthenes quickly isolate prime but most further development the theory primes europe dates the renaissance and later adrien marie legendre conjectured the prime number theorem describing the asymptotic distribution other results concerning the distribution the primes include proof that the sum the reciprocals the primes and the goldbach conjecture which claims that any sufficiently large even number the sum two yet another conjecture related the distribution prime numbers the riemann hypothesis formulated bernhard riemann the prime number theorem was finally proved jacques hadamard and charles poussin goldbach and conjectures remain unproven and see also numbers arabic numerals
