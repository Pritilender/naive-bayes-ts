the school sense algebra was exceptionally well late neoplatonic sources state that pythagoras learned mathematics from the much earlier sources state that thales and pythagoras traveled and studied egypt euclid very probably very simple material odd times even odd number measures divides even then also measures divides half but all that needed prove that irrational pythagorean mystics gave great importance the odd and the the discovery that irrational credited the early pythagoreans theodorus revealing modern that numbers could this discovery seems have provoked the first foundational crisis mathematical its proof its divulgation are sometimes credited hippasus who was expelled split from the pythagorean only here that can start speak conscious division between numbers integers and the the subjects and lengths real whether rational the pythagorean tradition spoke also called polygonal figurate numbers while square cubic etc are seen now more natural than triangular square pentagonal etc the study the sums triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful the early modern period early know clearly arithmetical material ancient egyptian vedic sources though there some algebra the chinese remainder theorem appears exercise sun suan ching also known the mathematical classic sun century there one important step glossed over sun note the problem that was later solved aka see below there also some numerical mysticism chinese note but unlike that the seems have led like the perfect magic squares have passed from superstition into classical greece and the early hellenistic period aside from few the mathematics classical greece known either through the reports contemporary mathematicians through mathematical works from the early hellenistic the case number this and plato and euclid respectively plato had keen interest and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and arithmetic theorising rather than what arithmetic number theory have come through one theaetetus that know that theodorus had proven that are theaetetus was like disciple worked distinguishing different kinds and was thus arguably pioneer the study number systems book euclid elements described pappus being largely based euclid devoted part his elements prime numbers and topics that belong unambiguously number theory and are basic books vii euclid elements gave algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor two numbers the euclidean algorithm elements prop vii and the first known proof the infinitude primes elements prop lessing published epigram had found manuscript during his work claimed letter sent archimedes eratosthenes the epigram proposed what has become known archimedes cattle problem its solution absent from the requires solving indeterminate quadratic equation which reduces what would later misnamed pell equation far such equations were first successfully treated the indian school not known whether archimedes himself had method diophantus arithmetica latin claude gaspard bachet ziriac very little known about diophantus alexandria probably lived the third century that about five hundred years after six out the thirteen books arithmetica survive the original four more books survive arabic the arithmetica collection out problems where the task invariably find rational solutions system polynomial usually the form thus nowadays speak diophantine equations when speak polynomial equations which rational integer solutions must one may say that diophantus was studying rational points points whose coordinates are rational curves and algebraic varieties however unlike the greeks the classical who did what would now call basic algebra geometrical diophantus did what would now call basic algebraic geometry purely algebraic modern what diophantus did was find rational parametrizations that given equation the form his aim was find three rational functions such for all values and setting for gives solution diophantus also studied the equations some rational for which rational parametrisation managed find some rational points these curves elliptic curves what seems their first known means what amounts tangent translated into coordinate geometry which did not exist his method would visualised drawing tangent curve known rational and then finding the other point intersection the tangent with the that other point new rational diophantus also resorted what could called special case secant while diophantus was concerned largely with rational assumed some results integer particular that every integer the sum four squares though never stated much indian brahmagupta skara while greek thanks alexander probably influenced indian the point introducing seems the case that indian mathematics otherwise indigenous there evidence that elements reached india before the showed that pairs simultaneous congruences could solved method called aka pulveriser this procedure close generalisation the euclidean algorithm which was probably discovered independently seems have had mind applications astronomical brahmagupta started the systematic study indefinite quadratic the misnamed pell equation which archimedes may have first been and which did not start solved the west until the time fermat and later sanskrit authors would using technical general procedure the chakravala cyclic for solving equation was finally found jayadeva cited the eleventh his work otherwise the earliest surviving exposition appears skara ita twelfth unfortunately indian mathematics remained largely unknown the west until the late eighteenth brahmagupta and work was translated into english henry colebrooke arithmetic the islamic golden age haytham selenographia sic the early ninth the caliph mun ordered translations many greek mathematical works and least one sanskrit work the sindhind which may may not brahmagupta nta thus giving rise the tradition islamic mathematics diophantus main the arithmetica was translated into arabic qusta ibn luqa part the treatise fakhri builds some according rashed contemporary ibn haytham knew what would later called wilson theorem western europe the middle ages other than treatise squares arithmetic progression fibonacci who lived and studied north africa and constantinople during his formative number theory speak was done western europe during the middle matters started change europe the late renaissance thanks renewed study the works greek catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into latin arithmetica bachet following first attempt xylander early modern number theory fermat pierre fermat never published his his work number theory contained almost entirely letters mathematicians and private marginal wrote down nearly proofs number had models the did make repeated use mathematical induction introducing the method infinite descent one first interests was perfect numbers which appear elements and amicable numbers note this led him work integer divisors which were from the beginning among the subjects the correspondence onwards that put him touch with the mathematical community the had already studied bachet edition diophantus his interests had shifted largely diophantine problems and sums squares also treated fermat achievements arithmetic fermat little theorem stating not divisible prime then note and are then not divisible any prime congruent modulo and every prime congruent modulo can written the form these two statements also date from fermat stated huygens that had proven the latter statement the method infinite descent fermat and frenicle also did some work some erroneous other quadratic fermat posed the problem solving challenge english mathematicians the problem was solved few months wallis and fermat considered their solution but pointed out they had provided algorithm without proof had jayadeva and though fermat would never know states that proof can found fermat developed methods for doing what our terms amounts finding points curves genus and there are many special procedures and what amounts tangent but use secant fermat states and proves the appendix observations diophantus xlv that has trivial solutions the fermat also mentioned his correspondents that has trivial and that this could proven the first known proof due euler indeed fermat claim fermat last theorem have shown there are solutions for all fact the only known proofs which were completely beyond his appears only his annotations the margin his copy never claimed this others and thus would have had need retract found any mistake his supposed euler the interest leonhard euler number theory was first spurred when friend the amateur note goldbach pointed him towards some work the this has been called the rebirth modern number after relative lack success getting his attention for the euler work number theory includes the proofs for this includes fermat little theorem generalised euler prime the fact that and only initial work towards proof that every integer the sum four squares the first complete proof joseph louis lagrange soon improved euler himself the lack zero integer solutions implying the case last the case which euler also proved related pell equation first misnamed wrote the link between continued fractions and first steps towards analytic number theory his work sums four partitions pentagonal numbers and the distribution prime euler pioneered the use what can seen analysis infinite number since lived before the development complex analysis most his work restricted the formal manipulation power series however some very notable though not fully early work what would later called the riemann zeta function quadratic forms following euler did further research the question which primes can expressed the form some prefiguring quadratic reciprocity diophantine equations euler worked some diophantine equations genus and studied diophantus tried systematise but the time was not yet ripe for such endeavour algebraic geometry was still its did notice there was connection between diophantine problems and elliptic integrals whose study had himself lagrange legendre and gauss carl friedrich gauss disquisitiones arithmeticae louis lagrange was the first give full proofs some and work and observations for the four square theorem and the basic theory the misnamed for which algorithmic solution was found fermat and his and also jayadeva and bhaskara before also studied quadratic forms full generality opposed defining their equivalence showing how put them reduced etc adrien marie legendre was the first state the law quadratic also conjectured what amounts the prime number theorem and dirichlet theorem arithmetic progressions gave full treatment the equation and worked quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully his old was the first prove last for completing work peter gustav lejeune dirichlet and crediting both him and sophie germain his disquisitiones arithmeticae carl friedrich gauss proved the law quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory quadratic forms defining their also introduced some basic notation congruences and devoted section computational including primality the last section the disquisitiones established link between roots unity and number the theory the division the which treated does not belong itself but its principles can only drawn from higher this gauss arguably made first foray towards both variste galois work and algebraic number theory maturity and division into subfields ernst kummer peter gustav lejeune dirichlet starting early the nineteenth the following developments gradually took the rise consciousness number theory higher arithmetic field the development much modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number complex analysis group theory galois theory accompanied greater rigor analysis and abstraction the rough subdivision number theory into its modern analytic and algebraic number theory algebraic number theory may said start with the study reciprocity and cyclotomy but truly came into its own with the development abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory see conventional starting point for analytic number theory dirichlet theorem arithmetic progressions whose proof introduced functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and limiting process real the first use analytic ideas number theory actually goes back euler who used formal power series and rigorous limiting the use complex analysis number theory comes the work bernhard riemann the zeta function the canonical starting jacobi square theorem which predates belongs initially different strand that has now taken leading role analytic number theory modular forms the history each subfield briefly addressed its own section see the main article each subfield for fuller many the most interesting questions each area remain open and are being actively worked main subdivisions elementary tools the term elementary generally denotes method that does not use complex analysis for the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis but elementary proof was found only erd and selberg the term somewhat for proofs based complex tauberian theorems wiener ikehara are often seen quite enlightening but not spite using fourier rather than complex analysis here elementary proof may longer and more difficult for most readers than elementary number theory has the reputation being field many whose results can stated the the same the proofs these results are not particularly part because the range tools they use unusually broad within analytic number theory analytic number theory riemann zeta function complex plane argument modular group upper half plane fundamental domain analytic number theory may defined terms its the study the integers means tools from real and complex terms its the study within number theory estimates size and opposed some subjects generally considered part analytic number sieve theory note are better covered the second rather than the first some sieve for uses little note yet considered part analytic number the following are examples problems analytic number the prime number theorem the goldbach conjecture the twin prime conjecture the hardy littlewood conjectures the waring problem and the riemann hypothesis some the most important tools analytic number theory are the circle method sieve methods and functions rather the study their the theory modular forms more automorphic forms also occupies increasingly central place the toolbox analytic number one may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers and use analytic means answer such thus that algebraic and analytic number theory for one may define prime ideals generalizations prime numbers living the field algebraic and ask how many prime ideals there are certain this question can answered means examination dedekind zeta functions which are generalizations the riemann zeta function important analytic object that describes the distribution prime algebraic number theory algebraic number theory algebraic number theory studies algebraic properties and algebraic objects interest number analytic and algebraic number theory can and the former defined its the latter its objects key topic that the algebraic numbers which are generalizations the rational briefly algebraic number any complex number that solution some polynomial equation with rational for every solution algebraic fields algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields shortly number fields could argued that the simplest kind number fields quadratic were already studied the discussion quadratic forms disquisitiones arithmeticae can restated terms ideals and norms quadratic quadratic field consists all numbers the form where and are rational numbers and fixed rational number whose square root not for that the century chakravala method amounts modern algorithm for finding the units real quadratic number however neither skara nor gauss knew number fields the grounds the subject know were set the late nineteenth when ideal numbers the theory ideals and valuation theory were these are three complementary ways dealing with the lack unique factorisation algebraic number for the field generated the rationals and the number can factorised both and all and are and analogous primes among the the initial impetus for the development ideal numbers kummer seems have come from the study higher reciprocity generalisations quadratic reciprocity number fields are often studied extensions smaller number field said extension field contains for the complex numbers are extension the reals and the reals are extension the rationals classifying the possible extensions given number field difficult and partially open abelian that extensions such that the galois group note gal over abelian group are relatively well their classification was the object the programme class field theory which was initiated the late century partly kronecker and eisenstein and carried out largely example active area research algebraic number theory iwasawa theory the langlands program one the main current scale research plans sometimes described attempt generalise class field theory abelian extensions number diophantine geometry diophantine geometry glossary arithmetic and diophantine geometry the central problem diophantine geometry determine when diophantine equation has and how the approach taken think the solutions equation geometric for equation two variables defines curve the more system two more variables defines curve surface some other such object dimensional diophantine one asks whether there are any rational points points all whose coordinates are integral points points all whose coordinates are the curve there are any such the next step ask how many there are and how they are basic question this direction are there finitely infinitely many rational points given curve what about integer example here may consider the pythagorean equation would like study its rational its solutions such that and are both this the same asking for all integer solutions any solution the latter equation gives solution the also the same asking for all points with rational coordinates the curve described this curve happens circle radius around the elliptic curve torus the rephrasing questions equations terms points curves turns out the finiteness not the number rational integer points algebraic that rational integer solutions equation where polynomial two turns out depend crucially the genus the the genus can defined note allow the variables complex then defines dimensional surface dimensional space since two complex variables can decomposed into four real four count the number holes the call this number the genus other geometrical notions turn out just there also the closely linked area diophantine approximations given number how well can approximated are looking for approximations that are good relative the amount space that takes write the call with good approximation where this question special interest algebraic cannot well then some equations not have integer rational moreover several concepts especially that height turn out crucial both diophantine geometry and the study diophantine this question also special interest transcendence theory number can better approximated than any algebraic then transcendental number this argument that and have been shown diophantine geometry should not confused with the geometry numbers which collection graphical methods for answering certain questions algebraic number arithmetic geometry the other contemporary term for much the same domain that covered the term diophantine geometry the term arithmetic geometry arguably used most often when one wishes emphasise the connections modern algebraic geometry for faltings theorem rather than techniques diophantine recent approaches and subfields the areas below date such from earlier than the twentieth even they are based older for explained the matter algorithms number theory very some sense older than the concept the same the modern study computability dates only from the and and computational complexity theory from the probabilistic number theory probabilistic number theory take number random between one and how likely this just another way asking how many primes there are between one and further how many prime divisors will how many divisors will have and with what what the probability that have many more many fewer divisors prime divisors than the much probabilistic number theory can seen important special case the study variables that are but not mutually independent for the event that random integer between one and million divisible two and the event that divisible three are almost but not sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than must happen one may say with equal justice that many applications probabilistic number theory hinge the fact that whatever unusual must certain algebraic objects rational integer solutions certain can shown the tail certain sensibly defined follows that there must few this very concrete probabilistic statement following from probabilistic probabilistic approach leads number heuristic algorithms and open notably cram conjecture arithmetic combinatorics arithmetic combinatorics additive number theory let set integers consider the set consisting all sums two elements much larger than barely barely larger than must have plenty arithmetic for does resemble arithmetic progression begin from fairly thick infinite set does contain many elements arithmetic say should possible write large integers

algorithms for testing primality but spite much work both theoretical and truly fast algorithm for the difficulty computation can modern protocols for encrypting messages rsa depend functions that are known but whose inverses are known only chosen and would take one too long time figure out for these functions can such that their inverses can computed only certain large integers are while many difficult computational problems outside number theory are most working encryption protocols nowadays are based the difficulty few theoretical different note some things may not computable this can proven some for was proven that there turing machine which can solve all diophantine equations see hilbert problem there are thus some problems number theory that will never even know the shape some viz diophantine equations nine simply not and cannot which coefficients give equations for which the following two statements are both there are and shall never know that there are applications the
