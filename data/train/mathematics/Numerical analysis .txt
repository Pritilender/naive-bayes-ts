introducing more precise november square root sexagesimal decimal numerical analysis the study algorithms that use numerical approximation opposed general symbolic manipulations for the problems mathematical analysis distinguished from discrete mathematics one the earliest mathematical writings babylonian tablet from the yale babylonian collection ybc which gives sexagesimal numerical approximation the length the diagonal unit square being able compute the sides triangle and being able compute square extremely for astronomy carpentry and numerical analysis continues this long tradition practical mathematical much like the babylonian approximation modern numerical analysis does not seek exact because exact answers are often impossible obtain instead much numerical analysis concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds numerical analysis naturally finds applications all fields engineering and the physical but the century also the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements scientific ordinary differential equations appear celestial mechanics stars and numerical linear algebra important for data stochastic differential equations and markov chains are essential simulating living cells for medicine and before the advent modern computers numerical methods often depended hand interpolation large printed since the mid

than other market airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms decide ticket airplane and crew assignments and fuel historically such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field operations research insurance companies use numerical programs for actuarial analysis the rest this section outlines several important themes numerical history the field numerical analysis predates the invention modern computers many linear interpolation was already use more than years many great mathematicians the past were preoccupied numerical obvious from the names important algorithms like newton method lagrange interpolation polynomial gaussian elimination euler method facilitate computations large books were produced with formulas and tables data such interpolation points and function using these often calculated out decimal places more for some one could look values plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates some the canonical work the field the nist publication edited abramowitz and stegun plus page book very large number commonly used formulas and functions and their values many the function values are longer very useful when computer but the large listing formulas can still very the mechanical calculator was also developed tool for hand these calculators evolved into electronic computers the and was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative but the invention the computer also influenced the field numerical since now longer and more complicated calculations could direct and iterative methods direct iterative methods consider the problem solving for the unknown quantity subtract divide take cube roots for the iterative apply the bisection method the initial values are conclude from this table that the solution between and the algorithm might return any number that range with error less than discretization and numerical integration two hour have measured the speed the car three instants and recorded them the following discretization would say that the speed the car was constant from then from and finally from for the total distance traveled the first minutes approximately this would allow estimate the total distance traveled which example numerical integration see using riemann sum because displacement the integral ill posed problem take the function note that and change less than turns into change nearly evaluating near conditioned well posed problem the function continuous and evaluating least for being not close direct methods compute the solution problem finite number these methods would give the precise answer they were performed infinite precision arithmetic examples include gaussian elimination the factorization method for solving systems linear equations and the simplex method linear programming finite precision used and the result approximation the true solution assuming stability contrast direct iterative methods are not expected terminate finite number starting from initial iterative methods form successive approximations that converge the exact solution only the convergence often involving the residual specified order decide when sufficiently accurate solution has been even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within finite number steps examples include newton method the bisection method and jacobi iteration computational matrix iterative methods are generally needed for large iterative methods are more common than direct methods numerical some methods are direct principle but are usually used though they were gmres and the conjugate gradient method for these methods the number steps needed obtain the exact solution large that approximation accepted the same manner for iterative discretization furthermore continuous problems must sometimes replaced discrete problem whose solution known approximate that the continuous this process called discretization for the solution differential equation function this function must represented finite amount for instance its value finite number points its even though this domain continuum generation and propagation errors the study errors forms important part numerical there are several ways which error can introduced the solution the round off round off errors arise because impossible represent all real numbers exactly machine with finite memory which what all practical digital computers are truncation and discretization error truncation errors are committed when iterative method terminated mathematical procedure and the approximate solution differs from the exact similarly discretization induces discretization error because the solution the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution the continuous for the iteration the sidebar compute the solution after conclude that the root roughly for therefore have truncation error once error will generally propagate through the for have already noted that the operation calculator follows that calculation the type even more what does mean when say that the truncation error created when approximate mathematical know that integrate function exactly requires one find the sum infinite but numerically one can find the sum only finite and hence the approximation the mathematical similarly differentiate the differential element approaches zero but numerically can only choose finite value the differential numerical stability and posed problems numerical stability important notion numerical algorithm called numerically stable whatever its does not grow much larger during the this happens the problem well conditioned meaning that the solution changes only small amount the problem data are changed small the problem ill conditioned then any small error the data will grow large both the original problem and the algorithm used solve that problem can well conditioned and ill conditioned and any combination algorithm that solves conditioned problem may either numerically stable numerically art numerical analysis find stable algorithm for solving posed mathematical for computing the square root which roughly posed many algorithms solve this problem starting with initial approximation for instance and then computing improved guesses etc one such method the famous babylonian method which given another which will call method given have calculated few iterations each scheme table form with initial guesses and observe that the babylonian method converges fast regardless the initial whereas method converges extremely slowly with initial guess and diverges for initial guess hence the babylonian method numerically while method numerically numerical stability loss significance subtractive cancelation the example taken from numerical methods using areas study the field numerical analysis includes many some the major ones computing values functions interpolation have observed the temperature vary from degrees celsius degrees linear interpolation this data would conclude that was degrees and degrees extrapolation the gross domestic product country has been growing average per year and was billion dollars last might extrapolate that will billion dollars this regression linear given points compute line that passes close possible those points optimization say you sell lemonade lemonade stand and notice that you can sell glasses lemonade per and that for each increase you will sell one glass lemonade less per you could charge you would maximize your but due the constraint having charge whole cent charging per glass will yield the maximum income per differential equation you set fans blow air from one end the room the other and then you drop feather into the what the feather will follow the air which may very one approximation measure the speed which the air blowing near the feather every and advance the simulated feather were moving straight line that same speed for one before measuring the wind speed this called the euler method for solving ordinary differential one the simplest problems the evaluation function given the most straightforward just plugging the number the formula sometimes not very for better approach using the horner scheme since reduces the necessary number multiplications and generally important estimate and control round off errors arising from the use floating point arithmetic interpolation extrapolation and regression interpolation solves the following given the value some unknown function number what value does that function have some other point between the given extrapolation very similar except that now want find the value the unknown function point which outside the given regression also but takes into account that the data given some and measurement the value some function these points with want determine the unknown the least squares method one popular way achieve solving equations and systems equations another fundamental problem computing the solution some given two cases are commonly depending whether the equation linear for the equation linear while much effort has been put the development methods for solving systems linear equations standard direct methods that use some matrix decomposition are gaussian elimination decomposition cholesky decomposition for symmetric hermitian and positive definite matrix and decomposition for square iterative methods such the jacobi method gauss seidel method successive relaxation and conjugate gradient method are usually preferred for large general iterative methods can developed using matrix splitting root finding algorithms are used solve nonlinear equations they are named since root function argument for which the function yields the function differentiable and the derivative then newton method popular linearization another technique for solving nonlinear solving eigenvalue singular value problems several important problems can phrased terms eigenvalue decompositions singular value decompositions for the spectral image compression algorithm based the singular value the corresponding tool statistics called principal component analysis optimization mathematical optimization optimization problems ask for the point which given function maximized often the point also has satisfy some constraints the field optimization further split several depending the form the objective function and the for linear programming deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are famous method linear programming the simplex method the method lagrange multipliers can used reduce optimization problems with constraints unconstrained optimization evaluating integrals numerical integration numerical some instances also known numerical quadrature asks for the value definite integral popular methods use one the newton cotes formulas like the midpoint rule simpson rule gaussian quadrature these methods rely divide and strategy whereby integral relatively large set broken down into integrals smaller higher where these methods become prohibitively expensive terms computational one may use monte carlo quasi monte carlo methods see monte carlo integration modestly large the method sparse grids differential equations numerical ordinary differential equations numerical partial differential equations numerical analysis also concerned with computing approximate the solution differential equations both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations partial differential equations are solved first discretizing the bringing into dimensional this can done finite element method finite difference method particularly finite volume method the theoretical justification these methods often involves theorems from functional analysis this reduces the problem the solution algebraic software list numerical analysis software comparison numerical analysis software since the late twentieth most
