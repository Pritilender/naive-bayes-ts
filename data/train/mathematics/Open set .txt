topology open set abstract concept generalizing the idea open interval the real the simplest example metric spaces where open sets can defined those sets which contain open ball around each their points equivalently set open contain any its boundary points however open can very any collection sets can called long the union arbitrary number open sets the intersection finite number open sets and the space itself these conditions are very and they allow enormous flexibility the choice open the two every set can open called the discrete topology set can open but the space itself the indiscrete topology however open sets are usually chosen similar the open intervals the real the notion open set provides fundamental way speak nearness points topological space without explicitly having concept distance once choice open sets the properties continuity connectedness and compactness which use notions can defined using these open each choice open sets for space called topology although open sets and the topologies that they comprise are central importance point set topology they are also used organizational tool other important branches examples topologies include the zariski topology algebraic geometry that reflects the algebraic nature varieties and the topology differential manifold differential topology where each point within the space contained open set that homeomorphic open ball dimensional euclidean space contents motivation definitions euclidean space metric spaces topological spaces properties uses notes and cautions open defined relative particular topology open and closed are not mutually exclusive see also references external links motivation intuitively open set provides method distinguish two for about one point topological space there exists open set not containing another point the two points are referred topologically distinguishable this one may speak whether two subsets topological space are near without concretely defining metric the topological therefore topological spaces may seen generalization metric the set all real numbers one has the natural euclidean that function which measures the distance between two real therefore given real one can speak the set all points close that real that within that real number refer this real number points within approximate accuracy degree note that always but becomes smaller and one obtains points that approximate higher and higher degree for and the points within are precisely the points the interval that the set all real numbers between and however with the points within are precisely the points clearly these points approximate greater degree accuracy compared when the previous discussion for the case that one may approximate higher and higher degrees accuracy defining smaller and sets the form give lot information about points close thus rather than speaking concrete euclidean one may use sets describe points close this innovative idea has reaching defining different collections sets containing distinct from the sets one may find different results regarding the distance between and other real for were define the only such set for measuring all points are close since there only one possible degree accuracy one may achieve approximating being member thus find that some every real number distance away from may help this case think the measure being binary all things are equally close while any item that not not close one refers the family sets containing used approximate neighborhood basis member this neighborhood basis referred open set one may generalize these notions arbitrary set rather than just the real this given point that one may define collection sets around that containing used approximate this collection would have satisfy certain properties known axioms for otherwise may not have defined method measure for every point should approximate some degree thus should this once begin define smaller sets containing tend approximate greater degree bearing this one may define the remaining axioms that the family sets about required definitions the concept open sets can formalized with various degrees for euclidean space subset the euclidean space called open given any point there exists real number such given any point whose euclidean distance from smaller than also belongs equivalently subset open every point has neighborhood contained metric spaces subset metric space called open given any point there exists real number such given any point with also belongs equivalently open every point has neighbourhood contained this generalises the euclidean space since euclidean space with the euclidean distance metric topological spaces let set and family sets with the following and are any union sets any finite intersection sets call the sets the open given definition neighbourhood one can define open set topological space then subset called open and only neighbourhood each its note that infinite intersections open sets need not for the intersection all intervals the form where positive the set which not open the real sets that can constructed the intersection countably many open sets are denoted sets the topological definition open sets generalises the metric space one begins with metric space and defines open sets then the family all open sets topology the metric every metric space natural topological there however topological spaces that are not metric properties the empty set both open and closed clopen set the set that the topology defined both open and closed clopen set the union any number open sets the intersection finite number open sets uses open sets have fundamental importance topology the concept required define and make sense topological space and other topological structures that deal with the notions closeness and convergence for spaces such metric spaces and uniform spaces every subset topological space contains possibly open the largest such open set called the interior can constructed taking the union all the open sets contained given topological spaces and function from continuous the preimage every open set open the function called open the image every open set open open set the real line has the characteristic property that countable union disjoint open notes and cautions open defined relative particular topology whether set open depends the topology under having opted for greater brevity over greater clarity refer set endowed with topology the topological space rather than the topological space despite the fact that all the topological data contained there are two topologies the same set that open the first topology might fail open the second for any topological space and any subset the set can given its own topology called the subspace defined set open the subspace topology and only the intersection with open set from the original topology this potentially introduces new open open the original topology but isn then open the subspace topology but not the original topology concrete example defined the set rational numbers the interval then open subset the rational numbers but not the real numbers this because when the surrounding space the rational for every point there exists positive number such that all rational points within distance are also the other when the surrounding space the then for every point there positive such that all real points within distance are since contains rational open and closed are not mutually exclusive set might closed both for use the real line with its usual topology the euclidean topology which defined every interval real numbers belongs the and every union such belongs the any topology the entire set declared open the empty moreover the complement the entire set the empty since has open this means definition that hence any the entire space simultaneously open and closed clopen the interval open because belongs the euclidean were have open would mean definition that were but does not have open its complement which does not belong the euclidean topology since not union intervals the form hence example set that open but not similar the interval closed but not finally since neither nor its complement belongs the euclidean topology neither one can written union intervals the form this means that neither open nor see also closed set clopen set neighbourhood
