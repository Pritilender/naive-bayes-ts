mathematics	operation navigation search elementary arithmetic the general operation explained this page should not confused with the more specific operators vector spaces for notion elementary see arithmetic operation its simplest meaning mathematics and logic operation action procedure which produces new value from one more input called operands there are two common types unary and binary unary operations involve only one such negation and trigonometric functions binary the other take two and include addition subtraction multiplication division and exponentiation operations can involve mathematical objects other than the logical values true and false can combined using logic operations such and and not vectors can added and rotations can combined using the function composition operation performing the first rotation and then the operations sets include the binary operations union and intersection and the unary operation complementation operations functions include composition and convolution operations may not defined for every possible for the real numbers one cannot divide zero take square roots negative the values for which operation defined form set called its domain the set which contains the values produced called the codomain but the set actual values attained the operation its range for the real the squaring operation only produces nonnegative the codomain the set real numbers but the range the nonnegative operations can involve dissimilar vector can multiplied scalar form another and the inner product operation two vectors produces operation may may not have certain for example may associative commutative anticommutative idempotent and the values combined are called operands arguments inputs and the value produced called the value result output operations can have fewer more than two operation like operator but the point view for one often speaks the operation addition when focusing the operands and but one says addition rarely operator when focusing the from the more abstract the function contents general description see also special cases related topics notes general description operation function the form where the sets are called the domains the the set called the codomain the and the fixed negative integer the number called the type arity the thus unary operation has arity and binary operation has arity operation arity called nullary operation simply element the codomain operation arity called ary thus ary operation ary relation that functional its first domains the above describes what usually called finitary operation referring the finite number arguments the value there are obvious extensions where the arity taken infinite ordinal cardinal even arbitrary set indexing the often use the term operation implies that the domain the function power the codomain the cartesian product one more copies the although this means the example multiplying vector see also algebra unicode mathematical operators special cases unary operation binary operation related topics arity binary relation domain function hyperoperation multigrade operator operator order operations parametric operator relation triadic relation arithmetic
