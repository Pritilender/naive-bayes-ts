framework for describing statements such this less than this precedes this article introduces the field and provides basic list theoretic terms can found the order theory glossary contents background and motivation basic definitions partially ordered sets visualizing poset special elements within order duality constructing new orders functions between orders special types orders subsets ordered sets related mathematical areas universal algebra topology category theory history see also notes references external links background and motivation orders are everywhere mathematics and related fields like computer science the first order often discussed primary school the standard order the natural numbers less than greater than does tom have fewer cookies than this intuitive concept can extended orders other sets numbers such the integers and the reals the idea being greater than less than another number one the basic intuitions number systems compare with numeral systems general although one usually also interested the actual difference two which not given the another familiar example ordering the lexicographic order words the above types orders have special each element can compared any other smaller however this not always desired for consider the subset ordering sets set contains all the elements set then said smaller than equal yet there are some sets that cannot related this whenever both contain some elements that are not the the two sets are not related hence subset inclusion only partial order opposed the total orders given order theory captures the intuition orders that arises from such examples general this achieved specifying properties that relation must have mathematical this more abstract approach makes much because one can derive numerous theorems the general without focusing the details any particular these insights can then readily transferred many less abstract driven the wide practical usage numerous special kinds ordered sets have been some which have grown into mathematical fields their order theory does not restrict itself the various classes ordering but also considers appropriate functions between simple example order theoretic property for functions comes from analysis where monotone functions are frequently basic definitions this section introduces ordered sets building upon the concepts set theory arithmetic and binary relations partially ordered sets orders are special binary suppose that set and that relation then partial order reflexive antisymmetric and transitive for all and have set with partial order called partially ordered set poset just ordered set the intended meaning checking these one immediately sees that the known orders natural numbers integers rational numbers and reals are all orders the above however they have the additional property being total for all and have these orders can also called linear orders chains while many classical orders are the subset order sets provides example where this not the another example given the divisibility relation for two natural numbers and write divides without one easily sees that this yields partial the identity relation any set also partial order which every two distinct elements are also the only relation that both partial order and equivalence relation many advanced properties posets are interesting mainly for linear visualizing poset hasse diagram hasse diagrams can visually represent the elements and relations partial these are graph drawings where the vertices are the elements the poset and the ordering relation indicated both the edges and the relative positioning the orders are drawn element smaller than then there exists path from that directed often necessary for the edges connecting elements cross each but elements must never located within instructive exercise draw the hasse diagram for the set natural numbers that are smaller than equal ordered the divides relation even some infinite sets can diagrammed superimposing ellipsis finite this works well for the natural but fails for the where there immediate successor above however quite often one can obtain intuition related diagrams similar special elements within order partially ordered set there may some elements that play special the most basic example given the least element poset for the least element the positive integers and the empty set the least set under the subset formally element least element the notation frequently found for the least even when numbers are however orders sets this notation might inappropriate since the number not always example given the above divisibility order where the least element since divides all other the number that divided all other hence the greatest element the other frequent terms for the least and greatest elements bottom and top zero and unit least and greatest elements may fail the example the real numbers but they they are always consider the divisibility relation the set although this set has neither top nor the elements and have elements below while and have none such elements are called minimal and maximal respectively formally element minimal exchanging with yields the definition maximality the example there can many maximal elements and some elements may both maximal and minimal above however there least then the only minimal element the again infinite posets maximal elements not always exist the set all finite subsets given infinite ordered subset provides one many important tool ensure the existence maximal elements under certain conditions zorn lemma subsets partially ordered sets inherit the already applied this considering the subset the natural numbers with the induced divisibility now there are also elements poset that are special with respect some subset the this leads the definition upper bounds given subset some poset upper bound element that above all elements formally this means that lower bounds again are defined inverting the for lower bound the natural numbers subset the given set upper bound for these sets under the subset ordering given their union this upper bound quite the smallest set that contains all the hence have found the least upper bound set this concept also called supremum join and for set one writes for its least upper conversely the greatest lower bound known infimum meet and denoted these concepts play important role many applications order for two elements and one also writes and for and respectively for another consider again the relation natural the least upper bound two numbers the smallest number that divided both the least common multiple the greatest lower bounds turn are given the greatest common divisor duality the previous often noted that concept can defined just inverting the ordering former this the case for least and greatest for minimal and maximal for upper and lower and this general situation order given order can inverted just exchanging its pictorially flipping the hasse diagram this yields the called dual inverse opposite order every order theoretic definition has its the notion one obtains applying the definition the inverse since all concepts are this operation preserves the theorems partial for given mathematical one can just invert the order and replace all definitions their duals and one obtains another valid this important and since one obtains two theorems for the price some more details and examples can found the article duality order theory constructing new orders there are many ways construct orders out given the dual order one another important construction the cartesian product two partially ordered taken together with the product order pairs the ordering defined and only and notice carefully that there are three distinct meanings for the relation symbol this the disjoint union two posets another typical example order where the order just the union the original every partial order gives rise called strict order defining and not this transformation can inverted setting the two concepts are equivalent although some circumstances one can more convenient work with than the functions between orders reasonable consider functions between partially ordered sets having certain additional properties that are related the ordering relations the two the most fundamental condition that occurs this context monotonicity function from poset poset monotone order preserving implies noting strictly the two relations here are different since they apply different the converse this implication leads functions that are order reflecting functions above for which implies the other function may also order reversing antitone implies order embedding function between orders that both preserving and examples for these definitions are found for the function that maps natural number its successor clearly monotone with respect the natural any function from discrete from set ordered the identity order also mapping each natural number the corresponding real number gives example for order the set complement powerset example antitone important question when two orders are essentially when they are the same renaming order isomorphisms are functions that define such isomorphism monotone bijective function that has monotone this equivalent being surjective order hence the image embedding always isomorphic which justifies the term embedding more elaborate type functions given called galois connections monotone galois connections can viewed generalization since they constitute pair two functions converse which are not inverse each but that still have close another special type maps poset are closure operators which are not only but also idempotent and extensive inflationary these have many applications all kinds closures that appear besides being compatible with the mere order functions between posets may also behave well with respect special elements and for when talking about posets with least may seem reasonable consider only monotonic functions that preserve this which map least elements least binary infima exist then reasonable property might require that for all and all these and indeed many may compiled under the label limit preserving functions finally one can invert the switching from functions orders orders functions indeed the functions between two posets and can ordered via the pointwise order for two functions and have for all elements this occurs for example domain theory where function spaces play important special types orders many the structures that are studied order theory employ order relations with further even some relations that are not partial orders are special mainly the concept preorder has preorder relation that reflexive and but not necessarily each preorder induces equivalence relation between where equivalent and preorders can turned into orders identifying all elements that are equivalent with respect this several types orders can defined from numerical data the items the total order results from attaching distinct real numbers each item and using the numerical comparisons order the instead distinct items are allowed have equal numerical one obtains strict weak ordering requiring two scores separated fixed threshold before they may compared leads the concept semiorder while allowing the threshold vary item basis produces interval order additional simple but useful property leads called well orders for which all empty subsets have minimal generalizing orders from linear partial set well partially ordered all its empty subsets have finite number minimal many other types orders arise when the existence infima and suprema certain sets focusing this usually referred completeness one bounded posets posets with least and greatest element which are just the supremum and infimum the empty subset lattices which every empty finite set has supremum and complete lattices where every set has supremum and and directed complete partial orders that guarantee the existence suprema all directed subsets and that are studied domain theory partial orders with complements poc sets are posets having unique bottom element along with reversing such that however one can even all finite empty infima then can viewed total binary operation the sense universal algebra hence two operations and are and one can define new properties giving such this condition called distributivity and gives rise distributive lattices there are some other important distributivity laws which are discussed the article distributivity order theory some additional order structures that are often specified via algebraic operations and defining identities are heyting algebras and boolean algebras which both introduce new operation called negation both structures play role mathematical logic and especially boolean algebras have major applications computer science finally various structures mathematics combine orders with even more algebraic the case quantales that allow for the definition addition many other important properties posets for poset locally finite every closed interval finite locally finite posets give rise incidence algebras which turn can used define the euler characteristic finite bounded subsets ordered sets ordered one can define many types special subsets based the given simple example are upper sets sets that contain all elements that are above them the formally the upper closure set poset given the set there some with set that equal its upper closure called upper lower sets are defined more complicated lower subsets are ideals which have the additional property that each two their elements have upper bound within the their duals are given filters related concept that directed subset which like ideal contains upper bounds finite but does not have lower furthermore often generalized preordered subset which poset linearly called chain the opposite the antichain subset that contains two comparable that discrete related mathematical areas although most mathematical areas use orders one the other there are also few theories that have relationships which far beyond mere together with their major points contact with order some these are presented universal algebra already the methods and formalisms universal algebra are important tool for many order theoretic beside formalizing orders terms algebraic structures that satisfy certain one can also establish other connections example given the correspondence between boolean algebras and boolean rings other issues are concerned with the existence free such free lattices based given set furthermore closure operators are important the study universal topology topology orders play very prominent the set open sets provides classical example complete more precisely complete heyting algebra frame locale filters and nets are notions closely related order theory and the closure operator sets can used define beyond these topology can looked solely terms the open set which leads the study pointless topology furthermore natural preorder elements the underlying set topology given the called specialization order that actually partial order the topology conversely order one often makes use topological there are various ways define subsets order which can considered open sets especially interesting consider topologies poset that turn induce their specialization the finest such topology the alexandrov topology given taking all upper sets conversely the coarsest topology that induces the specialization order the upper topology having the complements principal ideals sets the form for some subbase additionally topology with specialization order may order consistent meaning that their open sets are inaccessible directed with respect the finest order consistent topology the scott topology which coarser than the alexandrov third important topology this spirit the lawson topology there are close connections between these topologies and the concepts order for function preserves directed suprema iff continuous with respect the scott topology for this reason this order theoretic property also called scott continuity category theory the visualization orders with hasse diagrams has straightforward instead displaying lesser elements below greater the direction the order can also depicted giving directions the edges this each order seen equivalent directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the elements the poset and there directed path from and only dropping the requirement being one can also obtain all when equipped with all transitive these graphs turn are just special categories where elements are objects and each set morphisms between two elements most functions between orders become functors between interestingly many ideas order theory are just concepts category theory for infimum just categorical product more one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion categorical limit colimit respectively another place where categorical ideas occur the concept galois connection which just the same pair adjoint functors but category theory also has its impact order theory larger classes posets with appropriate functions discussed above form interesting often one can also state constructions like the product order terms further insights result when categories orders are found categorically equivalent other for example topological this line research leads various representation theorems often collected under the label stone duality history explained orders are ubiquitous however earliest explicit mentionings partial orders are probably found not before the this context the works george boole are great moreover works charles sanders peirce richard dedekind and ernst der also consider concepts order certainly there are others named this context and surely there exists more detailed material the history order the term poset abbreviation for partially ordered set was coined garrett birkhoff the second edition his influential book lattice theory see also cyclic order hierarchy incidence algebra important publications order theory causal sets
