mathematics	polynomial navigation search has been suggested that polynomial expression merged into this discuss proposed since april graph mathematics polynomial expression consisting variables indeterminates and coefficients that involves only the operations addition subtraction multiplication and negative integer exponents example polynomial single indeterminate which quadratic polynomial polynomials appear wide variety areas mathematics and for they are used form polynomial equations which encode wide range from elementary word problems complicated problems the they are used define polynomial functions which appear settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics economics and social science they are used calculus and numerical analysis approximate other advanced polynomials are used construct polynomial rings and algebraic varieties central concepts algebra and algebraic geometry contents etymology notation and terminology definition arithmetic polynomials polynomial functions graphs polynomial functions polynomial equations solving polynomial equations polynomials associated other objects calculus abstract algebra divisibility other applications extensions the concept polynomial history history the notation see also notes references external links etymology according the oxford english dictionary polynomial succeeded the term binomial and was made simply replacing the latin root with the greek poly which comes from the greek word for many the word polynomial was first used the notation and terminology the occurring polynomial commonly called either variable indeterminate when the polynomial considered for fixed symbol which does not have any value its value indeterminate thus more correct call indeterminate however when one considers the function defined the then represents the argument the and therefore called variable many authors use these two words but this may sometimes confusing and not done this common convention use upper case letters for the indeterminates and the corresponding lower case letters for the variables the associated may confusing that polynomial the indeterminate may appear the formulas either normally the name the polynomial not however denotes another more generally any then denotes the result substituting for the polynomial defines the function then the definition implies this equality allows writing let shorthand for let polynomial the indeterminate the other when not necessary emphasize the name the many formulas are much simpler and easier read the the not appear each occurrence the definition polynomial single indeterminate can written the form where are more generally elements ring and symbol which called indeterminate for historical variable the symbol does not represent any although the usual distributive laws valid for arithmetic operations also apply this can expressed more concisely using summation notation that polynomial can either zero can written the sum finite number zero terms each term consists the product called the coefficient the term and finite number raised integer the exponent indeterminate term called the degree that indeterminate that the degree the term the sum the degrees the indeterminates that and the degree polynomial the largest degree any one term with nonzero since the degree indeterminate without written exponent term and polynomial with indeterminates are called respectively constant term and constant the degree constant term and nonzero constant polynomial the degree the zero polynomial which has not for the coefficient the indeterminates are and the degree while the degree the degree the entire term the sum the degrees each indeterminate this example the degree forming sum several terms produces for the following consists three the first degree the second degree and the third degree polynomials small degree have been given specific polynomial degree zero constant polynomial simply constant polynomials degree two three are respectively linear quadratic polynomials and cubic polynomials for higher degrees the specific names are not commonly although quartic polynomial for degree and quintic polynomial for degree are sometimes the names for the degrees may applied the polynomial its for the term linear term quadratic the polynomial which may considered have terms called the zero polynomial unlike other constant its degree not rather the degree the zero polynomial either left explicitly defined negative either these conventions are useful when defining euclidean division polynomials the zero polynomial also unique that the only polynomial having infinite number roots the case polynomials more than one polynomial called homogeneous degree all its terms have degree for homogeneous degree for more see homogeneous polynomial the commutative law addition can used rearrange terms into any preferred polynomials with one the terms are usually ordered according either descending powers with the term largest degree ascending powers the polynomial the example above written descending powers the first term has coefficient indeterminate and exponent the second the coefficient the third term since the degree zero polynomial the largest degree any one this polynomial has degree two terms with the same indeterminates raised the same powers are called similar like and they can using the distributive law into single term whose coefficient the sum the coefficients the terms that were may happen that this makes the coefficient polynomials can classified the number terms with nonzero that term polynomial called monomial term polynomial called binomial and polynomial one indeterminate called univariate polynomial polynomial more than one indeterminate called multivariate polynomial these notions refer more the kind polynomials one generally working with than individual for instance when working with univariate polynomials one does not exclude constant polynomials which may for from the subtraction constant although strictly speaking constant polynomials not contain any indeterminates possible further classify multivariate polynomials bivariate trivariate and according the maximum number indeterminates again that the set objects under consideration closed under study trivariate polynomials usually allows bivariate and also say simply polynomials and listing the indeterminates the evaluation polynomial consists substituting numerical value each indeterminate and carrying out the indicated multiplications and for polynomials one the evaluation usually more efficient lower number arithmetic operations using the horner scheme arithmetic polynomials polynomials can added using the associative law addition grouping all their terms together into single possibly followed and combining like for then which can simplified work out the product two polynomials into sum the distributive law repeatedly which results each term one polynomial being multiplied every term the for then which can simplified polynomial evaluation can used compute the remainder polynomial division polynomial degree since the remainder the division see the polynomial remainder theorem this more efficient than the usual algorithm division when the quotient not sum polynomials product polynomials composition two polynomials which obtained substituting variable the first polynomial the second the derivative the polynomial the polynomial the set the coefficients does not contain the integers for example the coefficients are integers modulo some prime number then should interpreted the sum with times for over the integers modulo the derivative the polynomial the polynomial primitive antiderivative the polynomial the polynomial where arbitrary for the antiderivatives have the form for the two kinds divisions are considered for the the euclidean division polynomials that generalizes the euclidean division the results two quotient and remainder that are characterized the following property the given two polynomials and such that there exists unique pair the and the such that and degree degree here the polynomial zero supposed have negative hand well with this division can computed the polynomial long division algorithm all polynomials with coefficients unique factorization domain for the integers field also have factored form which the polynomial written product irreducible polynomials and this factored form unique the order the factors and their multiplication invertible the case the field complex numbers the irreducible factors are over the real numbers they have the degree either one over the integers and the rational numbers the irreducible factors may have any for the factored form over the integers and the reals and over the complex the computation the factored called factorization too difficult done written however there are efficient polynomial factorization algorithms that are available most computer algebra systems formal quotient that algebraic fraction where the numerator and denominator are called rational expression rational and division polynomial however does yield another for considered valid term polynomial and polynomial because equivalent and just when this expression used its coefficient therefore for similar complex coefficients are one may have single term like even though looks like should expanded two the complex number one complex and the coefficient that the expression not polynomial because includes division constant the expression not because contains indeterminate used since subtraction can replaced addition the opposite and since positive integer exponents can replaced repeated all polynomials can constructed from constants and indeterminates using only addition and polynomial functions ring polynomial functions polynomial function function that can defined evaluating function one argument called polynomial function satisfies citation needed for all arguments where negative integer and are constant for the function taking real numbers real defined polynomial function one polynomial functions multiple variables can also using polynomials multiple example also the function which although look like polynomial function since for every from true that see chebyshev polynomials polynomial functions are class functions having many important they are all continuous smooth entire computable etc citation needed graphs polynomial functions polynomial degree polynomial degree polynomial degree polynomial degree polynomial degree polynomial degree polynomial function one real variable can represented graph the graph the zero polynomial the graph degree polynomial intercept the graph degree polynomial linear intercept slope the graph degree polynomial parabola the graph degree polynomial the graph any polynomial with degree greater and the graph constant polynomial always tends infinity when the variable increases indefinitely absolute value citation needed polynomial graphs are analyzed calculus using slopes concavity and end polynomial equations algebraic equation polynomial equation also called algebraic equation equation the form for polynomial case univariate polynomial the variable considered unknown and one seeks find the possible values for which both members the equation evaluate the same value general more than one solution may polynomial equation stands contrast polynomial identity like where both expressions represent the same polynomial different and consequence any evaluation both members gives valid elementary algebra methods such the quadratic formula are given for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations one there are also formulas for the cubic and quartic equations for higher the abel ruffini theorem asserts that there can not exist general formula however root finding algorithms may used find numerical approximations the roots polynomial equation any the number real solutions polynomial equation with real coefficients may not exceed the and equals the degree when the complex solutions are counted with their multiplicity this fact called the fundamental theorem algebra solving polynomial equations properties polynomial roots every polynomial corresponds where the occurrences are interpreted the argument called the polynomial function the equation setting the polynomial equation corresponding the solutions this equation are called the roots the they are the zeroes the function corresponding the points where the graph meets the number root and only the polynomial degree one divides may happen that divides more than divides then called multiple root and otherwise called simple root nonzero there highest power such that divides which called the multiplicity the root when the zero the corresponding polynomial equation and this case usually excluded when considering with the above definitions every number would root the zero with undefined multiplicity with this exception the number roots even counted with their respective cannot exceed the degree the relation between the roots polynomial and its coefficients described formulas some such not have any roots among the real numbers however the set allowed candidates expanded the complex numbers every constant polynomial has least one this the fundamental theorem algebra successively dividing out factors one sees that any polynomial with complex coefficients can written constant its leading times product such polynomial factors the number roots counted with their multiplicities exactly equal the degree the there difference between approximating roots and finding exact expressions for formulas for expressing the roots polynomials degree terms square roots have been known since ancient times see quadratic equation and for polynomials degree similar formulas using cube roots addition square were found the century see cubic function and quartic function for the formulas and niccol fontana tartaglia lodovico ferrari gerolamo cardano and vieta for historical but formulas for degree eluded niels henrik abel proved the striking result that there can general formula involving only arithmetic operations and that expresses the roots polynomial degree greater terms its coefficients see abel ruffini theorem variste galois studying the permutations the roots extended the abel ruffini theorem showing given polynomial one may decide solvable and solve this result marked the start galois theory and group theory two important branches modern galois himself noted that the computations implied his method were nevertheless formulas for solvable equations degrees and have been published see quintic function and sextic equation numerical approximations roots polynomial equations one unknown easily done computer the jenkins traub method laguerre method durand kerner method some other root finding algorithm for polynomials more than one indeterminate the notion root does not and there are usually infinitely many combinations values for the variables for which the polynomial function takes the value however for certain sets such polynomials may happen that for only finitely many combinations all polynomial functions take the value for set polynomial equations several there are algorithms decide they have finite number complex the number solutions there are algorithms compute the the methods underlying these algorithms are described the article systems polynomial equations the special case where all the polynomials are degree one called system linear equations for which another range different solution methods exist including the classical gaussian elimination polynomials associated other objects calculus calculus with polynomials polynomial interpolation the simple structure polynomial functions makes them quite useful analyzing general functions using polynomial important example calculus taylor theorem which roughly states that every differentiable function locally looks like polynomial and the stone weierstrass theorem which states that every continuous function defined compact interval the real axis can approximated the whole interval closely desired polynomial calculating derivatives and integrals polynomial functions particularly for the polynomial function the derivative with respect and the indefinite integral abstract algebra polynomial ring abstract algebra one distinguishes between polynomials and polynomial functions polynomial one indeterminate over ring defined formal expression the form where natural the coefficients are elements and formal whose powers are just placeholders for the corresponding coefficients that the given formal expression just way encode the sequence where there such that for all two polynomials sharing the same value are considered equal and only the sequences their coefficients are furthermore any polynomial equal any polynomial with greater value obtained from adding terms front whose coefficient these polynomials can added simply adding corresponding coefficients the rule for extending terms with zero coefficients can used make sure such coefficients thus each polynomial actually equal the sum the terms used its formal such term interpreted polynomial that has zero coefficients all powers other than then define suffices the distributive law describe the product any two such which given the rule natural numbers thus the set all polynomials with coefficients the ring forms itself the ring polynomials over which denoted the map from sending injective homomorphism which viewed subring commutative then algebra over one can think the ring arising from adding one new element and extending minimal way ring which satisfies other relations than the obligatory plus commutation with all elements that one must add all powers and their linear combinations formation the polynomial together with forming factor rings factoring out ideals are important tools for constructing new rings out known for the ring fact complex which can constructed from the polynomial ring over the real numbers factoring out the ideal multiples the polynomial another example the construction finite fields which proceeds starting out with the field integers modulo some prime number the coefficient ring see modular arithmetic then one can associate every polynomial polynomial function with domain and range equal more generally one can take domain and range the same unital associative algebra over one obtains the value substitution the value for the symbol one reason distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions that over some rings different polynomials may give rise the same polynomial function see fermat little theorem for example where the integers modulo this not the case when the real complex whence the two concepts are not always distinguished analysis even more important reason distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions that many operations polynomials like euclidean division require looking what polynomial composed expression rather than evaluating some constant value for divisibility polynomial greatest common divisor factorization polynomials commutative algebra one major focus study divisibility among integral domain and and are polynomials said that divides divisor there exists polynomial such that one can show that every zero gives rise linear more polynomial and element such that then the polynomial divides the converse also the quotient can computed using the polynomial long division field and and are polynomials with then there exist unique polynomials and with and such that the degree smaller than the degree using the convention that the polynomial has negative the polynomials and are uniquely determined and this called euclidean division division with remainder polynomial long division and shows that the ring euclidean domain analogously prime polynomials more irreducible polynomials can defined non zero polynomials which cannot factorized into the product two non constant polynomials the case coefficients non must replaced non constant non unit both definitions agree the case coefficients any polynomial may decomposed into the product invertible constant product irreducible the coefficients belong field unique factorization domain this decomposition unique the order the factors and the multiplication any non unit factor unit and division the unit factor the same when the coefficients belong rational numbers finite there are algorithms test irreducibility and compute the factorization into irreducible polynomials see factorization polynomials these algorithms are not practicable for hand written but are available any computer algebra system eisenstein criterion can also used some cases determine other applications orthogonal polynomial spline spline interpolation polynomials serve approximate other functions such the use splines polynomials are frequently used encode information about some other the characteristic polynomial matrix linear operator contains information about the eigenvalues the minimal polynomial algebraic element records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied that the chromatic polynomial graph counts the number proper colourings that the term polynomial can also used for quantities functions that can written polynomial for computational complexity theory the phrase polynomial time means that the time takes complete algorithm bounded polynomial function some such the size the extensions the concept polynomial rings polynomials finite number variables are fundamental importance algebraic geometry which studies the simultaneous zero sets several such multivariate these rings can alternatively constructed repeating the construction univariate polynomials with coefficient ring another ring thus the ring polynomials and can viewed the ring polynomials with coefficients polynomials the ring polynomials with coefficients polynomials these identifications are compatible with arithmetic operations they are isomorphisms but some notions such degree whether polynomial considered monic can change between these points one can construct rings polynomials infinitely many but since polynomials are expressions any individual polynomial can only contain finitely many citation needed bivariate polynomial where the second variable substituted exponential function applied the first for example may called exponential polynomial laurent polynomials are like but allow negative powers the quotients polynomials are called rational expressions rational and functions that evaluate rational expressions are called rational functions rational fractions are formal quotients polynomials they are formed from polynomials just rational numbers are formed from integers writing fraction two fractions related the canceling common factors are identified with each the rational function defined rational fraction the quotient the polynomial functions defined the numerator and the denominator the rational the rational fractions contain the laurent but not limit denominators powers while polynomial functions are defined for all values the rational function defined only for the values the variables for which the denominator not rational function produces rational output for any rational input for which this not true other functions such trigonometric functions logarithms and exponential functions citation needed formal power series are like but allow infinitely many zero terms that they not have finite unlike polynomials they cannot general explicitly and fully written down just like real numbers cannot but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same for
