seventeenth century for example the problem points christiaan huygens published book the subject and the century big work was done laplace what can considered today the classic initially probability theory mainly considered discrete events and its methods were mainly combinatorial eventually analytical considerations compelled the incorporation continuous variables into the this culminated modern probability foundations laid andrey nikolaevich kolmogorov kolmogorov combined the notion sample space introduced richard von mises and measure theory and presented his axiom system for probability theory fairly quickly this became the mostly undisputed axiomatic basis for modern probability theory but alternatives particular the adoption finite rather than countable additivity bruno finetti treatment most introductions probability theory treat discrete probability distributions and continuous probability distributions the more mathematically advanced measure theory based treatment probability covers both the the any mix these two and motivation consider experiment that can produce number the set all outcomes called the sample space the the power set the sample space formed considering all different collections possible for rolling honest die produces one six possible one collection possible results corresponds getting odd thus the subset element the power set the sample space die these collections are called events this the event that the die falls some odd the results that actually occur fall given that event said have probability way assigning every event value between zero and with the requirement that the event made all possible results our the event assigned value qualify probability distribution the assignment values must satisfy the requirement that you look collection mutually exclusive events events that contain common the events and are all mutually the probability that one the events will occur given the sum the probabilities the individual the probability that any one the events will occur this the same saying that the probability event this event encompasses the possibility any number except five being the mutually exclusive event has probability and the event has probability that absolute discrete probability distributions discrete probability distribution discrete probability theory deals with events that occur countable sample examples throwing dice experiments with decks cards random walk and tossing coins classical initially the probability event occur was defined number cases favorable for the over the number total outcomes possible equiprobable sample see classical definition probability for the event occurrence even number when die the probability given since faces out the have even numbers and each face has the same probability modern the modern definition starts with finite countable set called the sample space which relates the set all possible outcomes classical denoted then assumed that for each element intrinsic probability value which satisfies the following that the probability function lies between zero and one for every value the sample space and the sum over all values the sample space equal event defined any subset the sample space the probability the event defined the probability the entire sample space and the probability the null event the function mapping point the sample space the probability value called probability mass function abbreviated pmf the modern definition does not try answer how probability mass functions are instead builds theory that assumes their continuous probability distributions continuous probability distribution continuous probability theory deals with events that occur continuous sample classical the classical definition breaks down when confronted with the continuous see bertrand paradox modern the outcome space random variable the set real numbers subset then function called the cumulative distribution function cdf exists defined that returns the probability that will less than equal the cdf necessarily satisfies the following monotonically decreasing right continuous function absolutely continuous its derivative exists and integrating the derivative gives the cdf back then the random variable said have probability density function pdf simply density for set the probability the random variable being case the probability density function this can written whereas the pdf exists only for continuous random the cdf exists for all random variables including discrete random that take values these concepts can generalized for multidimensional cases and other continuous sample measure theoretic probability theory the raison tre the theoretic treatment probability that unifies the discrete and the continuous and makes the difference question which measure furthermore covers distributions that are neither discrete nor continuous nor mixtures the example such distributions could mix discrete and continuous for random variable that with probability and takes random value from normal distribution with probability can still studied some extent considering have pdf where the dirac delta function other distributions may not even for the cantor distribution has positive probability for any single neither does have the modern approach probability theory solves these problems using measure theory define the probability space given any set also called sample space and algebra measure defined called probability measure the borel algebra the set real then there unique probability measure for any and vice the measure corresponding cdf said induced the this measure coincides with the pmf for discrete variables and pdf for continuous making the theoretic approach free the probability set the algebra defined where the integration with respect the measure induced along with providing better understanding and unification discrete and continuous measure theoretic treatment also allows work probabilities outside the theory stochastic processes for example study brownian motion probability defined space probability distributions probability distributions certain random variables occur very often probability theory because they well describe many natural physical their distributions therefore have gained special importance probability some fundamental discrete distributions are the discrete uniform bernoulli binomial negative binomial poisson and geometric distributions important continuous distributions include the continuous uniform normal exponential gamma and beta distributions convergence random variables convergence random variables probability there are several notions convergence for random variables they are listed below the order any subsequent notion convergence the list implies convergence according all the preceding weak weakly distribution functions continuous convergence distribution most common shorthand convergence probability most common shorthand strong strongly almost sure convergence most common shorthand the names weak convergence weaker than strong strong convergence implies convergence and convergence probability implies weak the reverse statements are not always law large numbers law large numbers common intuition suggests that fair coin tossed many then roughly half the time will turn heads and the other half will turn tails furthermore the more often the coin the more likely should that the ratio the number heads the number tails will approach modern probability provides formal version this intuitive known the law large numbers this law remarkable because not assumed the foundations probability but instead emerges from these foundations since links theoretically derived probabilities their actual frequency occurrence the real the law large numbers considered pillar the history statistical theory and has had widespread the law large numbers states that the sample average sequence independent and identically distributed random variables converges towards their common expectation provided that the expectation the different forms convergence random variables that separates the weak and the strong law large numbers follows from the lln that event probability observed repeatedly during independent the ratio the observed frequency that event the total number repetitions converges towards for are independent bernoulli random variables taking values with probability and with probability then for all that converges almost surely central limit theorem central limit theorem the central limit theorem one the great results chapter explains the ubiquitous occurrence the normal distribution the theorem states that the average many independent and identically distributed random variables with finite variance tends towards normal distribution irrespective the distribution followed the original random formally let independent random variables with mean and variance then the sequence random variables converges distribution standard normal random notice that for some classes random variables the classic central limit theorem works rather fast berry esseen theorem for example the distributions with finite second and third moment from the exponential family the other hand for some random variables the heavy tail and fat tail variety works very slow may not work such cases one
