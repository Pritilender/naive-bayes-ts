triangle states that the square the hypotenuse the side opposite the right angle equal the sum the squares the other two the theorem can written equation relating the lengths the sides and often called the pythagorean equation where represents the length the and and represent the lengths the other two the pythagorean theorem named after the greek mathematician pythagoras who tradition credited with its proof although often argued that knowledge the theorem predates there evidence that babylonian mathematicians understood the although there little surviving evidence that they used mathematical mesopotamian indian and chinese mathematicians have all been known for independently discovering the some even providing proofs special the theorem has numerous proofs possibly the most any mathematical these are very including both geometric proofs and algebraic with some dating back thousands the theorem can generalized various including dimensional spaces that are not objects that are not right and objects that are not triangles but dimensional the pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics symbol mathematical mystique intellectual popular references plays

euclidean geometry spherical geometry hyperbolic geometry differential geometry history popular culture see also notes references external links pythagorean proof the pythagorean theorem was known long before but may well have been the first prove any the proof attributed him very and called proof the two large squares shown the figure each contain four identical and the only difference between the two large squares that the triangles are arranged therefore the white space within each the two large squares must have equal equating the area the white space yields the pythagorean that pythagoras originated this very simple proof sometimes inferred from the writings the later greek philosopher and mathematician proclus several other proofs this theorem are described but this known the pythagorean other forms the theorem pointed out the denotes the length the hypotenuse and and denote the lengths the other two the pythagorean theorem can expressed the pythagorean the length both and are then can calculated the length hypotenuse and one side are then the length the other side can calculated with the following the pythagorean equation relates the sides right triangle simple that the lengths any two sides are known the length the third side can another corollary the theorem that any right the hypotenuse greater than any one the other but less than their generalization this theorem the law cosines which allows the computation the length any side any given the lengths the other two sides and the angle between the angle between the other sides right the law cosines reduces the pythagorean other proofs the theorem this theorem may have more known proofs than any other the law quadratic reciprocity being another contender for that the book the pythagorean proposition contains proofs proof using similar triangles this proof based the proportionality the sides two similar triangles that upon the fact that the ratio any two corresponding sides similar triangles the same regardless the size the let abc represent right with the right angle located shown the draw the altitude from point and call its intersection with the side point divides the length the hypotenuse into parts and the new triangle ach similar triangle abc because they both have right angle definition the and they share the angle meaning that the third angle will the same both triangles marked the similar the triangle cbh also similar abc the proof similarity the triangles requires the triangle postulate the sum the angles triangle two right and equivalent the parallel postulate similarity the triangles leads the equality ratios corresponding the first result equates the cosine each angle and the second result equates the sines these ratios can written summing these two obtain tidying the pythagorean the role this proof history the subject much the underlying question why euclid did not use this but invented one conjecture that the proof similar triangles involved theory topic not discussed until later the elements and that the theory proportions needed further development that euclid proof elements here how the proof euclid elements proceeds the large square divided into left and right triangle constructed that has half the area the left then another triangle constructed that has half the area the square the most these two triangles are shown congruent proving this square has the same area the left this argument followed similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining putting the two rectangles together reform the square the its area the same the sum the area the other two the details let the vertices right with right angle drop perpendicular from the side opposite the hypotenuse the square the that line divides the square the hypotenuse into two each having the same area one the two squares the for the formal require four elementary lemmata two triangles have two sides the one equal two sides the each and the angles included those sides then the triangles are congruent side side the area triangle half the area any parallelogram the same base and having the same the area rectangle equal the product two adjacent the area square equal the product two its sides follows from next each top square related triangle congruent with another triangle related turn one two rectangles making the lower the proof let acb angled triangle with right angle each the sides and squares are cbde bagf and that the construction squares requires the immediately preceding theorems and depends upon the parallel from draw line parallel and will perpendicularly intersect and and respectively join and form the triangles bcf and angles cab and bag are both right therefore and are collinear similarly for and angles cbd and fba are both right therefore angle abd equals angle since both are the sum right angle and angle since equal and equal triangle abd must congruent triangle since straight parallel then rectangle bdlk has twice the area triangle abd because they share the base and have the same altitude line normal their common connecting the parallel lines and lemma since collinear with and square bagf must twice area triangle therefore rectangle bdlk must have the same area square bagf similarly can shown that rectangle ckle must have the same area square acih adding these two since therefore since cbde this which appears elements that demonstrates that the area the square the hypotenuse the sum the areas the other two this quite distinct from the proof similarity which conjectured the proof that pythagoras proof rearrangement have already discussed the pythagorean which was proof the same idea conveyed the leftmost animation which consists large side containing four identical right the triangles are shown two the first which leaves two squares and uncovered the second which leaves square uncovered the area encompassed the outer square never and the area the four triangles the same the beginning and the the black square areas must therefore second proof rearrangement given the middle large square formed with area from four identical right triangles with sides and fitted around small central then two rectangles are formed with sides and moving the combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares areas and which must have the same area the initial large the rightmost image also gives the upper two squares are divided shown the blue and green into pieces that when rearranged can made fit the lower square the hypotenuse conversely the large square can divided shown into pieces that fill the other this shows the area the large square equals that the two smaller algebraic proofs the theorem can proved algebraically using four copies right triangle with sides and arranged inside square with side the top half the the triangles are similar with area while the small square has side and area the area the large square therefore but this square with side and area similar proof uses four copies the same triangle arranged symmetrically around square with side shown the lower part the this results larger with side and area the four triangles and the square side must have the same area the larger giving related proof was published future president james garfield then representative instead square uses trapezoid which can constructed from the square the second the above proofs bisecting along diagonal the inner give the trapezoid shown the the area the trapezoid can calculated half the area the that the inner square similarly and there are only two triangles the proof proceeds above except for factor which removed multiplying two give the proof using differentials one can arrive the pythagorean theorem studying how changes side produce change the hypotenuse and employing calculus the triangle abc right shown the upper part the with the the same time the triangle lengths are measured with the hypotenuse length the side length and the side length seen the lower diagram increased small amount extending the side slightly then also increases these form two sides cde which with chosen perpendicular the right triangle approximately similar abc therefore the ratios their sides must the that this can rewritten this differential equation which solved give and the constant can deduced from give the equation this more intuitive proof than formal can made more rigorous proper limits are used place and converse the converse the theorem also for any three positive numbers and such that there exists triangle with sides and and every such triangle has right angle between the sides lengths and alternative statement for any triangle with sides then the angle between and measures this converse also appears elements book proposition triangle the square one the sides equals the sum the squares the remaining two sides the then the angle contained the remaining two sides the triangle can proven using the law cosines let abc triangle with side lengths and with construct second triangle with sides length and containing right the pythagorean follows that the hypotenuse this triangle has length the same the hypotenuse the first since both sides are the same lengths and the triangles are congruent and must have the same therefore the angle between the side lengths and the original triangle right the above proof the converse makes use the pythagorean theorem the converse can also proven without assuming the pythagorean corollary the pythagorean converse simple means determining whether triangle obtuse let chosen the longest the three sides and otherwise there triangle according the triangle inequality the following statements then the triangle then the triangle then the triangle edsger dijkstra has stated this proposition about right and obtuse triangles this sgn sgn where the angle opposite side the angle opposite side the angle opposite side and sgn the sign function consequences and uses the theorem pythagorean triples pythagorean triple pythagorean triple has three positive integers and such that other pythagorean triple represents the lengths the sides right triangle where all three sides have integer evidence from megalithic monuments northern europe shows that such triples were known before the discovery such triple commonly written some known examples are and primitive pythagorean triple one which and are coprime the greatest common divisor and the following list primitive pythagorean triples with values less than incommensurable lengths spiral theodorus one the consequences the pythagorean theorem that line segments whose lengths are incommensurable the ratio which not rational number can constructed using straightedge and compass pythagoras theorem enables construction incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse triangle related the sides the square root operation the figure the right shows how construct line segments whose lengths are the ratio the square root any positive each triangle has side labeled that the chosen unit for each right pythagoras theorem establishes the length the hypotenuse terms this hypotenuse related the unit the square root positive integer that not perfect realization length incommensurable with the such for more see quadratic irrational incommensurable lengths conflicted with the pythagorean concept numbers only whole the pythagorean school dealt with proportions comparison integer multiples common according one hippasus metapontum was drowned sea for making known the existence the irrational complex numbers for any complex number the absolute value modulus given the three and are related the pythagorean note that defined positive number zero but and can negative well geometrically the distance the from zero the origin the complex plane this can generalised find the distance between two and say the required distance given again they are related version the pythagorean euclidean distance various coordinate systems the distance formula cartesian coordinates derived from the pythagorean and are points the then the distance between also called the euclidean distance given more euclidean space the euclidean distance between two and generalization the pythagorean cartesian coordinates are not for polar coordinates are used two dimensions more general curvilinear coordinates are the formulas expressing the euclidean distance are more complicated than the pythagorean but can derived from typical example where the line distance between two points converted curvilinear coordinates can found the applications legendre polynomials physics the formulas can discovered using theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates cartesian for the polar coordinates can introduced then two points with locations and are separated distance performing the squares and combining the pythagorean formula for distance cartesian coordinates produces the separation polar coordinates using the trigonometric product sum formulas this formula the law cosines sometimes called the generalized pythagorean from this for the case where the radii the two locations are right the enclosed angle and the form corresponding theorem the pythagorean valid for right therefore special case the more general law valid for arbitrary pythagorean trigonometric identity pythagorean trigonometric identity right triangle with sides and hypotenuse trigonometry determines the sine and cosine the angle between side and the hypotenuse from that where the last step applies this relation between sine and cosine sometimes called the fundamental pythagorean trigonometric similar the ratios the sides are the same regardless the size the and depend upon the consequently the the triangle with hypotenuse unit size has opposite side size and adjacent side size units the relation the cross product the pythagorean theorem relates the cross product and dot product similar this can seen from the definitions the cross product and dot with unit vector normal both and the relationship follows from these definitions and the pythagorean trigonometric this can also used define the cross rearranging the following equation obtained this can considered condition the cross product and part its for example seven dimensions generalizations similar figures the three sides generalization the pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas squares the three sides similar figures was known hippocrates chios the fifth century and was included euclid his elements one erects similar figures see euclidean geometry with corresponding sides the sides right then the sum the areas the ones the two smaller sides equals the area the one the larger this extension assumes that the sides the original triangle are the corresponding sides the three congruent figures the common ratios sides between the similar figures are while proof only applied convex the theorem also applies concave polygons and even similar figures that have curved boundaries but still with part boundary being the side the original the basic idea behind this generalization that the area plane figure proportional the square any linear and particular proportional the square the length any thus similar figures with areas and are erected sides with corresponding lengths and then but the pythagorean conversely can prove that for three similar figures without using the pythagorean then can work backwards construct proof the for the starting center triangle can replicated and used triangle its and two similar right triangles and constructed the other two formed dividing the central triangle its altitude the sum the areas the two smaller triangles therefore that the thus and reversing the above logic leads the pythagorean theorem blue law cosines polar coordinates law cosines law cosines the pythagorean theorem special case the more general theorem relating the lengths sides any the law where the angle between sides and when degrees then cos and the formula reduces the usual pythagorean arbitrary triangle bit ibn qorra any selected angle general triangle sides inscribe isosceles triangle such that the equal angles its base are the same the selected suppose the selected angle opposite the side labeled inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle abd with angle opposite side and with side along second triangle formed with angle opposite side and side with length along shown the bit ibn qorra stated that the sides the three triangles were related the angle approaches the base the isosceles triangle and lengths and overlap less and when adb becomes right and the original theorem one proof observes that triangle abc has the same angles triangle abd but opposite the two triangles share the angle vertex both contain the angle and also have the same third angle the triangle postulate consequently abc similar the reflection abd the triangle dba the lower taking the ratio sides opposite and adjacent likewise for the reflection the other clearing fractions and adding these two the required general triangles using parallelograms area blue further generalization applies triangles that are not right using parallelograms the three sides place squares are special the upper figure shows that for scalene the area the parallelogram the longest side the sum the areas the parallelograms the other two provided the parallelogram the long side constructed indicated the dimensions labeled with arrows are the and determine the sides the bottom this replacement squares with parallelograms bears clear resemblance the original and was considered generalization pappus alexandria the lower figure shows the elements the focus the left side the the left green parallelogram has the same area the blue portion the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base and height however the left green parallelogram also has the same area the left green parallelogram the upper because they have the same base the upper left side the and the same height normal that side the repeating the argument for the right side the the bottom parallelogram has the same area the sum the two green solid geometry solid geometry terms solid pythagoras theorem can applied three dimensions consider rectangular solid shown the the length diagonal found from theorem where these three sides form right using horizontal diagonal and the vertical edge the length diagonal then found second application theorem doing all one this result the dimensional expression for the magnitude vector the diagonal terms its

cube then the square the area the face opposite the right angle corner the sum the squares the areas the other three this result can generalized the dimensional pythagorean let orthogonal vectors consider the dimensional simplex with vertices think the dimensional simplex with vertices not including the origin the hypotenuse and the remaining dimensional faces its legs then the square the volume the hypotenuse the sum the squares the volumes the legs this statement illustrated three dimensions the tetrahedron the the hypotenuse the base the tetrahedron the back the and the legs are the three sides emanating from the vertex the the depth the base from the vertex the area the legs increases while that the base the theorem suggests that when this depth the value creating right the

defined product the pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors and have here the vectors and are akin the sides right triangle with hypotenuse given the vector sum this form the

corresponding inner the pythagorean identity can extended sums more than two orthogonal are orthogonal vectors product then application the pythagorean theorem successive pairs these vectors described for dimensions the section solid geometry results the equation non euclidean geometry euclidean geometry axioms the pythagorean theorem derived from the axioms euclidean geometry and the pythagorean theorem given above does not hold non euclidean geometry the pythagorean theorem has been equivalent parallel postulate other euclidean the relation between the sides triangle must necessarily take pythagorean for spherical geometry all three sides the right triangle say and bounding octant the unit sphere have length equal and all its angles are right which violates the pythagorean theorem because here two cases euclidean geometry are spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry each the euclidean case for right the result replacing the pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law however the pythagorean theorem remains true hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry the condition that the triangle right replaced with the condition that two the angles sum the say the sides are then related the sum the areas the circles with diameters and equals the area the circle with diameter spherical geometry spherical geometry for any right triangle sphere radius for the figure right with sides the relation between the sides takes the this equation can derived special case the spherical law cosines that applies all spherical expressing the maclaurin series for the cosine function asymptotic expansion with the remainder term big notation can shown that the radius approaches infinity and the arguments and tend the spherical relation between the sides right triangle approaches the euclidean form the pythagorean substituting the asymptotic expansion for each the cosines into the spherical relation for right triangle yields note that the constants and have been absorbed into the big remainder terms since they are independent the radius this asymptotic relationship can further simplified multiplying out the bracketed cancelling the multiplying through and collecting all the error terms after multiplying through the euclidean pythagorean relationship recovered the limit the radius approaches infinity since the remainder term tends hyperbolic

this formula special form the hyperbolic law cosines that applies all hyperbolic with the angle the vertex opposite the side using the maclaurin series for the hyperbolic cosh can shown that hyperbolic triangle becomes very small that and all approach the hyperbolic relation for right triangle approaches the form differential geometry differential geometry cartesian coordinates polar
