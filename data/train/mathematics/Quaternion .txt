introducing more precise october mathematics the quaternions are number system that extends the complex numbers they were first described irish mathematician william rowan hamilton and applied mechanics three dimensional space feature quaternions that multiplication two quaternions noncommutative hamilton defined quaternion the quotient two directed lines dimensional space equivalently the quotient two vectors quaternions find uses both theoretical and applied particular for calculations involving dimensional rotations such three dimensional computer graphics and computer vision practical they can used alongside other such euler angles and rotation matrices alternative them depending the modern mathematical quaternions form dimensional associative normed division algebra over the real numbers and therefore also domain the quaternions were the first noncommutative division algebra the algebra quaternions often denoted for hamilton blackboard bold unicode can also given the clifford algebra classifications the algebra holds special place analysis according the frobenius theorem one only two dimensional division rings containing the real numbers proper subring the other being the complex these rings are also euclidean hurwitz algebras which quaternions are the largest associative algebra the unit quaternions can therefore thought choice group structure the sphere that gives the group spin which isomorphic and also the universal cover contents history historical impact physics definition multiplication basis elements noncommutativity multiplication hamilton product ordered list form scalar and vector parts conjugation the and reciprocal unit quaternion algebraic properties quaternions and the geometry matrix representations sums four squares quaternions pairs complex numbers square roots union complex planes commutative subrings functions quaternion variable exponential logarithm and power three dimensional and dimensional rotation groups generalizations quaternions the even part brauer group quotations see also notes external articles and resources books and publications links and monographs history history quaternions brougham bridge dublin ijk quaternion algebra was introduced hamilton important precursors this work included euler square identity and olinde rodrigues parameterization general rotations four parameters but neither these writers treated the parameter rotations carl friedrich gauss had also discovered quaternions but this work was not published until hamilton knew that the complex numbers could interpreted points plane and was looking for way the same for points dimensional space points space can represented their which are triples and for many years had known how add and subtract triples however hamilton had been stuck the problem multiplication and division for long could not figure out how calculate the quotient the coordinates two points the great breakthrough quaternions finally came monday october dublin when hamilton was his way the royal irish academy where was going preside council walked along the towpath the royal canal with his the concepts behind quaternions were taking shape his when the answer dawned hamilton could not resist the urge carve the formula for the ijk into the stone brougham bridge paused the following hamilton wrote letter his friend and fellow john graves describing the train thought that led his this letter was later published the london edinburgh and dublin philosophical magazine and journal science vol xxv the hamilton and here there dawned the notion that must some fourth dimension space for the purpose calculating with triples electric circuit seemed and spark flashed hamilton called quadruple with these rules multiplication quaternion and devoted most the remainder his life studying and teaching hamilton treatment more geometric than the modern which emphasizes algebraic properties founded school quaternionists and tried popularize quaternions several the last and longest his elements quaternions was pages was published shortly after his after his student peter tait continued promoting this quaternions were mandatory examination topic topics physics and geometry that would now described using such kinematics space and maxwell equations were described entirely terms there was even professional research the quaternion society devoted the study quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems from the quaternions began displaced vector analysis which had been developed josiah willard gibbs oliver heaviside and hermann von helmholtz vector analysis described the same phenomena borrowed some ideas and terminology liberally from the literature however vector analysis was conceptually simpler and notationally and eventually quaternions were relegated minor role mathematics and physics effect this transition that hamilton work difficult comprehend for many modern hamilton original definitions are unfamiliar and his writing style was wordy and difficult however quaternions have had revival since the late primarily due their utility describing spatial the representations rotations quaternions are more compact and quicker compute than the representations unlike euler angles they are not susceptible gimbal lock for this quaternions are used computer graphics computer vision robotics control theory signal processing attitude control physics bioinformatics molecular dynamics computer simulations and orbital mechanics for common for the control systems spacecraft commanded terms quaternions have received another boost from number theory because their relationships with the quadratic forms since the department mathematics the national university maynooth has organized where scientists including the physicists murray mann steven weinberg and the mathematician andrew wiles take walk from dunsink observatory the royal canal hamilton carving longer historical impact physics girard essay the quaternion group and modern physics discusses some roles quaternions shows how various physical covariance the lorentz the general relativity the clifford algebra and the conformal group can readily related the quaternion group modern algebra girard began discussing group representations and representing some space groups crystallography proceeded kinematics rigid body motion next used complex quaternions biquaternions represent the lorentz group special including the thomas precession cited five beginning with ludwik silberstein who use potential function one quaternion variable express maxwell equations single differential equation concerning general expressed the runge lenz vector mentioned the clifford biquaternions split biquaternions instance clifford algebra finally invoking the reciprocal girard described conformal maps spacetime among the fifty girard included alexander macfarlane and his bulletin the quaternion society showed how equations general relativity could formulated within clifford algebra that directly linked more personal view quaternions was written joachim lambek wrote his essay hamilton had quaternions physics own interest graduate student was raised the inspiring book concluded stating firmly believe that quaternions can supply shortcut for pure mathematicians who wish familiarize themselves with certain aspects theoretical definition the quaternions are equal dimensional vector space over the real numbers has three addition scalar and quaternion the sum two elements defined their sum elements similarly the product element real number defined the same the product scalar define the product two elements requires choice basis for the elements this basis are customarily denoted and every element can uniquely written linear combination these basis that where and are real numbers the basis element will the identity element meaning that multiplication does and for this elements are usually written suppressing the basis element given this associative quaternion multiplication defined first defining the products basis elements and then defining all other products using the distributive multiplication basis elements the identities where and are basis elements determine all the possible products and for example multiplying both sides ijk gives all the other possible products can determined similar resulting which can expressed table whose rows represent the left factor the product and whose columns represent the right shown the top this noncommutativity multiplication unlike multiplication real complex multiplication quaternions not commutative for while the noncommutativity multiplication has some unexpected among them that polynomial equations over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree the the equation for has infinitely many quaternion solutions with that these solutions lie the dimensional surface sphere centered zero the dimensional subspace quaternions with zero real this sphere intersects the complex plane two points and the fact that quaternion multiplication not commutative makes the quaternions cited example strictly skew field hamilton product for two elements and their called the hamilton product determined the products the basis elements and the distributive law the distributive law makes possible expand the product that sum products basis this gives the following now the basis elements can multiplied using the rules given above ordered list form using the basis makes possible write set quadruples then the basis elements and the formulas for addition and multiplication scalar and vector parts number the form where real called real and number the form where and are real and least one called pure imaginary any then called its scalar part and called its vector part the scalar part quaternion always and the vector part always pure even though every quaternion can viewed vector dimensional vector common define vector mean pure imaginary with this vector the same element the vector space important however that the vector part quaternion axial vector pseudovector not ordinary polar vector was formally proven altmann his book quaternions and double polar vector can represented calculations for when rotated quaternion similarity pure with loss but the two should not the axis binary deg rotation quaternion corresponds the direction the represented polar vector such hamilton called pure imaginary quaternions right quaternions and real numbers considered quaternions with zero vector scalar quaternions quaternion divided into scalar part and vector then the formulas for addition and multiplication where the dot product and the cross product conjugation the and reciprocal conjugation quaternions analogous conjugation complex numbers and transposition also known elements clifford algebras define let the conjugate the quaternion denoted conjugation involution meaning that its own conjugating element twice returns the original the conjugate product two quaternions the product the conjugates the reverse order that and are then not unlike the situation the complex the conjugation quaternion can expressed entirely with multiplication and conjugation can used extract the scalar and vector parts the scalar part and the vector part the square root the product quaternion with its conjugate called its norm and denoted hamilton called this quantity the tensor but this conflicts with modern meaning tensor this expressed this always negative real and the same the euclidean norm considered the vector space multiplying quaternion real number scales its norm the absolute value the that then this special case the fact that the norm multiplicative meaning that for any two quaternions and multiplicativity consequence the formula for the conjugate alternatively follows from the identity where denotes the usual imaginary unit and hence from the multiplicative property determinants square this norm makes possible define the distance between and the norm their this makes into metric space addition and multiplication are continuous the metric clarification needed unit quaternion versor unit quaternion quaternion norm dividing zero quaternion its norm produces unit quaternion called the versor every quaternion has polar decomposition using conjugation and the norm makes possible define the reciprocal the product quaternion with its reciprocal should equal and the considerations above imply that the product and either the reciprocal defined this makes possible divide two quaternions and two different that their quotient can either the notation ambiguous because does not specify whether divides the left the algebraic properties cayley graph the set all quaternions vector space over the real numbers with dimension the real numbers have dimension the complex numbers have dimension and the octonions have dimension multiplication for associative and distributes over vector but not therefore the quaternions are commutative associative algebra over the real even though contains copies the complex not associative algebra over the complex because possible divide they form division algebra this structure similar field except for the commutativity finite dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers are very the frobenius theorem states that there are exactly and the norm makes the quaternions into normed algebra and normed division algebras over the reals are also very hurwitz theorem says that there are only and the octonions the quaternions are also example composition algebra and unital banach algebra because the product any two basis vectors plus minus another basis the set forms group under this group called the quaternion group and denoted the real group ring ring which also dimensional vector space over has one basis vector for each element the quaternions are the quotient ring the ideal generated the elements and here the first term each the differences one the basis elements and and the second term one basis elements and not the additive inverses and quaternions and the geometry because the vector part quaternion vector the geometry reflected the algebraic structure the many operations vectors can defined terms and this makes possible apply quaternion techniques wherever spatial vectors for this true electrodynamics and computer graphics for the remainder this and will denote both imaginary basis vectors and basis for notice that replacing and sends vector its additive the additive inverse vector the same its conjugate for this conjugation sometimes called the spatial inverse choose two imaginary quaternions and their dot product this equal the scalar parts and note that the vector parts these four products are also has the formulas the cross product and relative the orientation determined the ordered basis and recall that the orientation necessary determine the this equal the vector part the product well the vector part also has the formula let and quaternions possibly and write where and are the scalar and and are the vector parts and then have the formula this shows that the noncommutativity quaternion multiplication comes from the multiplication pure imaginary also shows that two quaternions commute and only their vector parts are for further elaboration modeling dimensional vectors using see quaternions and spatial rotation matrix representations just complex numbers can represented matrices can there are least two ways representing quaternions matrices such way that quaternion addition and multiplication correspond matrix addition and matrix multiplication one use complex matrices and the other use real matrices each the representation given one family linearly related the terminology abstract algebra these are injective homomorphisms from the matrix rings and respectively using complex the quaternion can represented this representation has the following complex numbers correspond diagonal the norm quaternion the square root product with its with complex the square root the determinant the corresponding the conjugate quaternion corresponds the conjugate transpose the restricted unit this representation provides isomorphism between and the latter group important for describing spin quantum mechanics see pauli matrices using real that same quaternion can written this the conjugate quaternion corresponds the transpose the the fourth power the norm quaternion the determinant the corresponding complex numbers are block diagonal matrices with two blocks the multiplication two quaternions can represented matrix vector define and and are real column vectors constructed from can rewrite the multiplication can also define the and matrix constructions have the following basic sums four squares lagrange square theorem quaternions are also used one the proofs square theorem number theory which states that every nonnegative integer the sum four integer well being elegant theorem its own lagrange four square theorem has useful applications areas mathematics outside number such combinatorial design theory the based proof uses hurwitz quaternions subring the ring all quaternions for which there analog the euclidean algorithm quaternions pairs complex numbers cayley dickson construction quaternions can represented pairs complex from this quaternions are the result applying the cayley dickson construction the complex this generalization the construction the complex numbers pairs real let dimensional vector space over the complex choose basis consisting two elements and vector can written terms the basis elements and define and then can multiply two vectors using the distributive writing place the product leads the same rules for multiplication the usual therefore the above vector complex numbers corresponds the quaternion write the elements ordered pairs and quaternions then the correspondence square roots the complex there are just two and whose square there are infinitely many square roots minus the quaternion solution for the square root the surface the unit sphere see let and assume that its square terms and this means satisfy the last three either and are all the latter impossible because real number and the first equation would imply that therefore and other quaternion squares and only vector that pure with norm the set all such vectors forms the unit only negative real quaternions have infinite number square all others have just two one the case the identification the square roots minus one was given hamilton but was frequently omitted other the sphere was included sam perlis his three page exposition included historical topics algebra page published the national council teachers mathematics more the sphere square roots minus one described ian porteous book clifford algebras and the classical groups proposition page also conway quaternions and octonions read page any imaginary unit may called and perpendicular one and their product another statement the union complex planes each pair square roots creates distinct copy the complex numbers inside the then the copy determined the function the language abstract algebra each injective ring homomorphism from the images the embeddings corresponding and are every real quaternion lies subspace isomorphic write the sum its scalar part and its vector decompose the vector part further the product its norm and its note that this not the same the versor the vector part pure imaginary unit its square therefore determines copy the complex numbers the function under this the image the complex number thus the union complex planes intersecting common real line where the union taken over the sphere square roots minus bearing mind that the same plane associated with the antipodal points the commutative subrings the relationship quaternions each other within the complex subplanes can also identified and expressed terms commutative subrings specifically since two quaternions and commute only they lie the same complex subplane the profile union complex planes arises when one seeks find all commutative subrings the quaternion ring this method commutative subrings also used profile the coquaternions and real matrices functions quaternion variable quaternionic analysis like functions complex variable functions quaternion variable suggest useful physical for the original electric and magnetic fields described maxwell were functions quaternion exponential logarithm and power given the exponential computed and follows that the polar decomposition quaternion may written where the angle and the unit vector are defined and any unit quaternion may expressed polar form the power quaternion raised arbitrary exponent given three dimensional and dimensional rotation groups quaternions and spatial rotation rotation operator vector the term conjugation besides the meaning given can also mean taking element rar where some zero element all elements that are conjugate given element this sense the word have the same real part and the same norm the vector thus the conjugate the other sense one the conjugates this thus the multiplicative group zero quaternions acts conjugation the copy consisting quaternions with real part equal conjugation unit quaternion quaternion absolute value with real part rotation angle the axis the rotation being the direction the imaginary the advantages quaternions nonsingular representation compared with euler angles for more compact and than matrices pairs unit quaternions represent rotation space see rotations dimensional euclidean algebra rotations the set all unit quaternions versors forms sphere and group lie group under double covering the group real orthogonal matrices determinant since two unit quaternions correspond every rotation under the above point groups three dimensions the image subgroup versors point group and the preimage point group subgroup the preimage finite point group called the same with the prefix binary for the preimage the icosahedral group the binary icosahedral group the group isomorphic the group complex unitary matrices determinant let the set quaternions the form where and are either all integers all rational numbers with odd numerator and denominator the set ring fact domain and lattice and called the ring hurwitz quaternions there are unit quaternions this and they are the vertices cell regular polytope with schl fli symbol generalizations quaternion algebra any field with characteristic different from and and are elements one may define dimensional unitary associative algebra over with basis and where and these algebras are called quaternion algebras and are isomorphic the algebra matrices over form division algebras over depending the choice and quaternions the even part the usefulness quaternions for geometrical computations can generalised other identifying the quaternions the even part the clifford algebra this associative multivector algebra built from fundamental basis elements using the product rules these fundamental basis elements are taken represent vectors then turns out that the reflection vector plane perpendicular unit vector can two reflections make rotation angle twice the angle between the two reflection corresponds rotation the plane containing and this very similar the corresponding quaternion the two are make the identification and straightforward confirm that this preserves the hamilton relations this quaternions correspond not vectors but bivectors quantities with magnitude and orientations associated with particular planes rather than directions the relation complex numbers becomes too with two vector directions and there only one bivector basis element only one but with three vector there are three bivector basis elements three this reasoning extends the clifford algebra there are six bivector basis since with four different basic vector six different pairs and therefore six different linearly independent planes can rotations such spaces using these generalisations called rotors can very useful for applications involving homogeneous coordinates but only that the number basis bivectors equals the number basis and each bivector can identified pseudovector dorst identify the following advantages for placing quaternions this wider rotors are natural and mysterious geometric algebra and easily understood the encoding double geometric rotor and the objects acts live the same this eliminates the need change representations and encode new data structures and methods which required when augmenting linear algebra with rotor universally applicable any element the not just vectors and other but also planes circles spheres rays and the conformal model euclidean rotors allow the encoding translation and scaling single element the universally acting any this means that rotors can represent rotations around arbitrary whereas quaternions are limited axis through the rotor encoded transformations make interpolation particularly for further detail about the geometrical uses clifford see geometric algebra brauer group brauer group the quaternions are essentially the only central simple algebra over the real the sense that every csa over the reals brauer equivalent either the reals the explicitly the brauer group the reals consists two represented the reals and the where the brauer group the set all equivalence relation one csa being matrix ring over the artin wedderburn theorem wedderburn csas are all matrix algebras over division and thus the quaternions are the only trivial division algebra over the csas rings over which are simple algebras have trivial sided just with whose center exactly the field are noncommutative analog extension fields and are more restrictive than general ring the fact that the quaternions are the only trivial csa over the reals may compared with the fact that the complex numbers are the only trivial field extension the quotations this section contains too many quotations for encyclopedic entry please help improve the article editing take facts from excessively quoted
