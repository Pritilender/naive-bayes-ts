real numbers there are several ways defining the real number system ordered field the synthetic approach gives list axioms for the real numbers complete ordered field under the usual axioms set theory one can show that these axioms are the sense that there model for the and any two such models are isomorphic any one these models must explicitly and most these models are built using the basic properties the rational number system ordered these constructions are described more detail the main order properties the real numbers the real numbers have several important lattice theoretic properties that are absent the complex most the real numbers form ordered field which addition and multiplication preserve moreover the ordering the real numbers total and the real numbers have the least upper bound property these order theoretic properties lead number important results real such the monotone convergence theorem the intermediate value theorem and the mean value theorem however while the results real analysis are stated for real many these results can generalized other mathematical many ideas functional analysis and operator theory generalize properties the real numbers such generalizations include the theories riesz spaces and positive operators also mathematicians consider real and imaginary parts complex pointwise evaluation operator sequences sequences sequence sequence usually defined function whose domain countable totally ordered set although many disciplines the domain such the natural numbers sequence function from subset the natural numbers the real numbers other sequence map might identify for all just write limits limit limit the value that function sequence approaches the input index approaches some limits are essential calculus and mathematical analysis and are used define continuity derivatives and integrals continuity continuous function function from the set real numbers the real numbers can represented graph the cartesian plane such function continuous roughly the graph single unbroken curve with holes jumps there are several ways make this intuition mathematically these definitions are equivalent one the most convenient definition can used determine whether given function continuous the definitions function defined subset the set real this subset referred the domain some possible choices include the whole set real open interval closed interval and are real uniform continuity uniform continuity and are subsets the real numbers function called uniformly continuous for all there exists such that for all implies the difference between being uniformly and being simply continuous every that uniform continuity the value depends only and not the point the absolute continuity absolute continuity let interval the real line function absolutely continuous for every positive number there positive number such that whenever finite sequence pairwise disjoint sub intervals satisfies then the collection all absolutely continuous functions denoted the following conditions valued function compact interval are almost everywhere these equivalent conditions are satisfied then necessarily almost equivalence between and known the fundamental theorem lebesgue integral calculus due lebesgue series series given infinite sequence numbers series informally the result adding all those terms these can written more compactly using the summation symbol example the famous series from zeno dichotomy and its mathematical representation the terms the series are often produced according certain such formula algorithm taylor series taylor series the taylor series real complex valued function that infinitely differentiable real complex number the power series which can written the more compact sigma notation where denotes the factorial and denotes the derivative evaluated the point the derivative order zero defined itself and and are both defined the case that the series also called maclaurin fourier series fourier series decomposes periodic functions periodic signals into the sum possibly set simple oscillating namely sines and cosines complex exponentials the study fourier series branch fourier analysis differentiation differentiation formally the derivative the function the limit the derivative exists the function differentiable one can take higher derivatives iterating this one can classify functions their differentiability class the class consists all continuous the class consists all differentiable functions whose derivative such functions are called continuously differentiable thus function exactly function whose derivative exists and class the classes can defined recursively declaring the set all continuous functions and declaring for any positive integer the set all differentiable functions whose derivative contained for every and there are examples show that this containment the intersection the sets varies over the negative strictly contained integration riemann integration riemann integral the riemann integral defined terms riemann sums functions with respect tagged partitions let closed interval the real then tagged partition finite sequence this partitions the interval into sub intervals indexed each which tagged with distinguished point riemann sum function with respect such tagged partition defined thus each term the sum the area rectangle with height equal the function value the distinguished point the given and width the same the interval let the width interval then the mesh such tagged partition the width the largest interval formed the max the riemann integral function over the interval equal when the chosen tags give the maximum minimum value each the riemann sum becomes upper lower darboux sum suggesting the close connection between the riemann integral and the darboux integral lebesgue integration lebesgue integral lebesgue integration mathematical construction that extends the integral larger class also extends the domains which these functions can distributions distribution distributions generalized functions are objects that generalize functions distributions make possible differentiate functions whose derivatives not exist the classical any locally integrable function has distributional relation complex analysis real analysis area analysis that studies concepts such sequences and their continuity differentiation integration and sequences real analysis focuses the real numbers often including positive and negative infinity form the extended real line real analysis closely related complex analysis which studies broadly the same properties complex numbers complex natural define differentiation via holomorphic functions which have number useful such repeated expressability power series and satisfying the cauchy integral formula real usually more natural consider differentiable smooth harmonic functions which are more widely but may lack some more powerful properties holomorphic however results such the fundamental theorem algebra are simpler when expressed terms complex techniques from the theory analytic functions complex variable are often used real analysis such evaluation real integrals residue calculus important results important results include the bolzano weierstrass and heine borel theorems the intermediate value theorem and mean value theorem the fundamental theorem calculus and the monotone convergence theorem various ideas from real analysis can generalized from real space general metric spaces well measure spaces banach spaces
