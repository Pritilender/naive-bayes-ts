mathematics	real number navigation search baire space set floating point number real numbers mathematics real number value that represents quantity along continuous the real numbers include all the rational numbers such the integer and the fraction and all the irrational numbers such the square root two irrational algebraic number and transcendental number real numbers can thought points infinitely long line called the number line real line where the points corresponding integers are equally any real number can determined possibly infinite decimal representation such that where each consecutive digit measured units one tenth the size the previous the real line can thought part the complex plane and complex numbers include real number line these descriptions the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous the modern standards pure the discovery suitably rigorous definition the real indeed the realization that better definition was was one the most important developments century the currently standard axiomatic definition that real numbers form the unique archimedean complete totally ordered field isomorphism whereas popular constructive definitions real numbers include declaring them equivalence classes cauchy sequences rational dedekind cuts certain infinite decimal together with precise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order these definitions are equivalent the realm classical mathematics the reals are uncountable that while both the set all natural numbers and the set all real numbers are infinite sets there can one one function from the real numbers the natural the cardinality the set all real numbers denoted and called cardinality the continuum strictly greater than the cardinality the set all natural numbers denoted the statement that there subset the reals with cardinality strictly greater than and strictly smaller than known the continuum hypothesis known neither provable nor refutable using the axioms zermelo fraenkel set theory the standard foundation modern provided set theory consistent contents basic properties physics computation vocabulary and notations history definition axiomatic approach construction from the rational numbers properties completeness the complete ordered advanced properties generalizations and extensions reals set theory real numbers and logic see also notes references external links basic properties real number may either rational irrational either algebraic transcendental and either positive negative zero real numbers are used measure continuous quantities they may expressed decimal representations that have infinite sequence digits the right the decimal these are often represented the same form the ellipsis three indicates that there would still more digits more real numbers have the two basic properties being ordered field and having the least upper bound property the first says that real numbers comprise field with addition and multiplication well division zero which can totally ordered number line way compatible with addition and the second says empty set real numbers has upper bound then has real least upper bound the second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational for the set rational numbers whose square less than set with upper bound but least upper hence the rational numbers not satisfy the least upper bound physics the physical most physical constants such the universal gravitational and physical such mass speed and electric are modeled using real the fundamental physical theories such classical mechanics electromagnetism quantum mechanics general relativity and the standard model are described using mathematical typically smooth manifolds hilbert spaces that are based the real numbers although actual measurements physical quantities are finite accuracy and precision some recent developments theoretical physics stemming from the holographic principle the universe seen fundamentally information essentially zeroes and organized much less geometrical fashion and manifesting itself time and particle fields only more superficial this approach removes the real number system from its foundational role physics and even prohibits the existence infinite precision real numbers the physical universe considerations based the bekenstein bound computation with some exceptions most calculators not operate real instead they work with precision approximations called floating point numbers most scientific computation uses point real numbers satisfy the usual rules arithmetic but floating point numbers not computers cannot directly store arbitrary real numbers with infinitely many the precision limited the number bits allocated store whether floating point numbers arbitrary precision numbers however computer algebra systems can operate irrational quantities exactly manipulating formulas for them such rather than their rational decimal however not general possible determine whether two such expressions are equal the constant problem real number called computable there exists algorithm that yields its because there are only countably many but uncountable number almost all real numbers fail moreover the equality two computable numbers undecidable problem some constructivists accept the existence only those reals that are the set definable numbers but still only vocabulary and notations mathematicians use the symbol alternatively the letter blackboard bold encoded unicode double struck capital represent the set all real this set naturally endowed with the structure field the expression field real numbers frequently used when its algebraic properties are under the sets positive real numbers and negative real numbers are often denoted and respectively and are also the negative real numbers can denoted but one often sees this set simply denoted french the positive real and negative real commonly include zero and these sets are noted and this the respective sets without zero are strictly positive real numbers and strictly negative real and are the notation refers the cartesian product copies which dimensional vector space over the field the real this vector space may identified the dimensional space euclidean geometry soon coordinate system has been chosen the for value from consists three real numbers and specifies the coordinates point dimensional real used meaning that the underlying field the field the real numbers the real field for example real matrix real polynomial and real lie algebra the real used almost strictly reference the real numbers themselves the set all history simple fractions have been used the egyptians around the vedic sulba sutras the rules include what may the first use irrational numbers the concept irrationality was implicitly accepted early indian mathematicians since manava who were aware that the square roots certain numbers such and could not exactly around the greek mathematicians led pythagoras realized the need for irrational particular the irrationality the square root the middle ages brought the acceptance zero negative integral and fractional numbers first indian and chinese mathematicians and then arabic mathematicians who were also the first treat irrational numbers algebraic which was made possible the development algebra arabic mathematicians merged the concepts number and magnitude into more general idea real the egyptian mathematician mil ibn aslam was the first accept irrational numbers solutions quadratic equations coefficients equation often the form square cube roots and fourth roots the simon stevin created the basis for modern decimal notation and insisted that there difference between rational and irrational numbers this the descartes introduced the term real describe roots distinguishing them from imaginary ones the and centuries there was much work irrational and transcendental numbers johann heinrich lambert gave the first flawed proof that cannot citation needed marie legendre completed the and showed that not the square root rational paolo ruffini and niels henrik abel both constructed proofs the abel ruffini theorem that the general quintic higher equations cannot solved general formula involving only arithmetical operations and variste galois developed techniques for determining whether given equation could solved which gave rise the field galois theory joseph liouville showed that neither nor can root integer quadratic equation and then established the existence transcendental the proof being subsequently displaced georg cantor charles hermite first proved that and ferdinand von lindemann showed that lindemann proof was much simplified weierstrass still further david hilbert and has finally been made elementary adolf hurwitz and paul gordan the development calculus the century used the entire set real numbers without having defined them the first rigorous definition was given georg cantor showed that the set all real numbers uncountably infinite but the set all algebraic numbers countably infinite contrary widely held his first method was not his famous diagonal argument which published see cantor first uncountability proof definition construction the real numbers the real number system can defined axiomatically isomorphism which described there are also many ways construct the real number for starting from natural then defining rational numbers and finally defining real numbers equivalence classes their cauchy sequences dedekind cuts which are certain subsets rational another possibility start from some rigorous axiomatization euclidean geometry tarski and then define the real number system from the structuralist point view all these constructions are equal axiomatic approach let denote the set all real then the set field meaning that addition and multiplication are defined and have the usual the field ordered meaning that there total order such for all real numbers and then and then the order dedekind complete that every non empty subset with upper bound has least upper bound also called the last property what differentiates the reals from the rationals for the set rationals with square less than has rational upper bound but rational least upper because the square root not the real numbers are uniquely specified the above more given any two complete ordered fields and there exists unique field isomorphism from allowing think them essentially the same mathematical for another axiomatization see tarski axiomatization the reals construction from the rational numbers the real numbers can constructed completion the rational numbers such way that sequence defined decimal binary expansion converges unique real this case for details and other constructions real see construction the real numbers properties completeness completeness the real numbers main reason for using real numbers that the reals contain all limits more every sequence real numbers having the property that consecutive terms the sequence become arbitrarily close each other necessarily has the property that after some term the sequence the remaining terms are arbitrarily close some specific real mathematical this means that the reals are complete the sense metric spaces uniform spaces which different sense than the dedekind completeness the order the previous this formally defined the following sequence real numbers called cauchy sequence for any there exists integer possibly depending such that the distance less than for all and that are both greater than other sequence cauchy sequence its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close each sequence converges the limit for any there exists integer possibly depending such that the distance less than provided that greater than other sequence has limit its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close notice that every convergent sequence cauchy the converse also every cauchy sequence real numbers convergent real that the reals are note that the rationals are not for the sequence where each term adds digit the decimal expansion the positive square root cauchy but does not converge rational the real converges the positive square root the existence limits cauchy sequences what makes calculus work and great practical the standard numerical test determine sequence has limit test cauchy the limit typically not known for the standard series the exponential function converges real number because for every the sums can made arbitrarily small choosing sufficiently this proves that the sequence know that the sequence converges even the limit not known the complete ordered the real numbers are often described the complete ordered phrase that can interpreted several first order can lattice complete easy see that ordered field can because can have largest element given any this not the sense that additionally order can dedekind complete defined the section axioms the uniqueness result the end that section justifies using the word the the phrase complete ordered when this the sense complete that this sense completeness most closely related the construction the reals from dedekind since that construction starts from ordered field the and then forms the completion standard these two notions completeness ignore the field however ordered group this the additive group the defines uniform structure and uniform structures have notion completeness the description the previous section completeness special refer the notion completeness uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for metric spaces since the definition metric space relies already having characterization the real not true that the only uniformly complete ordered but the only uniformly complete archimedean field and indeed one often hears the phrase complete archimedean instead complete ordered every uniformly complete archimedean field must also complete and vice justifying using the the phrase the complete archimedean this sense completeness most closely related the construction the reals from cauchy sequences the construction carried out full this since starts with archimedean field the and forms the uniform completion standard but the original use the phrase complete archimedean was david hilbert who meant still something else meant that the real numbers form the largest archimedean field the sense that every other archimedean field subfield thus complete the sense that nothing further can added without making longer archimedean this sense completeness most closely related the construction the reals from surreal numbers since that construction starts with proper class that contains every ordered field the and then selects from the largest archimedean advanced properties real line the reals are uncountable that there are strictly more real numbers than natural numbers even though both sets are infinite the cardinality the reals equals that the set subsets the power the natural and cantor diagonal argument states that the latter cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality since the set algebraic numbers almost all real numbers are transcendental the existence subset the reals with cardinality strictly between that the integers and the reals known the continuum hypothesis the continuum hypothesis can neither proved nor independent from the axioms set theory topological the real numbers are separable this because the set which dense the real the irrational numbers are also dense the real however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality the the real numbers form metric space the distance between and defined the absolute value virtue being totally ordered set they also carry order topology the topology arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are but yield different presentations for the the order topology ordered the metric topology the dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology while the cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology the reals are contractible hence connected and simply connected separable and complete metric space hausdorff dimension the real numbers are locally compact but not compact there are various properties that uniquely specify for all connected and separable order topologies are necessarily homeomorphic the every nonnegative real number has square root although negative number this shows that the order determined its algebraic also every polynomial odd degree admits least one real these two properties make the premier example real closed field proving this the first half one proof the fundamental theorem algebra the reals carry canonical measure the lebesgue measure which the haar measure their structure topological group normalized such that the unit interval has measure there exist sets real numbers that are not lebesgue vitali sets the supremum axiom the reals refers subsets the reals and therefore order logical not possible characterize the reals with first order logic alone the skolem theorem implies that there exists countable dense subset the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences order logic the real numbers the set hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences ordered fields that satisfy the same order sentences are called nonstandard models this what makes nonstandard analysis work proving order statement some nonstandard model which may easier than proving know that the same statement must also true the field real numbers extension field the field rational and can therefore seen vector space over zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom choice guarantees the existence basis this vector there exists set real numbers such that every real number can written uniquely finite linear combination elements this using rational coefficients and such that element rational linear combination the however this existence theorem purely such base has never been explicitly the well ordering theorem implies that the real numbers can well ordered the axiom choice there exists total order with the property that every non empty subset has least element this the standard ordering the real numbers not ordering since open interval does not contain least element this again the existence such ordering purely cannot explicitly generalizations and extensions the real numbers can generalized and extended several different the complex numbers contain solutions all polynomial equations and hence are algebraically closed field unlike the real however the complex numbers are not ordered field the affinely extended real number system adds two elements and compact space longer not even additive but still has total order moreover complete lattice the real projective line adds only one value also compact again longer not even additive however allows division zero element not ordered the long real line pastes together copies the real line plus single point here denotes the reversed ordering create ordered set that locally identical the real but somehow for there preserving embedding the long real line but not the real the long real line the largest ordered set that complete and locally with the previous two this set longer field additive ordered fields extending the reals are the hyperreal numbers and the surreal numbers both them contain infinitesimal and infinitely large numbers and are therefore non archimedean ordered fields self adjoint operators hilbert space for self adjoint square complex matrices generalize the reals many they can ordered though not totally they are all their eigenvalues are real and they form real associative algebra positive definite operators correspond the positive reals and normal operators correspond the complex reals set theory set theory specifically descriptive set theory the baire space used surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties that are technical elements baire space are referred reals real numbers and logic the real numbers are most often formalized using the zermelo fraenkel axiomatization set but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations the real numbers are also studied reverse mathematics and constructive mathematics the hyperreal numbers developed edwin hewitt abraham robinson and others extend the set the real numbers introducing infinitesimal and infinite allowing for building infinitesimal calculus way closer the original intuitions leibniz euler cauchy and edward nelson internal set theory enriches the zermelo fraenkel set theory syntactically introducing unary predicate standard this infinitesimals are standard elements the set the real numbers rather than being elements extension the continuum hypothesis posits that the cardinality the set the real numbers the smallest infinite cardinal number after the cardinality the paul cohen proved that axiom independent the other axioms set that one may choose either the continuum hypothesis its negation axiom set without see also complex number continued fraction imaginary number limit sequence real
