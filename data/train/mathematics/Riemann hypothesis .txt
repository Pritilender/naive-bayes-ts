external links riemann zeta function the riemann zeta function defined for complex with real part greater than the absolutely convergent infinite series leonhard euler showed that this series equals the euler product where the infinite product extends over all prime numbers and again converges for complex with real part greater than the convergence the euler product shows that has zeros this none the factors have the riemann hypothesis discusses zeros outside the region convergence this must analytically continued all complex this can done expressing terms the dirichlet eta function the real part greater than then the zeta function satisfies the series the right converges not just when greater than but more generally whenever has positive real thus this alternative series extends the zeta function from the larger domain excluding the zeros see dirichlet eta function the zeta function can extended these taking giving finite value for all values with positive real part except for simple pole the strip the zeta function satisfies the functional equation one may then define for all remaining nonzero complex numbers assuming that this equation holds outside the strip and letting equal the hand side the equation whenever has positive real negative even integer then because the factor vanishes these are the trivial zeros the zeta positive even integer this argument does not apply because the zeros sin are cancelled the poles the gamma function takes negative integer the value not determined the functional but the limiting value approaches the functional equation also implies that the zeta function has zeros with negative real part other than the trivial all trivial zeros lie the critical strip where has real part between and history ist sehr dass alle wurzeln reell

riemann his paper the number primes less than given magnitude riemann found explicit formula for the number primes less than given number his formula was given terms the related function which counts the primes and prime powers counting prime power the number primes can recovered from this function where the bius function riemann formula then where the sum over the nontrivial zeros the zeta

the zeros the zeta function need some care their definition has branch points and and are defined for analytic continuation the complex variable the region they should considered the other terms also correspond the dominant term comes from the pole considered zero multiplicity and the remaining small terms come from the trivial for some graphs the sums the first few terms this series see riesel zagier this formula says that the zeros the riemann zeta function control the oscillations primes around their expected positions riemann knew that the trivial zeros the zeta function were symmetrically distributed about the line and knew that all its trivial zeros must lie the range checked that few the zeros lay the critical line with real part and suggested that they all this the riemann consequences the riemann hypothesis the practical uses the riemann hypothesis include many propositions known true under the riemann and some that can shown equivalent the riemann distribution

equivalent schoenfeld also showed that the riemann hypothesis equivalent where chebyshev second function growth arithmetic functions the riemann hypothesis implies strong bounds the growth many other arithmetic addition the primes counting function one example involves the bius function the statement that the equation valid for every with real part greater than with the sum the right hand side equivalent the riemann from this can also conclude that the mertens function defined then the claim that for every positive equivalent the riemann hypothesis littlewood see for paragraph titchmarsh for the meaning these see big notation the determinant the order redheffer matrix equal the riemann hypothesis can also stated condition the growth these the riemann hypothesis puts rather tight bound the growth since odlyzko riele disproved the slightly stronger mertens conjecture the riemann hypothesis equivalent many other conjectures about the rate growth other arithmetic functions aside from typical example robin theorem robin which states that the divisor function given then for all and only the riemann hypothesis where the euler mascheroni constant another example was found franel and extended landau see franel landau the riemann hypothesis equivalent several statements showing that the terms the farey sequence are fairly one such equivalence the farey sequence order beginning with and then the claim that for all equivalent the riemann here the number terms the farey sequence order for example from group landau function given the maximal order elements the symmetric group degree then massias nicolas robin showed that the riemann hypothesis equivalent the bound for all sufficiently large lindel hypothesis and growth the zeta function the riemann hypothesis has various weaker consequences one the lindel hypothesis the rate growth the zeta function the critical which says for any the riemann hypothesis also implies quite sharp bounds for the growth rate the zeta function other regions the critical for implies that the growth rate and its inverse would known factor titchmarsh large prime gap conjecture the prime number theorem implies that the gap between the prime and its successor however some gaps between primes may much larger than the cram proved assuming the riemann every gap this case which even the best bound that can proved using the riemann hypothesis far weaker than what seems cram conjecture implies that every gap which while larger than the average far smaller than the bound implied the riemann numerical evidence supports conjecture nicely criteria equivalent the riemann hypothesis many statements equivalent the riemann hypothesis have been though far none them have led much progress proving some typical examples are others involve the divisor function the riesz criterion was given riesz the effect that the bound holds for all and only the riemann hypothesis nyman proved that the riemann hypothesis true and only the space functions the form where the fractional part and dense the hilbert space integrable functions the unit beurling extended this showing that the zeta function has zeros with real part greater than and only this function space dense salem showed that the riemann hypothesis true and only the integral equation has trivial bounded solutions for weil criterion the statement that the positivity certain function equivalent the riemann related criterion statement that the positivity certain sequence numbers equivalent the riemann speiser proved that the riemann hypothesis equivalent the statement that the derivative has zeros the strip that has only simple zeros the critical line equivalent its derivative having zeros the critical consequences the generalized riemann hypothesis several applications use the generalized riemann hypothesis for dirichlet series zeta functions number fields rather than just the riemann many basic properties the riemann zeta function can easily generalized all dirichlet plausible that method that proves the riemann hypothesis for the riemann zeta function would also work for the generalized riemann hypothesis for dirichlet several results first proved using the generalized riemann hypothesis were later given unconditional proofs without using though these were usually much many the consequences the following list are taken from conrad gronwall showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that list imaginary quadratic fields with class number though stark and heegner later gave unconditional proofs this without using the generalized riemann hardy and littlewood showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies conjecture chebyshev that hardy and littlewood showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies weak form the goldbach conjecture for odd that every sufficiently large odd number the sum three though vinogradov gave unconditional deshouillers effinger and zinoviev showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that every odd number greater than the sum three chowla showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that the first prime the arithmetic progression mod most for some fixed constant hooley showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies artin conjecture primitive roots weinberger showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that list idoneal numbers weinberger showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis for the zeta functions all algebraic number fields implies that any number field with class number either euclidean imaginary quadratic number field discriminant miller showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that one can test number prime polynomial time via the miller test manindra neeraj kayal and nitin saxena proved this result unconditionally using the aks primality test odlyzko discussed how the generalized riemann hypothesis can used give sharper estimates for discriminants and class numbers number ono soundararajan showed that the generalized riemann hypothesis implies that ramanujan integral quadratic form represents all integers that represents with exactly exceptions excluded middle some consequences the are also consequences its and are thus their discussion the hecke deuring mordell heilbronn theorem ireland rosen say the method proof here truly the generalized riemann hypothesis then the theorem the generalized riemann hypothesis then the theorem thus the theorem punctuation care should taken understand what meant saying the generalized riemann hypothesis one should specify exactly which class dirichlet series has littlewood theorem this concerns the sign the error the prime number theorem has been computed that for all and value known for which see this table littlewood proved that there are arbitrarily large values for which and that there are also arbitrarily large values for which thus the difference changes sign infinitely many skewes number estimate the value corresponding the first sign littlewood proof divided into two the assumed false about half page ingham chapt and the assumed true about dozen gauss class number conjecture this the conjecture first stated article disquisitiones arithmeticae that there are only finite number imaginary quadratic fields with given class one way prove would show that the discriminant the class number the following sequence theorems involving the riemann hypothesis described ireland rosen theorem let the discriminant imaginary quadratic number field assume the generalized riemann hypothesis for functions all imaginary

character strictly mean grh but that was not the kind failure grh that heilbronn had his assumption was more restricted than simply grh false carl siegel later strengthened the result without using grh any growth totient nicolas proved ribenboim that for infinitely many where euler totient function and euler constant ribenboim remarks the method proof that the inequality shown first under the assumption that the riemann hypothesis secondly under the contrary generalizations and analogs the riemann hypothesis dirichlet series and other number fields the riemann hypothesis can generalized replacing the riemann zeta function the formally but much more global functions this broader one expects the trivial zeros the global functions have real part these rather than the classical riemann hypothesis only for the single riemann zeta which account for the true importance the riemann hypothesis the generalized riemann hypothesis extends the riemann hypothesis all dirichlet functions particular implies the conjecture that siegel zeros zeros functions between and not the extended riemann hypothesis extends the riemann hypothesis all dedekind zeta functions algebraic number fields the extended riemann hypothesis for abelian extension the rationals equivalent the generalized riemann the riemann hypothesis can also extended the functions hecke characters number the grand riemann hypothesis extends all automorphic zeta functions such mellin transforms hecke eigenforms function fields and zeta functions varieties over finite fields artin introduced global zeta functions function fields and conjectured analogue the riemann hypothesis for which has been proven hasse the genus case and weil for the fact that the gauss sum the quadratic character finite field size with odd has absolute value actually instance the riemann hypothesis the function field this led weil conjecture similar statement for all algebraic varieties the resulting weil conjectures were proven pierre deligne arithmetic zeta functions arithmetic schemes and their factors arithmetic zeta functions generalise the riemann and dedekind zeta functions well the zeta functions varieties over finite fields every arithmetic scheme scheme finite type over the arithmetic zeta function regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme kronecker dimension can factorized into the product appropriately defined factors and auxiliary factor jean pierre serre assuming functional equation and meromorphic the generalized riemann hypothesis for the factor states that its zeros inside the critical strip lie the central correspondingly the generalized riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function regular connected equidimensional arithmetic scheme states that its zeros inside the critical strip lie vertical lines and its poles inside the critical strip lie vertical lines this known for schemes positive characteristic and follows from pierre deligne but remains entirely unknown characteristic selberg zeta functions selberg zeta function selberg introduced the selberg zeta function riemann these are similar the riemann zeta they have functional and infinite product similar the euler product but taken over closed geodesics rather than the selberg trace formula the analogue for these functions the explicit formulas prime number selberg proved that the selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue the riemann with the imaginary parts their zeros related the eigenvalues the laplacian operator the riemann ihara zeta functions the ihara zeta function finite graph analogue the selberg zeta function introduced yasutaka regular finite graph ramanujan graph mathematical model efficient communication and only its ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue the riemann hypothesis was pointed out sunada montgomery pair correlation conjecture montgomery suggested the pair correlation conjecture that the correlation functions the suitably zeros the zeta function should the same those the eigenvalues random hermitian matrix odlyzko showed that this supported large scale numerical calculations these correlation montgomery showed that assuming the riemann least all zeros are and related conjecture that all zeros the zeta function are simple more generally have trivial integer linear relations between their imaginary dedekind zeta functions algebraic number which generalize the riemann zeta often have multiple complex citation needed this because the dedekind zeta functions factorize product powers artin functions zeros artin functions sometimes give rise multiple zeros dedekind zeta other examples zeta functions with multiple zeros are the functions some elliptic curves these can have multiple zeros the real point their critical the birch dyer conjecture predicts that the multiplicity this zero the rank the elliptic other zeta functions there are many other examples zeta functions with analogues the riemann some which have been goss zeta functions function fields have riemann proved sheats the main conjecture iwasawa theory proved barry mazur and andrew wiles for cyclotomic fields and wiles for totally real fields identifies the zeros adic function with the eigenvalues can thought analogue the hilbert lya conjecture for adic functions wiles attempts prove the riemann hypothesis several mathematicians have addressed the riemann but none their attempts have yet been accepted correct watkins lists some incorrect and more are frequently announced operator theory hilbert lya conjecture hilbert and polya suggested that one way derive the riemann hypothesis would find self adjoint operator from the existence which the statement the real parts the zeros would follow when one applies the criterion real eigenvalues some support for this idea comes from several analogues the riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond eigenvalues some the zeros zeta function variety over finite field correspond eigenvalues frobenius element tale cohomology group the zeros selberg zeta function are eigenvalues laplacian operator riemann and the zeros adic zeta function correspond eigenvectors galois action ideal class groups odlyzko showed that the distribution the zeros the riemann zeta function shares some statistical properties with the eigenvalues random matrices drawn from the gaussian unitary ensemble this gives some support the lya michael berry and jon keating conjectured that there some unknown quantization the classical hamiltonian that and even more that the riemann zeros coincide with the spectrum the operator this contrast canonical quantization which leads the heisenberg uncertainty principle and the natural numbers spectrum the quantum harmonic oscillator the crucial point that the hamiltonian should adjoint operator that the quantization would realization the lya connection with this quantum mechanical problem berry and connes had proposed that the inverse the potential the hamiltonian connected the derivative the function connes approach connes this yields hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are the square the imaginary part the riemann and also the functional determinant this hamiltonian operator just the riemann function fact the riemann function would proportional the functional determinant hadamard proven connes and this approach the analogy with the riemann hypothesis over finite fields suggests that the hilbert space containing eigenvectors corresponding the zeros might some sort first cohomology group the spectrum spec the deninger described some the attempts find such cohomology theory leichtnam zagier constructed natural space invariant functions the upper half plane that has eigenvalues under the laplacian operator that correspond zeros the riemann zeta and remarked that the unlikely event that one could show the existence suitable positive definite inner product this the riemann hypothesis would cartier discussed related where due bizarre bug computer program listed zeros the riemann zeta function eigenvalues the same laplacian schumayer hutchinson surveyed some the attempts construct suitable physical model related the riemann zeta lee yang theorem the lee yang theorem states that the zeros certain partition functions statistical mechanics all lie critical with real part and this has led some speculation about relationship with the riemann hypothesis knauf further explanation needed result showed that the functions have zeros when the real part greater than one then where the liouville function given has prime showed that this turn would imply that the riemann hypothesis however haselgrove proved that negative for infinitely many and also disproved the closely related lya conjecture and borwein ferguson mossinghoff showed that the smallest such spira showed numerical calculation that the finite dirichlet series above for has zero with real part greater than tur also showed that somewhat weaker the nonexistence zeros with real part greater than for large the finite dirichlet series would also imply the riemann but montgomery showed that for all sufficiently large these series have zeros with real part greater than log log log therefore tur result vacuously true and cannot used help prove the riemann noncommutative geometry connes has described relationship between the riemann hypothesis and noncommutative geometry and shows that suitable analog the selberg trace formula for the action the class group the class space would imply the riemann some these ideas are elaborated lapidus hilbert spaces entire functions louis branges showed that the riemann hypothesis would follow from positivity condition certain hilbert space entire functions however conrey showed that the necessary positivity conditions are not quasicrystals the riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros the zeta function form quasicrystal meaning distribution with discrete support whose fourier transform also has discrete dyson suggested trying prove the riemann hypothesis least dimensional arithmetic zeta functions models elliptic curves over number fields when one goes from geometric dimension algebraic number geometric dimension regular model elliptic curve over number the dimensional part the generalized riemann hypothesis for the arithmetic zeta function the model deals with the poles the zeta dimension one the study the zeta integral tate thesis does not lead new important information the riemann contrary dimension two work ivan fesenko dimensional generalisation thesis includes integral representation zeta integral closely related the zeta this new not possible dimension the poles the zeta function can studied via the zeta integral and associated adele related conjecture fesenko the positivity the fourth derivative boundary function associated the zeta integral essentially implies the pole part the generalized riemann suzuki proved that the together with some technical implies multiple zeta functions deligne proof the riemann hypothesis over finite fields used the zeta functions product whose zeros and poles correspond sums zeros and poles the original zeta order bound the real parts the zeros the original zeta kurokawa introduced multiple zeta functions whose zeros and poles correspond sums zeros and poles the riemann zeta make the series converge restricted sums zeros poles all with negative imaginary the known bounds the zeros and poles the multiple zeta functions are not strong enough give useful estimates for the zeros the riemann zeta location the zeros number zeros the functional equation combined with the argument principle implies that the number zeros the zeta function with imaginary part between and given for where the argument defined varying continuously along the line with starting with argument this the sum large but well understood term and small but rather mysterious term the density zeros with imaginary part near about and the function describes the small deviations from the function jumps each zero the zeta and for decreases monotonically between zeros with derivative close log karatsuba proved that every interval for contains least points where the function changes selberg showed that the average moments even powers are given this suggests that log log resembles gaussian random variable with mean and variance ghosh proved this particular usually somewhere around log log but occasionally much the exact order growth not there has been unconditional improvement original bound log though the riemann hypothesis implies the slightly smaller bound log log log titchmarsh the true order magnitude may somewhat less than random functions with the same distribution tend have growth order about the other direction cannot too selberg showed that log log log and assuming the riemann hypothesis montgomery showed that log log log numerical calculations confirm that grows very for for and the largest value found far not much larger than odlyzko riemann estimate log implies that the gaps between zeros are and littlewood improved this showing that the gaps between their imaginary parts tends theorem hadamard and poussin hadamard and poussin independently proved that zeros could lie the line together with the functional equation and the fact that there are zeros with real part greater than this showed that all trivial zeros must lie the interior the critical strip this was key step their first proofs the prime number theorem both the original proofs that the zeta function has zeros with real part are and depend showing that vanishes then which not one way doing this using the inequality for real and looking the limit this inequality follows taking the real part the log the euler product see that where the sum over all prime powers that which least because all the terms the sum are due the inequality free regions poussin proved that zero the riemann zeta then log for some positive constant other words zeros cannot too close the line there free region close this this free region has been enlarged several ford gave version with explicit numerical whenever and zeros the critical line hardy and hardy littlewood showed there are infinitely many zeros the critical considering moments certain functions related the zeta selberg proved that least positive proportion zeros lie the levinson improved this third the zeros relating the zeros the zeta function those its and conrey improved this further most zeros lie close the critical more bohr landau showed that for any positive all but infinitely small proportion zeros lie within distance the critical ivi gives several more precise versions this called zero density estimates which bound the number zeros regions with imaginary part most and real part least hardy littlewood conjectures godfrey harold hardy proved that has infinitely many real let the total number real the total number zeros odd order the function lying the interval the next two conjectures hardy and john edensor littlewood the distance between real zeros and the density zeros intervals for sufficiently large and with less possible value where arbitrarily small open two new directions the investigation the riemann zeta for any there exists such that for and the interval contains zero odd order the function for any there exist and such that for and the inequality selberg conjecture selberg conjecture zeta function conjecture atle selberg investigated the problem littlewood and proved that for any there exists such and such that for and the inequality selberg conjectured that this could tightened karatsuba proved that for fixed satisfying the condition sufficiently large and the interval contains least real zeros the riemann zeta function and therefore confirmed the selberg the estimates selberg and karatsuba can not improved respect the order growth karatsuba proved that analog the selberg conjecture holds for almost all intervals where arbitrarily small fixed positive the karatsuba method permits investigate zeros the riemann function supershort intervals the critical that the intervals the length which grows slower than even arbitrarily small degree proved that for any given numbers satisfying the conditions almost all intervals for contain least zeros the function this estimate quite close the one that follows from the riemann numerical calculations the function has the same zeros the zeta function the critical and real the critical line because the functional one can prove the existence zeros exactly the real line between two points checking numerically that the function has opposite signs these usually one writes where function and the riemann siegel theta function are uniquely defined this and the condition that they are smooth real functions with finding many intervals where the function changes sign one can show that there are many zeros the critical verify the riemann hypothesis given imaginary part the one also has check that there are further zeros off the line this this can done calculating the total number zeros the region and checking that the same the number zeros found the this allows one verify the riemann hypothesis computationally any desired value provided all the zeros the zeta function this region are simple and the critical some calculations zeros the zeta function are listed far all zeros that have been checked are the critical line and are multiple zero would cause problems for the zero finding which depend finding sign changes between for tables the

enclosed two successive gram but zero and two zeros are such interval the long arguments for and against the riemann hypothesis mathematical papers about the riemann hypothesis tend cautiously noncommittal about its authors who express most such riemann bombieri imply that they expect least that the few authors who express serious doubt about include ivi who lists some reasons for being and littlewood who flatly states that believes and that there evidence whatever for and imaginable reason that would the consensus the survey articles bombieri conrey and sarnak that the evidence for strong but not that while probably true there some reasonable doubt about some the arguments for the riemann hypothesis are listed sarnak conrey and ivi and include the following several analogues the riemann hypothesis have already been the proof the riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields deligne possibly the single strongest theoretical reason favor the riemann this provides some evidence for the more general conjecture that all zeta functions associated with automorphic forms satisfy riemann which includes the classical riemann hypothesis special similarly selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue the riemann and are some ways similar the riemann zeta having functional equation and infinite product expansion analogous the euler product however there are also some major for example they are not given dirichlet the riemann hypothesis for the goss zeta function was proved sheats contrast these positive however some epstein zeta functions not satisfy the riemann even though they have infinite number zeros the critical line titchmarsh these functions are quite similar the riemann zeta and have dirichlet series expansion and functional but the ones known fail the riemann hypothesis not have euler product and are not directly related automorphic representations the numerical verification that many zeros lie the line seems strong evidence for however analytic number theory has had many conjectures supported large amounts numerical evidence that turn out see skewes number for notorious where the first exception plausible conjecture related the riemann hypothesis probably occurs around counterexample the riemann hypothesis with imaginary part this size would far beyond anything that can currently computed using direct the problem that the behavior often influenced very slowly increasing functions such log log that tend but slowly that this cannot detected such functions occur the theory the zeta function controlling the behavior its for example the function above has average size around log log jumps least any counterexample the riemann one might expect any counterexamples the riemann hypothesis start appearing only when becomes never much more than far has been but known suggesting that calculations may not have yet reached the region typical behavior the zeta denjoy probabilistic argument for the riemann hypothesis edwards based the observation that random sequence and for every the partial sums simple random walk probability bius function mertens function theorem the calculations odlyzko show that the zeros the zeta function behave very much like the eigenvalues random hermitian suggesting that they are the eigenvalues some adjoint which would imply the riemann however all attempts find such operator have there are several such the weak goldbach conjecture for sufficiently large odd that were first proved using the generalized riemann and later shown true this could considered weak evidence for the generalized riemann several its predictions turned out lehmer phenomenon lehmer where two zeros are sometimes very close sometimes given reason disbelieve the riemann however one would expect this happen occasionally just chance even the riemann hypothesis were and calculations suggest that nearby pairs zeros occur just often predicted montgomery conjecture patterson suggests that the most
