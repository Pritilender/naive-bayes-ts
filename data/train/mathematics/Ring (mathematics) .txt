mathematics	ring navigation search annulus ring sets david hilbert die theorie der algebraischen mathematics and more specifically algebra ring algebraic structure with operations generalizing the arithmetic operations addition and multiplication means this theorems from arithmetic are extended numerical objects like polynomials series matrices and functions rings were first formalized common generalization dedekind domains that occur number theory and polynomial rings and rings invariants that occur algebraic geometry and invariant theory they are also used other branches mathematics such geometry and mathematical analysis the formal definition rings relatively dating from the briefly ring abelian group with second binary operation that distributive over the abelian group operation and the abelian group operation called addition and the second binary operation called multiplication analogy with the integers one familiar example ring the set the integers are commutative ring since times equal times the set polynomials also forms commutative example commutative ring the ring square matrices the same finally field commutative ring which one can divide any nonzero example the field real numbers whether ring commutative not has profound implication the study rings abstract the field called the ring theory the development the commutative commonly known commutative algebra has been greatly influenced problems and ideas occurring naturally algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry important commutative rings include polynomial the coordinate ring affine algebraic variety and the ring integers number the other the noncommutative theory takes examples from representation theory group rings functional analysis operator algebras and the theory differential

also notes citations references general references special references primary sources historical references definition and illustration the most familiar example ring the set all integers consisting the numbers the familiar properties for addition and multiplication integers serve model for the axioms for definition ring set equipped with binary operations and satisfying the following eight called the ring axioms abelian group under meaning associative additive identity additive inverse commutative monoid under meaning multiplicative identity multiplication distributes over notes the definition warning explained the history section below many authors follow alternative convention which ring not required have this article adopts the convention unless otherwise ring assumed have structure satisfying all the axioms except the sixth existence multiplicative identity called rng sometimes pseudo ring for the set even integers with the usual and but not the operations and are called addition and multiplication respectively the multiplication symbol often the mere juxtaposition ring elements interpreted for means although ring addition commutative ring multiplication not required need not necessarily equal rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication such the ring integers are called commutative rings books commutative algebra algebraic geometry often adopt the convention that ring means commutative simplify basic properties some basic properties ring follow immediately from the the additive the additive inverse each and the multiplicative identity are for any element ring one has and ring then has only one and called the zero ring the binomial formula holds for any commuting pair elements any and such that example integers modulo modular arithmetic equip the set with the following the sum the remainder when the integer divided for and the product the remainder when the integer divided for and then each axiom follows from the corresponding axiom for the remainder when divided element and this element often denoted mod which consistent with the notation for the additive inverse any for example matrices matrix ring the set matrices with real number entries written with the operations matrix addition and matrix multiplication this set satisfies the above ring the element the multiplicative identity the and then while this example shows that the ring more for any ring commutative and any nonnegative integer one may form the ring matrices with entries see matrix ring history ring theory history richard dedekind ring theory dedekind the study rings originated from the theory polynomial rings and the theory algebraic integers richard dedekind defined the concept the ring integers number this introduced the terms ideal inspired ernst kummer notion ideal and module and studied their but dedekind did not use the term ring and did not define the concept ring general hilbert the term zahlring number was coined david hilbert and published century the word ring could mean association which still used today english limited sense spy that were the etymology then would similar the way group entered mathematics being technical word for collection related according harvey hilbert used the term for ring that had the property circling directly element specifically ring algebraic all high powers algebraic integer can written integral combination fixed set lower and thus the powers cycle for then and going integral linear combination and fraenkel and noether the first axiomatic definition ring was given adolf fraenkel but his axioms were stricter than those the modern for required every non divisor have multiplicative inverse emmy noether gave the modern axiomatic definition ring and developed the foundations commutative ring theory her monumental paper idealtheorie ringbereichen multiplicative mandatory fraenkel required ring have multiplicative identity whereas noether did most all books algebra around followed convention not requiring starting the became increasingly common see books including the existence the definition especially advanced books notable authors such atiyah and bourbaki eisenbud and but even there remain many books that not require faced with this terminological some authors have tried impose their while others have tried adopt more precise the first find for instance gardner and who argue that one requires all rings have then some consequences include the lack existence infinite direct sums and the fact that proper direct summands rings are not they conclude that maybe branches ring theory the requirement the existence unity element not and therefore the second find authors who use the following rings with multiplicative unital ring unitary ring ring with unity ring with identity ring with rings without multiplicative rng pseudo ring basic examples commutative rings the motivating example the ring integers with the two operations addition and the real and complex numbers form commutative rings they are even fields the gaussian integers form the eisenstein integers does their generalization kummer ring quadratic integers the set all algebraic integers forms this follows for example from the fact that the integral closure the ring rational integers the field complex the rings the previous example are subrings this the polynomial ring polynomials over ring also the set formal power series over commutative ring then the power set becomes ring define addition the symmetric difference sets and multiplication intersection this corresponds ring sets and example boolean ring the set all continuous real valued functions defined the real line forms commutative the operations are addition and multiplication noncommutative rings for any ring and any natural number the set all square matrices with entries from forms ring with matrix addition and matrix multiplication for this matrix ring isomorphic itself for and not the zero this matrix ring abelian group then the endomorphisms form the endomorphism ring end the operations this ring are addition and composition group and the group ring over free module over having multiplication defined the rules that the elements commute with the elements and multiply together they the group many rings that appear analysis are for most banach algebras are non the set natural numbers with the usual operations not since not even group the elements are not all invertible with respect addition for there natural number which can added get there natural way make ring adding negative numbers the thus obtaining the ring integers the natural numbers including form algebraic structure known semiring which has all the properties ring except the additive inverse let the set all continuous functions the real line that vanish outside bounded interval depending the with addition usual but with multiplication defined convolution rng dirac delta function basic concepts elements ring left zero divisor ring element the ring such that there exists nonzero element such that right zero divisor defined nilpotent element element such that for some one example nilpotent element nilpotent matrix nilpotent element nonzero ring necessarily zero idempotent element such that one example idempotent element projection linear unit element having multiplicative inverse this case the inverse and denoted the set units ring group under ring this group denoted for the ring all square matrices size over then consists the set all invertible matrices size and called the general linear group subring subring subset said subring can regarded ring with the addition and the multiplication restricted from equivalently subring not and for any and are all rings have been have multiplicative then subring one would also require share the same identity element all rings have been assumed have multiplicative then proper ideal not for the ring integers subring the field real numbers and also subring the ring polynomials both contains which the multiplicative identity the larger the other the subset even integers does not contain the identity element and thus does not qualify intersection subrings the smallest subring containing given subset called subring generated such subring exists since the intersection all subrings containing for ring the smallest subring containing called the characteristic subring can obtained adding copies and together many times any possible that times can the smallest positive integer such that this then called the characteristic some never zero for any positive integer and those rings are said have characteristic zero given ring let denote the set all elements such that commutes with every element for any then subring called the center more given subset let the set all elements that commute with every element then subring called the centralizer the center the centralizer the entire ring elements subsets the center are said central they generate subring the ideal ideal ring the definition ideal ring analogous that normal subgroup but plays role idealized generalization element hence the name ideal like elements the study ideals central structural understanding let subset then said left ideal here denotes the span over the set finite sums said right ideal subset said two sided ideal simply ideal both left ideal and right sided sided ideal then additive subgroup subset then left called the left ideal generated the smallest left ideal containing similarly the sided ideal generated the smallest sided ideal containing equivalently given right ideals and possible show that the set intersection with ideal the same type and also possible define product ideals such that another ideal the same sidedness and the sum ideals also ideal the same type and then and are left ideals and right respectively they are called the principal left ideals and right ideals generated the principal ideal written for the set all positive and negative multiples along with form ideal the and this ideal generated the integer every ideal the ring integers like ring said simple nonzero and has proper nonzero sided commutative simple ring precisely rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their for ring which there strictly increasing infinite chain left ideals called left noetherian ring ring which there strictly decreasing infinite chain left ideals called left artinian ring somewhat surprising fact that left artinian ring left noetherian the hopkins levitzki theorem the however form noetherian ring which not for commutative the ideals generalize the classical notion divisibility and decomposition integer into prime numbers proper ideal called prime ideal for any elements have that implies either equivalently prime for any ideals have that implies either this latter formulation illustrates the idea ideals generalizations homomorphism ring homomorphism homomorphism from ring ring function from that preserves the ring namely such for all the following identities one working with not necessarily unital then the third condition ring homomorphism said isomorphism there exists inverse homomorphism ring homomorphism which inverse function any bijective ring homomorphism ring two rings are said isomorphic there isomorphism between them and that case one writes ring homomorphism between the same ring called endomorphism and isomorphism between the same ring examples the function that maps each integer its remainder modulo number homomorphism from the ring the quotient ring quotient defined unit element ring then ring called inner automorphism let commutative ring prime characteristic then ring endmorphism called the frobenius homomorphism the galois group field extension the set all automorphisms whose restrictions are the for any ring there are unique ring homomorphism and unique ring homomorphism epimorphism right cancelable rings need not for the unique map algebra homomorphism from algebra the endomorphism algebra vector space over called representation the algebra given ring homomorphism the set all elements mapped called the kernel the kernel sided ideal the image the other not always but always subring give ring homomorphism from commutative ring ring with image contained the center the same give structure algebra over particular gives structure quotient ring quotient ring the quotient ring analogous the notion quotient group more given ring and two sided ideal the quotient ring factor ring the set cosets with respect the additive group cosets with respect together with the for every like the case quotient there canonical map given surjective and satisfies the universal ring homomorphism such that then there unique such that taking the one sees that the quotient ring isomorphic the image the fact known the first isomorphism theorem the last fact implies that actually any surjective ring homomorphism satisfies the universal property since the image such map quotient subset and the quotient are related the following subset called system representatives two elements the set belong the same each element the set represents unique said complete the restriction constructions direct product direct product rings let and then the product can equipped with the following natural ring for every and the ring with the above operations addition and multiplication and the multiplicative identity called the direct product with the same construction also works for arbitrary family are rings indexed set then ring with componentwise addition and let commutative ring and ideals such that whenever then the chinese remainder theorem says that finite direct product may also viewed direct sum namely let the inclusions with the images particular are rings though not then are ideals and direct sum abelian groups because for abelian groups finite products are the same direct clearly the direct sum such ideals also defines product rings that isomorphic equivalently the above can done through central idempotents assume has the above then can write the conditions one has that are central idempotents and again one can reverse the namely one given partition orthogonal central then let which are sided each not sum orthogonal central then their direct sum isomorphic important application infinite direct product the construction projective limit which carries over verbatim from that for namely suppose given family rings running over positive say and ring homomorphisms such that are all the identities and whenever then the subring consisting such that maps under the notion subdirect product rings generalizes direct product polynomial ring polynomial ring given symbol called and commutative ring the set polynomials forms commutative ring with the usual addition and containing called the polynomial ring over more the set all polynomials variables forms commutative containing integral then also integral its field fractions the field rational functions noetherian then noetherian unique factorization then unique factorization finally field and only principal ideal let commutative given element one can consider the ring homomorphism the substitution and then because the polynomial often also denoted the image the map denoted the same thing the subring generated and the substitution special case the universal property polynomial the property given ring homomorphism and element there exists unique ring homomorphism such that and restricts monic polynomial generates the kernel called the minimal polynomial over theoretic the universal property says that free module over with generators give let the ring all functions from the addition and the multiplication are those let the identity each defines constant giving rise the homomorphism the universal property says that this map extends uniquely maps where the polynomial function defined the resulting map injective and only given constant monic polynomial there exists ring containing such that product linear factors let algebraically closed the hilbert nullstellensatz theorem states that there natural one correspondence between the set all prime ideals and the set closed subvarieties many local problems algebraic geometry may attacked through the study the generators ideal polynomial bner basis quotient ring the polynomial ring said finitely generated algebra over finite type over the noether normalization lemma says that any finitely generated commutative algebra contains the polynomial ring with the coefficients over which finitely generated polynomial ring relatively understood and thus the theorem allows one study ring from the known facts about polynomial there are some other related formal power series ring consists formal power series together with multiplication and addition that mimic those for convergent contains the important advantage formal power series ring that local complete one can also consider polynomial ring infinitely many variables union direct over all this ring often used furnish finally there closely related ring polynomial functions vector space vector space over infinite then choosing may identified with polynomial matrix ring and endomorphism ring matrix ring endomorphism ring let ring not necessarily the set all square matrices size with entries forms ring with the wise addition and the usual matrix multiplication called the matrix ring and denoted given right module the set all linear maps from itself forms ring with addition that function and multiplication that composition functions called the endomorphism ring and denoted linear matrix ring may canonically interpreted endomorphism this special case the following linear then may written matrix with entries resulting homomorphism which clearly let matrix whose entry and the other entries the centralizer then any ring homomorhism induces any ring homomorphism between matrix rings arises this schur lemma says that simple right then division let direct sum modules where are simple modules and means direct sum copies then the artin wedderburn theorem states any semisimple ring below this ring and the matrix ring over are morita equivalent the category right modules equivalent the category right modules over two sided ideals correspond one sided ideals examples the automorphisms the projective line over ring are given homographies from the matrix the following construction useful for application linear algebra see also another example the domain section let left given and linear then and generate commutative subring the universal property polynomial uniquely extends acquires structure module over let denote the resulting this allows one study terms the for assuming diagonalizable linear transformation and only semisimple for another are isomorphic module and only are for some isomorphism localization the localization generalizes the construction the field fractions integral domain arbitrary ring and given not necessarily ring and subset there exists ring together with the ring homomorphism that inverts that the homomorphism maps elements the unit elements and moreover any ring homomorphism from that inverts uniquely factors through the ring called the localization with respect for commutative ring and element then the localization consists elements the form the localization frequently applied commutative ring with respect the complement prime ideal union prime that case one often writes for then local ring with the maximal ideal this the reason for the terminology localization the field fractions integral domain the localization the prime ideal prime ideal commutative ring then the field fractions the same the residue field the local ring and denoted left then the localization with respect given change rings the most important properties localization are the when commutative ring and multiplicatively closed subset bijection between the set all prime ideals disjoint from and the set all prime ideals running over elements with partial ordering given the localization exact for any maximal ideal then localization help proving global one instance this that two modules are isomorphic all prime does not follow that they are one way explain this that the localization allows one view module sheaf over prime ideals and sheaf inherently local category localization category amounts making some morphisms element commutative ring may thought endomorphism any thus categorically localization with respect subset functor from the category modules itself that sends elements viewed endomorphisms automorphisms and universal with respect this then maps and modules map completion let commutative and let ideal the completion the projective limit commutative the canonical homomorphisms from the quotients induce homomorphism the latter homomorphism injective noetherian integral domain and proper noetherian local ring with maximal ideal krull intersection theorem the construction especially useful when maximal the basic example the completion the principal ideal generated prime number called the ring adic integers the completion can this case constructed also from the adic absolute value the adic absolute value map from given where denotes the exponent the prime factorization nonzero integer into prime numbers also put and defines distance function and the completion metric space denoted again field since the field operations extend the the subring consisting elements with isomorphic similarly the formal power series ring the completion see hensel lemma complete ring has much simpler structure than commutative this owns the cohen structure theorem which roughly that complete local ring tends look like formal power series ring quotient the other the interaction between the integral closure and completion has been among the most important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed the likes pathological examples found nagata led the reexamination the roles noetherian rings and among other the definition excellent ring group ring group ring this construction allows one study group using the ring let group and commutative the group ring over then the set all functions such that for all but finitely many with addition and multiplication defined let and make abelian group with the ordinary addition the multiplication given convolution this finite sum and therefore also the function belongs one then checks that the addition and the multiplication satisfy the ring has the multiplicative identity where for all kronecker delta form basis explicitly for any there the expansion essentially the same construction possible for unital semigroup instead group except the multiplication given the resulting ring called semigroup ring for polynomial ring one variable over tensor product tensor product algebras change rings let algebras over commutative ring then the tensor product modules can turn ring extending linearly for then and for algebras over and their subalgebras resp where refers the centralizer the center the tensor product the centers and given ring homomorphism with central the functor the left adjoint the forgetful functor from the category algebra over the category algebras over rings with generators and relations the most general way construct ring specifying generators and let free ring free algebra over the with the set consists polynomials with integral coefficients noncommuting variables that are elements free ring satisfies the universal any function from the set ring factors through that the unique ring just the group every ring can represented quotient free now can impose relations among symbols taking explicitly subset then the quotient ring the ideal generated called the ring with generators and relations used say base ring instead then the resulting ring will over for then the resulting ring will the usual polynomial ring with coefficients variables that are elements also the same thing the symmetric algebra over with symbols the theoretic the formation the left adjoint functor the forgetful functor from the category rings set and often called the free ring special kinds rings domains nonzero ring with nonzero zero divisors called domain commutative domain called integral domain the most important integral domains are principal ideals pid for and principal ideal domain integral domain which every ideal important class integral domains that contain pid unique factorization domain integral domain which every nonunit element product prime element prime prime the fundamental question algebraic number theory the extent which the ring integers not necessarily rational fails among theorems concerning the most important one the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domain the theorem may illustrated the following application linear let dimensional vector space over field and linear map with minimal polynomial then since unique factorization factors into powers distinct irreducible polynomials prime letting make the structure theorem then says that module where each isomorphic direct sum submodules isomorphic now then such has basis which the restriction represented jordan matrix thus say algebraically then are the form and the above decomposition corresponds the jordan canonical form any nonzero subring field necessarily integral the converse also integral domain always subring its field fractions this only partially generalizes noncommutative algebraic ufd arise because more point variety over perfect smooth the local ring the point regular local ring regular local ring the following chain class inclusions that describes the relationship between domains and commutative rings integral domains integrally closed domains unique factorization domains principal ideal domains euclidean domains fields division ring division ring ring such that every zero element commutative division ring field prominent example division ring that not field the ring quaternions any centralizer division ring also division the center division ring turned out that every finite domain particular finite division particular commutative the wedderburn little theorem every module over division ring free module has consequently much linear algebra can carried out over division ring instead the study conjugacy classes figures prominently the classical theory division cartan famously asked the following given division ring and proper ring that not contained the does each inner automorphism restrict automorphism the answer this the cartan hua theorem cyclic algebra introduced dickson generalization quaternion algebra semisimple rings ring called semisimple ring semisimple left module right over direct sum simple ring called semiprimitive ring its jacobson radical the jacobson radical the intersection all maximal left ring semisimple and only artinian and algebra over field artinian and only has finite thus semisimple algebra over field necessarily while simple algebra may have the ring differential operators any module over semisimple ring any free module over semisimple ring clearly semisimple and any module quotient free examples semisimple matrix ring over division ring semisimple actually the group ring finite group over field semisimple the characteristic does not divide the order maschke theorem the weyl algebra over simple not semisimple since has infinite dimension and thus not clifford algebras are semisimplicity closely related algebra over field said separable the base extension semisimple for any field extension happens then this equivalent the usual definition field theory separable extension central simple algebra and brauer group central simple algebra for field algebra central its center and simple simple ring since the center simple algebra any simple algebra central simple algebra over its this central simple algebra assumed have finite also mostly fix the base thus algebra refers the matrix ring size over ring will denoted the skolem noether theorem states any automorphism central simple algebra two central simple algebras and are said similar there are integers and such that since the similarity equivalence the similarity classes with the multiplication form abelian group called the brauer group and denoted the artin wedderburn theorem central simple algebra the matrix ring division thus each similarity class represented unique division for trivial finite field algebraically closed field more generally quasi algebraically closed field tsen theorem has order special case the theorem frobenius finally nonarchimedean local field then through the invariant map now field extension then the base extension induces its kernel denoted consists such that matrix ring over split the extension finite and then canonically isomorphic azumaya algebras generalize the notion central simple algebras commutative local rings with extra structure ring may viewed abelian group using the addition with extra the same there are other mathematical objects which may considered rings with extra for associative algebra ring that also vector space over field for the set matrices over the real field has dimension real vector ring topological ring its set elements given topology which makes the addition map and the multiplication map both continuous maps between topological spaces where inherits the product topology any other product the for matrices over the real numbers could given either the euclidean topology the zariski topology and either case one would obtain topological some examples the ubiquity rings many different kinds mathematical objects can fruitfully analyzed terms some associated ring cohomology ring topological space any topological space one can associate its integral cohomology ring graded ring there are also homology groups and indeed these were defined useful tool for distinguishing between certain pairs topological like the spheres and tori for which the methods point set topology are not cohomology groups were later defined terms homology groups way which roughly analogous the dual vector space know each individual integral homology group essentially the same knowing each individual integral cohomology because the universal coefficient theorem however the advantage the cohomology groups that there natural product which analogous the observation that one can multiply pointwise multilinear form and multilinear form get multilinear the ring structure cohomology provides the foundation for characteristic classes fiber bundles intersection theory manifolds and algebraic varieties schubert calculus and much burnside ring group any group associated its burnside ring which uses ring describe the various ways the group can act finite the burnside additive group the free abelian group whose basis are the transitive actions the group and whose addition the disjoint union the expressing action terms the basis decomposing action into its transitive the multiplication easily expressed terms the representation ring the multiplication the burnside ring formed writing the tensor product two permutation modules permutation

category under the tensor product modules the monoid action ring abelian group simply module essentially module generalization the notion vector space where rather than vector space over one has vector space over let abelian group and let its endomorphism ring see note essentially end the set all morphisms where and the following rules may used compute and where addition and function composition denoted from right therefore associated any abelian conversely given any abelian furthermore for every right multiplication gives rise morphism right distributivity let consider those endomorphisms that factor right multiplication other let end the set all morphisms having the property that was seen that every gives rise morphism right multiplication fact true that this association any element morphism function from end isomorphism this therefore any ring can viewed the endomorphism ring some abelian group meant group with being its set operators the most general form the endomorphism group some abelian any ring can seen preadditive category with single therefore natural consider arbitrary preadditive categories generalizations and many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can translated this more general additive functors between preadditive categories generalize the concept ring and ideals additive categories can defined sets morphisms closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary generalization algebraists have defined structures more general than rings weakening dropping some ring rng rng the same except that the existence multiplicative identity not nonassociative ring nonassociative ring algebraic structure that satisfies all the ring axioms but the associativity and the existence multiplicative identity notable example lie algebra there exists some structure theory for such algebras that generalizes the analogous results for lie algebras and associative citation needed semiring semiring obtained
