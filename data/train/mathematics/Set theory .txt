mathematics	set theory navigation search set theory venn diagram intersection sets set theory the branch mathematical logic that studies sets which are collections although any type object can collected into set theory applied most often objects that are relevant the language set theory can used the definitions nearly all mathematical objects the modern study set theory was initiated georg cantor and richard dedekind the after the discovery paradoxes naive set theory numerous axiom systems were proposed the early twentieth which the zermelo fraenkel axioms with the axiom choice are the set theory commonly employed foundational system for mathematics particularly the form zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom choice beyond its foundational set theory branch mathematics its own with active research contemporary research into set theory includes diverse collection ranging from the structure the real number line the study the consistency large cardinals contents history basic concepts and notation some ontology axiomatic set theory applications areas study combinatorial set theory descriptive set theory fuzzy set theory inner model theory large cardinals determinacy forcing cardinal invariants set theoretic topology objections set theory foundation for mathematics see also notes further reading external links history mathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many set however was founded single paper georg cantor characteristic property all real algebraic since the century beginning with greek mathematician zeno elea the west and early indian mathematicians the mathematicians had struggled with the concept infinity especially notable the work bernard bolzano the first half the modern understanding infinity began with work number meeting between cantor and richard dedekind influenced thinking and culminated paper cantor work initially polarized the mathematicians his while karl weierstrass and dedekind supported leopold kronecker now seen founder mathematical constructivism did cantorian set theory eventually became due the utility cantorian such one one correspondence among his proof that there are more real numbers than and the infinity cantor paradise resulting from the power set operation this utility set theory led the article mengenlehre contributed arthur schoenflies klein encyclopedia the next wave excitement set theory came around when was discovered that cantorian set theory gave rise several called antinomies paradoxes bertrand russell and ernst zermelo independently found the simplest and best known now called russell paradox consider the set all sets that are not members which leads contradiction since must member and not member cantor had himself posed the question what the cardinal number the set all and obtained related russell used his paradox theme his review continental mathematics his the principles mathematics the momentum set theory was such that debate the paradoxes did not lead its the work zermelo and abraham fraenkel resulted the set axioms zfc which became the most commonly used set axioms for set the work analysts such henri lebesgue demonstrated the great mathematical utility set which has since become woven into the fabric modern set theory commonly used foundational although some areas category theory thought preferred basic concepts and notation set algebra sets set theory begins with fundamental binary relation between object and set member element write since sets are the membership relation can relate sets derived binary relation between two sets the subset also called set inclusion all the members set are also members set then subset denoted for subset but from this clear that set subset for cases where one wishes rule this the term proper subset called proper subset and only subset but not subset just arithmetic features binary operations numbers set theory features binary operations the union the sets and denoted the set all objects that are member the union and the set intersection the sets and denoted the set all objects that are members both and the intersection and the set set difference and denoted the set all members that are not members the set difference while conversely the set difference when subset the set difference also called the complement this the choice clear from the the notation sometimes used instead particularly universal set the study venn diagrams symmetric difference sets and denoted the set all objects that are member exactly one and elements which are one the but not for for the sets and the symmetric difference set the set difference the union and the cartesian product and denoted the set whose members are all possible ordered pairs where member and member the cartesian product and white red white red white power set set the set whose members are all possible subsets for the power set some basic sets central importance are the empty set the unique set containing the set natural numbers and the set real numbers some ontology von neumann universe set pure all its members are all members its members are and for the set containing only the empty set nonempty pure modern set common restrict attention the von neumann universe pure and many systems axiomatic set theory are designed axiomatize the pure sets there are many technical advantages this and little generality because essentially all mathematical concepts can modeled pure sets the von neumann universe are organized into cumulative hierarchy based how deeply their members etc are each set this hierarchy assigned transfinite recursion ordinal number known its rank the rank pure set defined the least upper bound all successors ranks members for the empty set assigned rank while the set containing only the empty set assigned rank for each ordinal the set defined consist all pure sets with rank less than the entire von neumann universe axiomatic set theory elementary set theory can studied informally and and can taught primary schools using venn diagrams the intuitive approach tacitly assumes that set may formed from the class all objects satisfying any particular defining this assumption gives rise the simplest and best known which are russell paradox and the burali forti paradox axiomatic set theory was originally devised rid set theory such the most widely studied systems axiomatic set theory imply that all sets form cumulative hierarchy such systems come two those whose ontology consists sets alone this includes the most common axiomatic set zermelo fraenkel set theory which includes the axiom choice fragments zfc zermelo set theory which replaces the axiom schema replacement with that separation general set theory small fragment zermelo set theory sufficient for the peano axioms and finite sets kripke platek set theory which omits the axioms powerset and choice and weakens the axiom schemata separation and replacement sets and proper classes these include von del set theory which has the same strength zfc for theorems about sets and morse kelley set theory and tarski grothendieck set theory both which are stronger than the above systems can modified allow urelements objects that can members sets but that are not themselves sets and not have any the systems new foundations nfu allowing urelements and lacking are not based cumulative and nfu include set relative which every set has these systems urelements because but not produces sets for which the axiom choice does not systems constructive set theory such czf and embed their set axioms intuitionistic logic instead first order logic yet other systems accept standard first order logic but feature nonstandard membership these include rough set theory and fuzzy set theory which the value atomic formula embodying the membership relation not simply true false the boolean valued models zfc are related enrichment zfc called internal set theory was proposed edward nelson applications many mathematical concepts can defined precisely using only set theoretic for mathematical structures diverse graphs manifolds rings and vector spaces can all defined sets satisfying various properties equivalence and order relations are ubiquitous and the theory mathematical relations can described set set theory also promising foundational system for much since the publication the first volume principia mathematica has been claimed that most even all mathematical theorems can derived using aptly designed set axioms for set augmented with many using first second order logic for properties the natural and real numbers can derived within set each number system can identified with set equivalence classes under suitable equivalence relation whose field some infinite set set theory foundation for mathematical analysis topology abstract algebra and discrete mathematics likewise mathematicians accept that theorems these areas can derived from the relevant definitions and the axioms set few full derivations complex mathematical theorems from set theory have been formally however because such formal derivations are often much longer than the natural language proofs mathematicians commonly one verification metamath includes derivations more than theorems starting from the zfc axioms and using first order logic areas study set theory major area research with many interrelated combinatorial set theory infinitary combinatorics combinatorial set theory concerns extensions finite combinatorics infinite this includes the study cardinal arithmetic and the study extensions ramsey theorem such the erd rado theorem descriptive set theory descriptive set theory descriptive set theory the study subsets the real line and more subsets polish spaces begins with the study pointclasses the borel hierarchy and extends the study more complex hierarchies such the projective hierarchy and the wadge hierarchy many properties borel sets can established but proving these properties hold for more complicated sets requires additional axioms related determinacy and large the field effective descriptive set theory between set theory and recursion theory includes the study lightface pointclasses and closely related hyperarithmetical theory many results classical descriptive set theory have effective some new results are obtained proving the effective version first and then extending relativizing make more broadly recent area research concerns borel equivalence relations and more complicated definable equivalence relations this has important applications the study invariants many fields fuzzy set theory fuzzy set theory set theory cantor defined and zermelo and fraenkel axiomatized object either member set fuzzy set theory this condition was relaxed lotfi zadeh object has degree membership number between and for the degree membership person the set tall more flexible than simple yes answer and can real number such inner model theory inner model theory inner model fraenkel set theory transitive class that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms the canonical example the constructible universe developed one reason that the study inner models interest that can used prove consistency for can shown that regardless whether model satisfies the continuum hypothesis the axiom choice the inner model constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom thus the assumption that consistent has least one implies that together with these two principles the study inner models common the study determinacy and large cardinals especially when considering axioms such the axiom determinacy that contradict the axiom even fixed model set theory satisfies the axiom possible for inner model fail satisfy the axiom for the existence sufficiently large cardinals implies that there inner model satisfying the axiom determinacy and thus not satisfying the axiom large cardinals large cardinal property large cardinal cardinal number with extra many such properties are including inaccessible cardinals measurable cardinals and many these properties typically imply the cardinal number must very with the existence cardinal with the specified property unprovable fraenkel set determinacy determinacy determinacy refers the fact under appropriate certain player games perfect information are determined from the start the sense that one player must have winning the existence these strategies has important consequences descriptive set the assumption that broader class games determined often implies that broader class sets will have topological the axiom determinacy important object although incompatible with the axiom implies that all subsets the real line are well behaved measurable and with the perfect set can used prove that the wadge degrees have elegant forcing forcing paul cohen invented the method forcing while searching for model zfc which the axiom choice the continuum hypothesis fails forcing adjoins some given model set theory additional sets order create larger model with properties determined forced the construction and the original for cohen construction adjoins additional subsets the natural numbers without changing any the cardinal numbers the original forcing also one two methods for proving relative consistency finitistic the other method being boolean valued models cardinal invariants cardinal invariant cardinal invariant property the real line measured cardinal for studied invariant the smallest cardinality collection meagre sets reals whose union the entire real these are invariants the sense that any two isomorphic models set theory must give the same cardinal for each many cardinal invariants have been and the relationships between them are often complex and related axioms set set theoretic topology set theoretic topology theoretic topology studies questions general topology that are theoretic nature that require advanced methods set theory for their many these theorems are independent requiring stronger axioms for their famous problem the normal moore space question question general topology that was the subject intense the answer the normal moore space question was eventually proved independent objections set theory foundation for mathematics from set some mathematicians have objected foundation for mathematics the most common objection set one kronecker voiced set earliest starts from the constructivist view that mathematics loosely related this view then the treatment infinite both naive and axiomatic set introduces into mathematics methods and objects that are not computable even ludwig wittgenstein condemned set wrote that set theory since builds the nonsense fictitious has pernicious and that nonsensical talk about all wittgenstein views about the foundations mathematics were later criticised georg kreisel and paul bernays and investigated crispin wright among category theorists have proposed topos theory alternative traditional axiomatic set topos theory can interpret various alternatives that such constructivism finite set and computable set topoi also give natural setting for forcing and discussions the independence choice from well providing the framework for pointless topology and stone spaces active area research the univalent foundations arising from homotopy type
