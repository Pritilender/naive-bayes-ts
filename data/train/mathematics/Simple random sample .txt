may challenged and november statistics simple random sample subset individuals sample chosen from larger set population each individual chosen randomly and entirely such that each individual has the same probability being chosen any stage during the sampling and each subset individuals has the same probability being chosen for the sample any other subset individuals this process and technique known simple random sampling and should not confused with systematic random sampling simple random sample unbiased surveying simple random sampling basic type since can component other more complex sampling the principle simple random sampling that every object has the same probability being for suppose college students want get ticket for basketball but there are only tickets for they decide have fair way see who gets then everybody given number the range from and random numbers are either electronically from table random numbers outside the range from are are any numbers previously the first numbers would identify the lucky ticket small populations and often large such sampling typically done without replacement one deliberately avoids choosing any member the population more than although simple random sampling can conducted with replacement this less common and would normally described more fully simple random sampling with replacement sampling done without replacement longer but still satisfies exchangeability hence many results still further for small sample from large sampling without replacement approximately the same sampling with since the odds choosing the same individual twice unbiased random selection individuals important that large number samples were the average sample would accurately represent the however this does not guarantee that particular sample perfect representation the simple random sampling merely allows one draw externally valid conclusions about the entire population based the conceptually simple random sampling the simplest the probability sampling requires complete sampling which may not available feasible construct for large even complete frame more efficient approaches may possible other useful information available about the units the advantages are that free classification and requires minimum advance knowledge the population other than the its simplicity also makes relatively easy interpret data collected this for these simple random sampling best suits situations where not much information available about the population and data collection can efficiently conducted randomly distributed where the cost sampling small enough make efficiency less important than these conditions not stratified sampling cluster sampling may better contents distinction between systematic random sample and simple random sample sampling dichotomous population see also references distinction between systematic random sample and simple random sample consider school with students divided equally into boys and and suppose that researcher wants select them for further all their names might put bucket and then names might pulled not only does each person have equal chance being can also easily calculate the probability given person being since know the sample size and the population the case that any given person can only selected once after selection person removed from the selection the case that any selected person returned the selection pool can picked more than this means that every student the school has any case approximately chance being selected using this further all combinations students have the same probability systematic pattern introduced into random referred systematic sampling example would the students the school had numbers attached their names ranging from and chose random starting and then picked every name thereafter give our sample starting over with after reaching this this technique similar cluster since the choice the first unit will determine the this longer simple random because some combinations students have larger selection probability than others for has chance while cannot selected under this sampling dichotomous population the members the population come two say red and black the number red elements sample given size will vary sample and hence random variable whose distribution can that distribution depends the numbers red and black elements the full for simple random sample with replacement the distribution binomial distribution for simple random sample without replacement one obtains hypergeometric distribution see also sampling probability size
