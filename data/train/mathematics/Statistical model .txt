statistical model navigation search statistical model formalization relationships between variables the form mathematical statistical model describes how one more random variables are related one more other the model statistical the variables are not deterministically but stochastically related mathematical statistical model frequently thought pair where the set possible observations and the set possible probability distributions assumed that there distinct element which generates the observed statistical inference enables make statements about which this set are likely the true most statistical tests can described the form statistical for the student test for comparing the means two groups can formulated seeing estimated parameter the model different from another similarity between tests and models that there are assumptions error assumed normally distributed most contents formal definition model comparison example classification see also references formal definition statistical model collection probability distribution functions probability density functions collectively referred distributions for parametric model collection each which indexed unique dimensional where parameter and the feasible region which subset dimensional euclidean space statistical model may used describe the set distributions from which one assumes that particular data set for one assumes that data arise from univariate gaussian distribution then one has assumed gaussian model non parametric model set probability distributions with infinite dimensional and might written semi parametric model also has infinite dimensional but not dense the space for mixture gaussians with one gaussian each data point dense the space formally the dimension the and the number and then the model model comparison models can compared each this can either done when you have done exploratory data analysis confirmatory data analysis exploratory you formulate all models you can think and see which describes your data confirmatory analysis you test which your models you have described before the data was collected fits the data test your only model fits the linear regression analysis you can compare the amount variance explained the independent across the different you can compare models that are nested using likelihood ratio test nested models are models that can obtained restricting parameter more complex model example height and age are probabilistically distributed over they are stochastically when you know that person age this influences the chance this person being feet you could formalize this relationship linear regression model the following height age where the parameter that age multiplied get prediction the error and the this means that height starts some there minimum height when someone and predicted age some this prediction not perfect error included the this error contains variance that stems from sex and other when sex included the the error term will become you will have better idea the chance that particular old feet tall when you know this old the model would become height age sex where the variable sex dichotomous this model would presumably have higher the first model nested the second the first model obtained from the second when restricted classification according the number the endogenous variables and the number models can classified complete models the number equations equal the number endogenous and incomplete some other statistical models are the general linear model restricted continuous dependent the generalized linear model for logistic regression the multilevel model and the structural equation model see also statistical model testing econometric model mathematical diagram regression analysis this article includes list references but its sources remain unclear because has insufficient inline citations please help improve this article introducing more precise september
