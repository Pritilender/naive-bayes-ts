mathematics	subtraction navigation search subtraction mathematical operation that represents the operation removing objects from signified the minus sign for the picture the there are apples meaning apples with taken which total apples therefore besides counting subtraction can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds negative numbers fractions irrational numbers vectors decimals functions matrices and subtraction follows several important anticommutative meaning that changing the order changes the sign the not associative meaning that when one subtracts more than two the order which subtraction performed subtraction does not change subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such addition and multiplication all these rules can proven starting with the subtraction integers and generalizing through the real numbers and general binary operations that continue these patterns are studied abstract algebra performing subtraction one the simplest numerical subtraction very small numbers accessible young primary education students are taught subtract numbers the decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus the modern computer contents basic integers subtraction addition algorithms for subtraction the teaching subtraction schools subtraction hand austrian method subtraction from left right american method trade first partial differences nonvertical methods counting breaking the subtraction same change units measurement see also references bibliography external links basic integers imagine line segment length with the left end labeled and the right end labeled starting from takes steps the right reach this movement the right modeled mathematically addition from takes steps the left get back this movement the left modeled line segment labeled with the numbers and from position takes steps the left stay takes steps the left get position this picture inadequate describe what would happen after going steps the left position represent such the line must subtract arbitrary natural numbers one begins with line containing every natural number from takes steps the left get but still invalid since again leaves the the natural numbers are not useful context for the solution consider the integer number line from takes steps the left get subtraction addition addition sum multiplication product division quotient modulation remainder exponentiation base root radicand logarithm base there are some cases where subtraction separate operation becomes for subtract from not immediately obvious from either natural number view number line because not immediately clear what means move steps the left take away apples one solution view subtraction addition signed extra minus signs simply denote additive inversion then have this also helps keep the ring integers simple avoiding the introduction new operators such ordinarily ring only has two operations defined the case the these are addition and ring already has the concept additive but does not have any notion separate subtraction the use signed addition subtraction allows apply the ring axioms subtraction without needing prove algorithms for subtraction there are various algorithms for and they differ their suitability for various number methods are adapted hand calculation for when making actual subtraction but rather the maker counts for machine the method complements whereby the subtraction replaced addition modular the teaching subtraction schools this section may confusing unclear readers december methods used teach subtraction elementary school vary from country and within different methods are fashion different what the called traditional mathematics specific process taught students the end the year during the year for use with digit whole and extended either the fourth fifth grade include decimal representations fractional some american schools currently teach method subtraction using borrowing regrouping and system markings called although method borrowing had been known and published textbooks the use crutches american schools spread after william brownell published study claiming that crutches were beneficial students using this this system caught displacing the other methods subtraction use america that some european schools employ method subtraction called the austrian also known the additions there borrowing this there are also crutches markings aid which vary both these methods break the subtraction process one digit subtractions place starting with least significant subtraction from minuend where each and proceeds writing down and long does not exceed otherwise increased and some other digit modified correct for this the american method corrects attempting decrease the minuend digit one continuing the borrow leftwards until there zero digit from which the european method corrects increasing the subtrahend digit example the minuend the subtrahend the minuend digits are and the subtrahend digits are and beginning the not less than the difference written down the one the less than the increased and the difference with which written down the the american method corrects for the increase ten reducing the digit the hundreds place that the struck through and replaced the subtraction then proceeds the hundreds where not less than the difference written down the are now the result the austrian method does not reduce the rather increases the subtrahend digit small mark made near below this digit depending the then the subtraction proceeds asking what number when increased and added makes the answer and written down the there additional subtlety that the student always employs mental subtraction table the american the austrian method often encourages the student mentally use the addition table the example rather than adding getting and subtracting that from the student asked consider what when increased and added makes subtraction hand austrian method example the difference written under the the required sum too add and put under the next higher place the now can find the difference like the difference written under the the total subtraction from left right example this result only penciled because the next digit the minuend smaller than the subtract one from our number and mentally add ten the because the next digit the minuend not smaller than the keep this american method this each digit the subtrahend subtracted from the digit above starting from right the top number too small subtract the bottom number from add this from the top digit the which subtract from then move subtracting the next digit and borrowing until every digit has been example write the difference under the the minuend too add the from the digit the which goes down now the subtraction and write the difference under the write the difference under the the total trade first variant the american method where all borrowing done before all example not add the because the from the nearby the lowered not proceed step working from right partial differences the partial differences method different from other vertical subtraction methods because borrowing carrying takes their one places plus minus signs depending whether the minuend greater smaller than the the sum the partial differences the total example the smaller number subtracted from the because the minuend greater than the this difference has plus the smaller number subtracted from the because the minuend smaller than the this difference has minus the smaller number subtracted from the because the minuend greater than the this difference has plus nonvertical methods counting instead finding the difference digit one can count the numbers between the subtrahend and the example can found the following add the value from each step get the total breaking the subtraction another method that useful for mental arithmetic split the subtraction into small example can solved the following same change the same change method uses the fact that adding subtracting the same number from the minuend and subtrahend does not change the one adds the amount needed get zeros the example can solved units measurement when subtracting two numbers with units measurement such kilograms they must have the same most cases the difference will have the same unit the original one exception when subtracting two numbers with percentage this the difference will have percentage points the difference that percentages must while percentage points may see also decrement elementary arithmetic method complements negative number
