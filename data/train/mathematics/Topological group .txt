such that the binary operation and the inverse function are continuous functions with respect the topological group mathematical object with both algebraic structure and topological thus one may perform algebraic because the group and one may talk about continuous because the topological along with continuous group actions are used study continuous symmetries which have many for example physics contents formal definition homomorphisms examples properties relationship other areas mathematics generalizations see also notes references formal definition topological group topological space and group such that the group operations and taking are continuous functions here viewed topological space using the product topology although not part this many authors require that the topology hausdorff this corresponds the identity map being closed inclusion hence also cofibration the and some equivalent are discussed the this not serious any topological group can made hausdorff canonical the language category theory topological groups can defined concisely group objects the category topological spaces the same way that ordinary groups are group objects the category sets note that the axioms are given terms the maps binary unary and nullary hence are categorical adding the further requirement hausdorff and corresponds refining model category homomorphisms homomorphism between two topological groups and just continuous group homomorphism isomorphism topological groups group isomorphism which also homeomorphism the underlying topological this stronger than simply requiring continuous group the inverse must also there are examples topological groups which are isomorphic ordinary groups but not topological indeed any nondiscrete topological group also topological group when considered with the discrete the underlying groups are the but topological groups there not topological together with their form category examples every group can trivially made into topological group considering with the discrete topology such groups are called discrete groups this the theory topological groups subsumes that ordinary the real numbers together with addition operation and its usual form topological more euclidean space with addition and standard topology topological more generally the additive groups all topological vector spaces such banach spaces hilbert spaces are topological the above examples are all abelian examples abelian topological groups are given the classical groups for the general linear group all invertible matrices with real entries can viewed topological group with the topology defined viewing subset euclidean space example topological group which not lie group given the rational numbers with the topology inherited from this countable space and does not have the discrete topology for nonabelian consider the subgroup rotations generated two rotations irrational multiples about different every banach algebra with multiplicative the set invertible elements forms topological group under properties the algebraic and topological structures topological group interact trivial for any topological group the identity component the connected component containing the identity closed normal subgroup this because the identity the component the containing the collection all left cosets right equal the collection all components therefore the quotient topology induced the quotient map from totally disconnected the inversion operation topological group homeomorphism from likewise any element then left right multiplication yields homeomorphism every topological group can viewed uniform space two the left uniformity turns all left multiplications into uniformly continuous maps while the right uniformity turns all right multiplications into uniformly continuous not then these two need not the uniform structures allow one talk about notions such completeness uniform continuity and uniform convergence topological uniform every topological group completely regular follows that topological group kolmogorov then already hausdorff even tychonoff every subgroup topological group itself topological group when given the subspace topology subgroup the set left right cosets topological space when given the quotient topology the finest topology which makes the natural projection continuous one can show that the quotient map always open every open subgroup also since the complement the open set given the union open sets for normal subgroup then the factor group becomes topological group when given the quotient topology however not closed the topology then will not even therefore natural restrict oneself the category topological and restrict the definition normal normal and closed the isomorphism theorems known from ordinary group theory are not always true the topological this because bijective homomorphism need not isomorphism topological the theorems are valid one places certain restrictions the maps for the first isomorphism theorem states that homomorphism then isomorphic and only the map open onto its subgroup then the closure also likewise normal the closure topological group hausdorff and only the trivial element subgroup closed not hausdorff then one can obtain hausdorff group passing the quotient space where the closure the this equivalent taking the kolmogorov quotient the fundamental group topological group always abelian this special case the fact that the fundamental group space since topological groups are spaces relationship other areas mathematics particular importance harmonic analysis are the locally compact groups because they admit natural notion measure and integral given the haar measure the theory group representations almost identical for finite groups and for compact topological compact baire topological groups are locally this section requires expansion september generalizations various generalizations topological groups can obtained weakening the continuity semitopological group group with topology such that for each the two functions defined and are quasitopological group semitopological group which the function mapping elements their inverses also paratopological group group with topology such that the group operation see also lie group algebraic group profinite group topological ring
