topology navigation search topography topology bius strips topology from the greek place and study the mathematical study shapes and topological spaces area mathematics concerned with the properties space that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and but not tearing this includes such properties connectedness continuity and boundary topology developed field study out geometry and set theory through analysis such concepts dimension and such ideas back leibniz who the century envisioned the geometria situs latin for geometry and analysis situs latin for picking apart the term topology was introduced johann benedict listing the although was not until the first decades the century that the idea topological space was the middle the topology had become major branch topology has many general topology establishes the foundational aspects topology and investigates properties topological spaces and investigates concepts inherent topological includes point set topology which the foundational topology used all other branches including topics like compactness and connectedness algebraic topology tries measure degrees connectivity using algebraic constructs such homology and homotopy groups differential topology the field dealing with differentiable functions differentiable manifolds closely related differential geometry and together they make the geometric theory differentiable geometric topology primarily studies manifolds and their embeddings other particularly active area low dimensional topology which studies manifolds four fewer this

the investigation certain questions leonhard euler paper the seven bridges nigsberg regarded one the first academic treatises modern the term topologie was introduced german johann benedict listing vorstudien zur topologie who had used the word for ten years correspondence before its first appearance the english form topology was first used obituary the journal nature distinguish qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry which quantitative relations chiefly are the term topologist the sense specialist topology was used the magazine spectator citation needed however none these uses corresponds exactly the modern definition modern topology depends strongly the ideas set theory developed georg cantor the later part the addition establishing the basic ideas set cantor considered point sets euclidean space part his study fourier series henri published analysis situs introducing the concepts homotopy and homology which are now considered part algebraic topology unifying the work function spaces georg vito volterra cesare jacques hadamard giulio ascoli and maurice chet introduced the metric space metric space now considered special case general topological felix hausdorff coined the term topological and gave the definition for what now called hausdorff space currently topological space slight generalization hausdorff given kazimierz kuratowski citation needed for further see point set topology and algebraic topology elementary introduction topology branch mathematics can formally defined the study qualitative properties certain objects called topological spaces that are invariant under certain kind transformation called continuous map especially those properties that are invariant under certain kind equivalence called homeomorphism put more topology the study continuity and topology also used refer structure imposed upon set structure that essentially the set topological space taking proper care properties such convergence connectedness and continuity upon topological spaces show naturally almost every branch this has made topology one the great unifying ideas the motivating insight behind topology that some geometric problems depend not the exact shape the objects but rather the way they are put for the square and the circle have many properties they are both one dimensional objects from topological point and both separate the plane into two the part inside and the part one the first papers topology was the leonhard euler that was impossible find route through the town nigsberg now kaliningrad that would cross each its seven bridges exactly this result did not depend the lengths the nor their distance from one but only connectivity which bridges are connected which islands the seven bridges nigsberg famous problem introductory and led the branch mathematics known graph theory homeomorphism torus the hairy ball theorem algebraic topology says that one cannot comb the hair flat hairy ball without creating cowlick this fact immediately convincing most even though they might not recognize the more formal statement the that there nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field the sphere with the bridges nigsberg the result does not depend the shape the applies any kind smooth long has deal with these problems that not rely the exact shape the one must clear about just what properties these problems rely from this need arises the notion the impossibility crossing each bridge just once applies any arrangement bridges homeomorphic those and the hairy ball theorem applies any space homeomorphic intuitively two spaces are homeomorphic one can deformed into the other without cutting traditional joke that topologist cannot distinguish coffee mug from since sufficiently pliable doughnut could reshaped coffee cup creating dimple and progressively enlarging while shrinking the hole into precise definition involving continuous function with continuous necessarily more homeomorphism can considered the most basic topological equivalence another homotopy equivalence this harder describe without getting but the essential notion that two objects are homotopy equivalent they both result from squishing some larger introductory exercise classify the uppercase letters the english alphabet according homeomorphism and homotopy the result depends partially the font the figures use the sans serif myriad font homotopy equivalence rougher relationship than homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism the simple case homotopy equivalence described above can used here show two letters are homotopy for fits inside and the tail the can squished the hole part homeomorphism classes holes three holes four one hole one hole one one hole two two holes and bar with four tails the bar the almost too short homotopy classes are because the tails can squished down they one two and sure that the letters are classified need show that two letters the same class are equivalent and two letters different classes are not the case this can done selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters for and are not homeomorphic because removing the center point the leaves four whatever point corresponds this its removal can leave most three the case homotopy equivalence harder and requires more elaborate argument showing algebraic such the fundamental group different the supposedly differing letter topology has practical relevance stencil typography for braggadocio font stencils are made one connected piece important concepts topology topologies sets topological space the term topology also refers specific mathematical idea which central the area mathematics called informally topology used tell how elements set are related spatially each the same set can have different for the real line the complex plane and the cantor set can thought the same set with different formally let set and let family subsets then called topology both the empty set and are elements any union elements element any intersection finitely many elements element topology then the pair called topological space the notation may used denote set endowed with the particular topology the members are called open sets subset said closed its complement its complement subset may closed both clopen set the empty set and itself are always both closed and open set containing point called set with topology called topological space continuous functions and homeomorphisms continuous function homeomorphism function map from one topological space another called continuous the inverse image any open set the function maps the real numbers the real numbers both spaces with the standard then this definition continuous equivalent the definition continuous calculus continuous function one one and onto and the inverse the function also then the function called homeomorphism and the domain the function said homeomorphic the another way saying this that the function has natural extension the two spaces are they have identical topological and are considered topologically the the cube and the sphere are are the coffee cup and the but the circle not homeomorphic the manifolds manifold while topological spaces can extremely varied and many areas topology focus the more familiar class spaces known manifold topological space that resembles euclidean space near each more each point dimensional manifold has neighbourhood that homeomorphic the euclidean space dimension lines and circles but not figure eights are dimensional two dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces examples include the plane the sphere and the torus which can all realized three but also the klein bottle and real projective plane which topology topics general topology general topology general topology the branch topology dealing with the basic theoretic definitions and constructions used the foundation most other branches including differential topology geometric topology and algebraic topology another name for general topology point set topology the fundamental concepts set topology are continuity compactness and connectedness intuitively continuous functions take nearby points nearby compact sets are those which can covered finitely many sets arbitrarily small and connected sets are sets which cannot divided into two pieces which are far the words arbitrarily and far can all made precise using open described change the definition open change what continuous compact and connected sets each choice definition for open called topology set with topology called topological space metric spaces are important class topological spaces where distances can assigned number called metric having metric simplifies many and many the most common topological spaces are metric algebraic topology algebraic topology algebraic topology branch mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra study topological spaces the basic goal find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces homeomorphism though usually most classify homotopy equivalence the most important these invariants are homotopy groups homology and cohomology although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra study topological using topology solve algebraic problems sometimes also algebraic for allows for convenient proof that any subgroup free group again free differential topology differential topology differential topology the field dealing with differentiable functions differentiable manifolds closely related differential geometry and together they make the geometric theory differentiable more differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only smooth structure manifold smooth manifolds are than manifolds with extra geometric which can act obstructions certain types equivalences and deformations that exist differential for volume and riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures the same smooth that one can smoothly flatten certain but might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature geometric topology geometric topology geometric topology branch topology that primarily focuses dimensional manifolds dimensions and and their interaction with but also includes some dimensional some examples topics geometric topology are orientability handle decompositions local flatness and the planar and dimensional sch nflies theorem dimensional characteristic classes are basic and surgery theory key low dimensional topology strongly reflected the uniformization theorem dimensions every surface admits constant curvature geometrically has one possible positive zero negative hyperbolic and the geometrization conjecture now dimensions every manifold can cut into each which has one possible dimensional topology can studied complex geometry one variable riemann surfaces are complex the uniformization theorem every conformal class metrics equivalent unique complex and dimensional topology can studied from the point view complex geometry two variables complex though not every manifold admits complex generalizations occasionally one needs use the tools topology but set not pointless topology one considers instead the lattice open sets the basic notion the while grothendieck topologies are structures defined arbitrary categories that allow the definition sheaves those and with that the definition general cohomology applications topology biology knot theory branch used biology study the effects certain enzymes these enzymes twist and reconnect the causing knotting with observable effects such slower topology also used evolutionary biology represent the relationship between phenotype and phenotypic forms which appear quite different can separated only few mutations depending how genetic changes map phenotypic changes during computer science topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology determine the large scale structure set for determining cloud points spherical toroidal the main method used topological data analysis replace set data points with family simplicial complexes indexed proximity analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology specifically via the theory persistent homology encode the persistent homology data set the form parameterized version betti number which called barcode physics
