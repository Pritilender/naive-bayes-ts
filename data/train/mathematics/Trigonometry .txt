studies relationships involving lengths and angles triangles the field emerged during the century from applications geometry astronomical the century astronomers first noted that the lengths the sides angle triangle and the angles between those sides have fixed that least the length one side and the value one angle then all other angles and lengths can determined these calculations soon came defined the trigonometric functions and today are pervasive both pure and applied mathematics fundamental methods analysis such the fourier transform for the wave equation use trigonometric functions understand cyclical phenomena across many applications fields diverse mechanical and electrical music and astronomy ecology and trigonometry also the foundation surveying trigonometry most simply associated with planar right angle triangles each which dimensional triangle with one angle equal degrees the applicability angle triangles but since any angle triangle flat can bisected create two angle most problems can reduced calculations angle thus the majority applications relate angle one exception this spherical trigonometry the study triangles spheres surfaces constant positive

studied angle using division circles into degrees they and later the babylonians studied the ratios the sides similar triangles and discovered some properties these ratios but did not turn that into systematic method for finding sides and angles the ancient nubians used similar the ancient greeks transformed trigonometry into ordered the century classical greek mathematicians such euclid and archimedes studied the properties chords and inscribed angles and they proved theorems that are equivalent modern trigonometric although they presented them geometrically rather than claudius ptolemy expanded upon hipparchus chords circle his almagest the modern sine function was first defined the surya siddhanta and its properties were further documented the century indian mathematician and astronomer aryabhata these greek and indian works were translated and expanded medieval islamic mathematicians the islamic mathematicians were using all six trigonometric had tabulated their and were applying them problems spherical geometry citation needed about the same chinese mathematicians developed trigonometry although was not major field study for knowledge trigonometric functions and methods reached europe via latin translations the works persian and arabic astronomers such battani and nasir din tusi one the earliest works trigonometry european mathematician triangulis the century german mathematician regiomontanus trigonometry was still little known century europe that nicolaus copernicus devoted two chapters revolutionibus orbium coelestium explain its basic driven the demands navigation and the growing need for accurate maps large geographic trigonometry grew into major branch bartholomaeus pitiscus was the first use the publishing his trigonometria gemma frisius described for the first time the method triangulation still used today was leonhard euler who fully incorporated complex numbers into the works james gregory the century and colin maclaurin the century were influential the development trigonometric series also the brook taylor defined the general taylor series overview has been suggested that this article merged with trigonometric function discuss proposed since may trigonometric function sin cos tan one angle triangle degrees and one the other angles the third thereby because the three angles any triangle add degrees the two acute angles therefore add degrees they are complementary angles the shape triangle completely except for similarity the once the angles are the ratios the sides are regardless the overall size the the length one the sides the other two are these ratios are given the following trigonometric functions the known angle where and refer the lengths the sides the accompanying sine function defined the ratio the side opposite the angle the hypotenuse cosine function defined the ratio the adjacent leg the tangent function defined the ratio the opposite leg the adjacent the hypotenuse the side opposite the degree angle right the longest side the triangle and one the two sides adjacent angle the adjacent leg the other side that adjacent angle the opposite side the side that opposite angle the terms perpendicular and base are sometimes used for the opposite and adjacent sides many people find easy remember what sides the right triangle are equal cosine memorizing the word toa see below under mnemonics the reciprocals these functions are named the cosecant csc secant and cotangent respectively the inverse functions are called the arcsine arccosine and arctangent respectively there are arithmetic relations between these which are known trigonometric identities the cotangent and cosecant are named because they are respectively the tangent and secant the complementary angle abbreviated with these functions one can answer virtually all questions about arbitrary triangles using the law sines and the law cosines these laws can used compute the remaining angles and sides any triangle soon two sides and their included angle two angles and side three sides are these laws are useful all branches since every polygon may described finite combination extending the definitions the above definitions only apply angles between and degrees and radians using the unit circle one can extend them all positive and negative arguments see trigonometric function the trigonometric functions are periodic with period degrees radians that means their values repeat those the tangent and cotangent functions also have shorter degrees radians the trigonometric functions can defined other ways besides the geometrical definitions using tools from calculus and infinite series with these definitions the trigonometric functions can defined for complex numbers the complex exponential function particularly see euler and formulas graphing process sin using unit graphing process csc the reciprocal using unit graphing process tan using unit mnemonics mnemonics trigonometry common use
