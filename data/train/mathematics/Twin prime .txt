mathematics	twin prime navigation search twin prime prime number that has prime gap two other differs from another prime number for example the twin prime pair sometimes the term twin prime used for pair twin alternative name for this prime twin prime pair twin primes appear despite the general tendency gaps between adjacent primes become larger the numbers themselves get larger due the prime number theorem the average between primes less than list unsolved problems mathematics are there infinitely many twin contents history brun theorem other theorems weaker than the prime conjecture largest known twin prime pair properties first littlewood conjecture polignac conjecture isolated prime see also references further reading external links history the question whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one the great open questions number theory for many this the content the twin prime conjecture which there are infinitely many primes such that also polignac made the more general conjecture that for every natural number there are infinitely many prime pairs and such that the the twin prime stronger form the twin prime the littlewood conjecture see postulates distribution law for twin primes akin the prime number theorem april yitang zhang announced proof that for some integer that less than million there are infinitely many pairs primes that differ zhang paper was accepted annals mathematics early may terence tao subsequently proposed polymath project collaborative effort optimize april one year after according the polymath project the bound has been reduced further assuming the elliott halberstam conjecture and its generalized the polymath project wiki states that the bound has been reduced and respectively brun theorem viggo brun showed that the sum reciprocals the twin primes was this famous called brun theorem was the first use the brun sieve and helped initiate the development modern sieve theory the modern version argument can used show that the number twin primes less than does not exceed for some absolute constant other theorems weaker than the prime conjecture paul showed that there constant and infinitely many primes such that where denotes the next prime this result was successively helmut maier showed that constant can daniel goldston and cem showed that the constant could improved further goldston nos pintz and established that can chosen arbitrarily small assuming the elliott halberstam conjecture slightly weaker they were able show that there are infinitely many such that least two are under stronger hypothesis they showed that for infinitely many least two and are the result major improvement the the polymath project optimization bound and maynard claims have reduced the bound are further every twin prime pair except the form for some natural number and with the exception must end has been proven that the pair twin prime and only also prime then the three primes are called prime triplet largest known twin prime pair january two distributed computing projects twin prime search and primegrid found the largest known twin the numbers have decimal digits their discoverer was eric vautier france august those same two projects announced that new record twin prime had been the numbers have decimal december primegrid announced that yet another record twin prime had been the numbers have decimal empirical analysis all prime pairs shows that the number such pairs less than log then about for small and decreases towards about tends there are twin prime pairs below the limiting value conjectured equal twice the twin prime constant not confused with brun constant this conjecture would imply the twin prime but remains the twin prime conjecture would give better with the prime counting function properties the first few twin prime pairs the only even prime except for the pair twin primes are closely spaced possible for two every third odd number divisible which requires that three successive odd numbers can prime unless one them five therefore the only prime that part two along the same other than the first the number centered between the twin primes must always divisible the lower member pair definition chen prime first littlewood conjecture the hardy littlewood conjecture after hardy and john littlewood generalization the twin prime concerned with the distribution prime constellations including twin analogy the prime number theorem let denote the number primes such that also define the twin prime constant here the product extends over all prime numbers then the conjecture that the sense that the quotient the two expressions tends approaches the second not part the conjecture and proved integration parts this conjecture can justified but not assuming that describes the density function the prime assumption suggested the prime number polignac conjecture polignac conjecture from states that for every positive even natural number there are infinitely many consecutive prime pairs and such that there are infinitely many prime gaps size the case the twin prime the conjecture has not yet been proven disproven for any specific value but result proves that true for least one currently value isolated prime isolated prime prime number such that neither nor other not part twin prime for isolated prime since and are both composite the first few isolated primes are see also cousin prime prime gap prime tuple prime quadruplet prime triplet sexy prime
