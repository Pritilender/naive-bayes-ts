mathematics	vector space navigation search linear space vector space mathematical structure formed collection elements called vectors which may added together and multiplied scaled called scalars this scalars are often taken real numbers but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication complex numbers rational numbers generally any field the operations vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain called axioms listed below example vector space that euclidean vectors which may used represent physical quantities such forces any two forces the same can added yield and the multiplication force vector real multiplier another force the same but more geometric sense vectors representing displacements the plane three dimensional space also form vector vectors vector spaces not necessarily have like objects they appear the mentioned vectors are best thought abstract mathematical objects with particular which some cases can visualized vector spaces are the subject linear algebra and are well understood from this point since vector spaces are characterized their dimension which roughly specifies the number independent directions the vector space may endowed with additional such norm inner product such spaces arise naturally mathematical analysis mainly the guise dimensional function spaces whose vectors are functions analytical problems call for the ability decide whether sequence vectors converges given this accomplished considering vector spaces with additional mostly spaces endowed with suitable topology thus allowing the consideration proximity and continuity issues these topological vector spaces particular banach spaces and hilbert spaces have richer historically the first ideas leading vector spaces can traced back far analytic geometry matrices systems linear equations and euclidean the more abstract first formulated giuseppe peano encompasses more general objects than euclidean but much the theory can seen extension classical geometric ideas like lines planes and their dimensional today vector spaces are applied throughout science and engineering they are the appropriate algebraic notion deal with systems linear equations offer framework for fourier expansion which employed image compression routines provide environment that can used for solution techniques for partial differential equations furthermore vector spaces furnish coordinate free way dealing with geometrical and physical objects such tensors this turn allows the examination local properties manifolds linearization vector spaces may

topological vector spaces banach spaces hilbert spaces algebras over fields applications distributions fourier analysis differential geometry generalizations vector bundles modules affine and projective spaces see also notes footnotes references algebra analysis historical references further references external links introduction and definition the concept vector space will first explained describing two particular first arrows the plane the first example vector space consists arrows fixed plane starting one fixed this used physics describe forces velocities given any two such and the parallelogram spanned these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts the too this new arrow called the sum the two arrows and denoted another operation that can done with arrows given any positive real number the arrow that has the same direction but dilated shrunk multiplying its length called multiplication denoted when defined the arrow pointing the opposite instead the following shows few the resulting vector has the same direction but stretched the double length right image equivalently the sum moreover has the opposite direction and the same length blue vector pointing down the right second ordered pairs numbers second key example vector space provided pairs real numbers and the order the components and such pair also called ordered pair such pair written the sum two such pairs and multiplication pair with number defined and definition vector space over field set together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed elements are called vectors elements are called scalars this vectors are distinguished from scalars the two examples our set consists the planar arrows with fixed starting point and pairs real respectively while our field the real the first vector addition takes any two and and assigns them third vector which commonly written and called the sum these two the second operation takes any and any and gives another vector view the first where the multiplication done rescaling the the multiplication called scalar multiplication qualify vector the and the operations addition and multiplication must adhere number requirements called axioms the list let and arbitrary vectors and and scalars axiom meaning associativity commutativity identity element zero vector inverse elements additive inverse multiplicative identity distributivity these axioms generalize properties the vectors introduced the above indeed the result addition two ordered pairs the second example does not depend the order the the geometric example vectors since the parallelogram defining the sum the vectors independent the order the all other axioms can checked similar manner both thus disregarding the concrete nature the particular type the definition incorporates these two and many more examples one notion vector subtraction two vectors and division scalar can defined when the scalar field the real numbers the vector space called real vector space when the scalar field the complex numbers called complex vector space these two cases are the ones used most often the most general definition vector space allows scalars elements any fixed field the notion then known vector spaces vector space over field essentially set numbers possessing addition subtraction multiplication and division operations for rational numbers also form contrast the intuition stemming from vectors the plane and dimensional there general vector notion nearness angles distances deal with such particular types vector spaces are see below alternative formulations and elementary consequences the requirement that vector addition and scalar multiplication binary operations includes definition binary property called closure that and are for all and some older sources mention these properties separate the parlance abstract algebra the first four axioms can subsumed requiring the set vectors abelian group under the remaining axioms give this group module structure other words there ring homomorphism from the field into the endomorphism ring the group then scalar multiplication defined there are number direct consequences the vector space some them derive from elementary group theory applied the additive group for example the zero vector and the additive inverse any vector are other properties follow from the distributive for example equals and only equals equals history vector spaces stem from affine geometry via the introduction coordinates the plane dimensional around descartes and fermat founded analytic geometry equating solutions equation two variables with points plane curve achieve geometric solutions without using bolzano introduced certain operations lines and which are predecessors this work was made use the conception barycentric coordinates bius the foundation the definition vectors was bellavitis notion the oriented segment one whose ends the origin and the other one vectors were reconsidered with the presentation complex numbers argand and hamilton and the inception quaternions and biquaternions the they are elements and treating them using linear combinations goes back laguerre who also defined systems linear equations cayley introduced the matrix notation which allows for harmonization and simplification linear maps around the same grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated envisaged sets abstract objects endowed with his the concepts linear independence and dimension well scalar products are actually work exceeds the framework vector since his considering too led him what are today called algebras peano was the first give the modern definition vector spaces and linear maps important development vector spaces due the construction function spaces lebesgue this was later formalized banach and hilbert around that algebra and the new field functional analysis began notably with key concepts such spaces integrable functions and hilbert spaces vector including dimensional then became firmly established and many mathematical branches started making use this examples examples vector spaces coordinate spaces coordinate space the most simple example vector space over field the field equipped with its standard addition and more vector space can composed tuples sequences length elements such vector space composed all the tuples field known coordinate space usually denoted the case the above mentioned simplest which the field also regarded vector space over the case and was discussed the introduction the complex numbers and other field extensions the set complex numbers numbers that can written the form for real numbers and where the imaginary unit form vector space over the reals with the usual addition and and for real numbers and the various axioms vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number the example complex numbers essentially the same isomorphic the vector space ordered pairs real numbers mentioned think the complex number representing the ordered pair the complex plane then see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly those the earlier more field extensions provide another class examples vector particularly algebra and algebraic number theory field containing smaller field vector the given multiplication and addition operations for the complex numbers are vector space over and the field extension vector space over function spaces functions from any fixed set field also form vector performing addition and scalar multiplication that the sum two functions and the function given and similarly for such function spaces occur many geometric when the real line interval other subsets many notions topology and such continuity integrability differentiability are behaved with respect sums and scalar multiples functions possessing such property still have that therefore the set such functions are vector they are studied greater detail using the methods functional analysis see below algebraic constraints also yield vector the vector space given polynomial functions coefficients linear equations linear equation linear differential equation systems linear equations systems homogeneous linear equations are closely tied vector for the solutions are given triples with arbitrary and they form vector sums and scalar multiples such triples still satisfy the same ratios the three thus they are too matrices can used condense multiple linear equations above into one vector namely where the matrix containing the coefficients the given the vector denotes the matrix product and the zero similar the solutions homogeneous linear differential equations form vector for example yields where and are arbitrary and the natural exponential function basis and dimension basis dimension standard basis orthogonal bases allow the introduction coordinates means represent basis finite set vectors for convenience often indexed some index set that spans the whole space and linearly independent spanning the whole means that any vector can expressed finite sum called linear combination the basis where the are called the coordinates the vector with respect the basis and elements linear independence means that the coordinates are uniquely determined for any vector the vector for the coordinate vectors form basis called the standard basis since any vector can uniquely expressed linear combination these the corresponding coordinates are just the cartesian coordinates the every vector space has this follows from zorn lemma equivalent formulation the axiom choice given the other axioms zermelo fraenkel set theory the existence bases equivalent the axiom the ultrafilter lemma which weaker than the axiom implies that all bases given vector space have the same number cardinality dimension theorem for vector spaces called the dimension the vector denoted dim the space spanned finitely many the above statements can proven without such fundamental input from set the dimension the coordinate space the basis exhibited the dimension the polynomial ring introduced above countably infinite basis given fortiori the dimension more general function such the space functions some bounded interval under suitable regularity assumptions the coefficients the dimension the solution space homogeneous ordinary differential equation equals the degree the for the solution space for the above equation generated and these two functions are linearly independent over the dimension this space the degree the field extension over the rationals can thought vector space over defining vector addition field defining scalar multiplication field multiplication elements and otherwise ignoring the field the dimension degree the field extension over depends satisfies some polynomial equation algebraic the dimension more equals the degree the minimal polynomial having root for the complex numbers are dimensional real vector generated and the imaginary unit the latter satisfies equation degree thus dimensional vector space any one dimensional vector space over not the dimension over for for there such other words transcendental linear maps and matrices linear map the relation two vector spaces can expressed linear map linear transformation they are functions that reflect the vector space they preserve sums and scalar isomorphism linear map such that there exists inverse map which map such that the two possible compositions and are identity maps equivalently both one injective and onto surjective there exists isomorphism between and the two spaces are said isomorphic they are then essentially identical vector since all identities holding are via transported similar ones and vice versa via for the arrows the and ordered pairs vector spaces the introduction are planar arrow departing the origin some coordinate system can expressed ordered pair considering the and component the shown the image the conversely given pair the arrow going the right the and turns back the arrow linear maps between two fixed vector spaces form vector space hom also denoted the space linear maps from called the dual vector space denoted via the injective natural map any vector space can embedded into its bidual the map isomorphism and only the space once basis linear maps are completely determined specifying the images the basis because any element expressed uniquely linear combination dim dim correspondence between fixed bases and gives rise linear map that maps any basis element the corresponding basis element its very therefore two vector spaces are isomorphic their dimensions agree and vice another way express this that any vector space completely classified isomorphism its single any dimensional vector space isomorphic there however canonical preferred actually isomorphism equivalent the choice basis mapping the standard basis via the freedom choosing convenient basis particularly useful the dimensional see below matrices matrix determinant matrices are useful notion encode linear they are written rectangular array scalars the image the any matrix gives rise linear map from the following summation using the matrix multiplication the matrix with the coordinate vector after choosing bases and any linear map uniquely represented matrix via this parallelepiped the determinant det square matrix scalar that tells whether the associated map isomorphism sufficient and necessary that the determinant the linear transformation corresponding real matrix orientation preserving and only its determinant eigenvalues and eigenvectors eigenvalues and eigenvectors endomorphisms linear maps are particularly important since this case vectors can compared with their image under any nonzero vector satisfying where called eigenvector with eigenvalue equivalently element the kernel the difference where the identity map this can rephrased using having eigenvalue equivalent spelling out the definition the the expression the left hand side can seen polynomial function called the characteristic polynomial the field large enough contain zero this polynomial which automatically happens for algebraically closed such any linear map has least one the vector space may may not possess eigenbasis basis consisting this phenomenon governed the jordan canonical form the the set all eigenvectors corresponding particular eigenvalue forms vector space known the eigenspace corresponding the eigenvalue and achieve the spectral theorem the corresponding statement the dimensional the machinery functional analysis see below basic constructions addition the above concrete there are number standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related given addition the definitions given they are also characterized universal properties which determine object specifying the linear maps from any other vector subspaces and quotient spaces linear subspace quotient vector space origin planes nonempty subset vector space that closed under addition and scalar multiplication and therefore contains the vector called subspace subspaces are vector spaces over the same their own the intersection all subspaces containing given set vectors called its span and the smallest subspace containing the set expressed terms the span the subspace consisting all the linear combinations elements the counterpart subspaces are quotient vector spaces given any subspace the quotient space modulo defined consists where arbitrary vector the sum two such elements and and scalar multiplication given the key point this definition that and only the difference and lies this the quotient space forgets information that contained the subspace the kernel ker linear map consists vectors that are mapped both kernel and image are subspaces and respectively the existence kernels and images part the statement that the category vector spaces over fixed field abelian category corpus mathematical objects and preserving maps between them category that behaves much like the category abelian groups because many statements such the first isomorphism theorem also called rank nullity theorem related and the second and third isomorphism theorem can formulated and proven way very similar the corresponding statements for groups important example the kernel linear map for some fixed matrix above the kernel this map the subspace vectors such that which precisely the set solutions the system homogeneous linear equations belonging this concept also extends linear differential equations the corresponding map the derivatives the function appear linearly opposed for since differentiation linear procedure and for constant this assignment called linear differential operator the solutions the differential equation form vector space over direct product and direct sum direct product direct sum modules the direct product vector spaces and the direct sum vector spaces are two ways combining indexed family vector spaces into new vector the direct product family vector spaces consists the set all tuples which specify for each index some index set element addition and scalar multiplication performed variant this construction the direct sum also called coproduct and denoted where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are the index set the two constructions but general they are tensor product tensor product vector spaces the tensor product simply two vector spaces and one the central notions multilinear algebra which deals with extending notions such linear maps several map called bilinear linear both variables and that for fixed the map linear the sense above and likewise for fixed the tensor product particular vector space that universal recipient bilinear maps defined the vector space consisting finite sums symbols called tensors subject the rules commutative diagram these rules ensure that the map from the that maps tuple the universality states that given any vector space and any bilinear map there exists unique map shown the diagram with dotted whose composition with equals this called the universal property the tensor instance the much used advanced abstract indirectly define objects specifying maps from this vector spaces with additional structure from the point view linear vector spaces are completely understood insofar any vector space its however vector spaces per not offer framework deal with the crucial whether sequence functions converges another likewise linear algebra not adapted deal with infinite series since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms functional analysis much the same way the axiomatic treatment vector spaces reveals their essential algebraic studying vector spaces with additional data abstractly turns out too citation needed first example additional datum order token which vectors can for dimensional real space can ordered comparing its vectors ordered vector spaces for example riesz spaces are fundamental lebesgue integration which relies the ability express function difference two positive functions where denotes the positive part and the negative normed vector spaces and inner product spaces normed vector space inner product space measuring vectors done specifying norm datum which measures lengths inner product which measures angles between norms and inner products are denoted and respectively the datum inner product entails that lengths vectors can defined defining the associated norm vector spaces endowed with such data are known normed vector spaces and inner product spaces respectively coordinate space can equipped with the standard dot product this reflects the common notion the angle between two vectors and the law cosines because two vectors satisfying are called orthogonal important variant the standard dot product used minkowski space endowed with the lorentz product contrast the standard dot not positive definite also takes negative for example for singling out the fourth corresponding time opposed three makes useful for the mathematical treatment special relativity topological vector spaces topological vector space convergence questions are treated considering vector spaces carrying compatible topology structure that allows one talk about elements being close each other compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have continuous maps roughly and and vary bounded then and make sense specifying the amount scalar the field also has carry topology this common choice are the reals the complex such topological vector spaces one can consider series the infinite sum denotes the limit the corresponding finite partial sums the sequence elements for the could real functions belonging some function space which case the series function series the mode convergence the series depends the topology imposed the function such pointwise convergence and uniform convergence are two prominent unit spheres norms way ensure the existence limits certain infinite series restrict attention spaces where any cauchy sequence has such vector space called complete roughly vector space complete provided that contains all necessary for the vector space polynomials the unit interval equipped with the topology uniform convergence not complete because any continuous function can uniformly approximated sequence the weierstrass approximation theorem the space all continuous functions with the same topology norm gives rise topology defining that sequence vectors converges and only banach and hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are respectively norm and inner their key piece functional analysis focusses dimensional vector since all norms dimensional topological vector spaces give rise the same notion the image the right shows the equivalence the norm and norm the unit balls enclose each sequence converges zero one norm and only does the other the dimensional however there will generally inequivalent which makes the study topological vector spaces richer than that vector spaces without additional from conceptual point all notions related topological vector spaces should match the for instead considering all linear maps also called functionals maps between topological vector spaces are required the consists continuous functionals the fundamental hahn banach theorem concerned with separating subspaces appropriate topological vector spaces continuous banach spaces banach space banach spaces introduced stefan banach are complete normed vector first example the vector space consisting infinite vectors with real entries whose norm given the topologies the dimensional space are inequivalent for different the sequence vectors the first components are the following ones are converges the zero vector for but does not for more generally than sequences real functions are endowed with norm that replaces the above sum the lebesgue integral the space integrable functions given domain for example satisfying and equipped with this norm are called lebesgue spaces denoted these spaces are one uses the riemann integral instead the space not complete which may seen justification for integration concretely this means that for any sequence integrable functions with satisfying the condition there exists function belonging the vector space such that imposing boundedness conditions not only the but also its derivatives leads sobolev spaces hilbert spaces hilbert space complete inner product spaces are known hilbert spaces honor david hilbert the hilbert space with inner product given where denotes the complex conjugate key hilbert space any cauchy sequence converges conversely finding sequence functions with desirable properties that approximates given limit equally early the guise the taylor approximation established approximation differentiable functions the stone weierstrass theorem every continuous function can approximated closely desired similar approximation technique trigonometric functions commonly called fourier expansion and much applied see below closure such set functions called basis its cardinality known the hilbert space dimension not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions sufficient for approximation but together with the gram schmidt process enables one construct basis orthogonal vectors such orthogonal bases are the hilbert space generalization the coordinate axes dimensional euclidean space the solutions various differential equations can interpreted terms hilbert for great many fields physics and engineering lead such equations and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used basis often example from the dependent schr dinger equation quantum mechanics describes the change physical properties means partial differential equation whose solutions are called wavefunctions definite values for physical properties such correspond eigenvalues certain differential operator and the associated wavefunctions are called eigenstates the spectral theorem compact operator algebras over fields algebra over field lie algebra hyperbola coordinate ring general vector spaces not possess multiplication between vector space equipped with additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication two vectors algebra over field many algebras stem from functions some geometrical since functions with values given field can multiplied these entities form the weierstrass theorem mentioned above for relies banach algebras which are both banach spaces and commutative algebra makes great use rings polynomials one several introduced above their multiplication both commutative and associative these rings and their quotients form the basis algebraic geometry because they are rings functions algebraic geometric objects another crucial example are lie algebras which are neither commutative nor but the failure limited the constraints denotes the product and anticommutativity and jacobi identity examples include the vector space matrices with the commutator two and endowed with the cross product the tensor algebra formal way adding products any vector space obtain vector spanned called simple tensors degree the multiplication given concatenating such imposing the distributive law under and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product much the same way with the tensor product two vector spaces introduced above there are relations between and forcing two such elements equal leads the symmetric algebra whereas forcing yields the exterior algebra when explicitly common term used algebra applications vector spaces have manifold applications they occur many namely wherever functions with values some field are they provide framework deal with analytical and geometrical are used the fourier this list not many more applications for example optimization the minimax theorem game theory stating the existence unique payoff when all players play optimally can formulated and proven using vector spaces representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding linear algebra and vector spaces other mathematical domains such group theory distributions distribution distribution generalized function linear map assigning number each test function typically smooth function with compact support continuous the above terminology the space distributions the dual the test function the latter space endowed with topology that takes into account not only itself but also all its higher standard example the result integrating test function over some domain when the set consisting single this reduces the dirac distribution denoted which associates test function its value the distributions are powerful instrument solve differential since all standard analytic notions such derivatives are they extend naturally the space therefore the equation question can transferred distribution which bigger than the underlying function that more flexible methods are available for solving the for green functions and fundamental solutions are usually distributions rather than proper and can then used find solutions the equation with prescribed boundary the found solution can then some cases proven actually true and solution the original equation using the lax milgram theorem consequence the riesz representation theorem fourier analysis fourier analysis resolving periodic function into sum trigonometric functions forms fourier series technique much used physics and the underlying vector
