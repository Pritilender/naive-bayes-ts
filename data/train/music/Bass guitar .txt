musician and inventor paul tutmarc from seattle washington who was manufacturing lap steel guitars developed the first electric string bass its modern fretted instrument designed played the sales catalog for electronic musical instrument audiovox featured his model bass fiddle solid fretted electric bass instrument with inch scale the adoption guitar form made the instrument easier hold and than any the existing stringed bass the addition frets enabled bassists play tune more easily than acoustic electric upright around these instruments were made during this around tutmarc bud began marketing similar bass under the serenader brand prominently advertised the nationally distributed heater music company wholesale jobber catalogue however the tutmarc family inventions did not achieve market precision bass the leo fender with the help his employee george developed the first produced electric his fender precision bass introduced became widely copied industry the precision bass evolved from uncontoured slab body design similar that telecaster with single coil pickup contoured body design with beveled edges for comfort and single pole single coil clarification needed this split introduced appears have been two mandolin pickups fender was marketing four string solid body electric mandolin the the pole pieces and leads the coils were reversed with respect each producing humbucking effect fender standard jazz bass the fender was revolutionary new which could easily transported and amplified just about any volume without feeding back monk montgomery was the first bass player tour with the fender bass with lionel postwar big band roy and shifty henry with louis jordan his tympany five were other early fender bass bill black playing with elvis presley adopted the fender precision bass around the bass guitar was intended appeal guitarists well upright bass and many early pioneers the such carol kaye and joe osborn were originally following gibson released the first short scale violin shaped electric bass with extendable end allowing played upright gibson renamed the electric bass the the was reissued around but this time without the end also gibson released the maple arched top described the gibson catalogue body electric bass that features baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics these were followed the more looking bass the was very similar gibson appearance although the earliest examples have sided body shape closer that the cutaway les paul gibson whereas fender basses had pickups mounted positions between the base the neck and the top the many early basses featured one humbucking pickup mounted directly against the neck the introduced also had the bridge gibson basses also tended sleeker gibson did not produce scale bass until with the release the thunderbird which was also the first gibson bass use humbucking pickups more traditional about halfway between the neck and small number other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the kay and danelectro saw the appearance the german trade fair musikmesse the distinctive fner violin bass made using violin construction techniques walter fner second generation violin the instrument often known the beatle due its endorsement paul mccartney rickenbacker introduced the model bass the first bass feature body the fender and gibson versions used and with the explosion the popularity rock music the many more manufacturers began making electric first introduced the fender jazz bass was known the deluxe bass and was meant accompany the jazzmaster guitar the jazz bass often referred featured two coil one close the bridge and one the precision split coil pickup the earliest production basses had volume and tone control for each this was soon changed the familiar configuration volume control for each and passive tone the jazz neck was narrower the nut than the precision bass versus another visual difference that set the jazz bass apart from the precision its body pickup shapes electric basses are often referred pickups reference the visual and electrical differences between the precision bass and jazz bass pickups fender also began production the mustang bass scale length instrument used bassists such tina weymouth talking heads and bill wyman the rolling stones and basses have scale length design echoed most current production electric basses all the and the instrument was often called the fender due fender early dominance the gibson introduced the scale bass the gibson favoured jack bruce cream citation needed the saw the founding music man instruments tom forrest white and leo which produced the stingray the first widely produced bass with active electronics this amounts impedance buffering amplifier board the instrument lower the output impedance the pickup increasing end and overall frequency response more lows and specific models became identified with particular styles such the rickenbacker series which became identified with progressive rock bassists like chris squire yes and geddy lee rush while the stingray was used louis johnson the funk band the brothers johnson alembic established the template for what became known boutique electric bass these custom tailored used phil lesh jack casady and stanley featured unique premium finished wood onboard electronics for preamplification and and innovative construction techniques such laminate neck body construction and graphite the alembic and other boutique bass such tobias produced string and string basses with low string bassist anthony jackson commissioned luthier carl thompson build string bass tuned low present the bass designers continued explore new ned steinberger introduced headless bass and continued his innovations the using graphite and other new materials and introducing the transtrem tremolo bar the guild guitar corporation launched the fretless ashbory bass which used silicone rubber strings and piezoelectric pickup achieve double sound with short scale the late mtv unplugged show which featured bands performing with acoustic helped popularize bodied acoustic bass guitars amplified with during the string basses became more widely available and more increasing number bassists genres ranging from metal gospel began using string instruments for added lower low onboard powered electronics such preamplifiers and equalizer which were previously only available expensive boutique instruments became increasingly available modestly priced the some bass manufacturers included digital modelling circuits inside the instrument recreate tones and sounds from many models basses line variax traditional bass designs such the fender precision bass and fender jazz bass remained popular the anniversary bass was introduced fender along with the introduction the scale fender jaguar bass design considerations bass bodies are typically made although other materials such graphite for some the steinberger designs have also been while wide variety woods are suitable for use the neck and fretboard the bass the most common type wood used for the body alder for the neck maple and for the fretboard rosewood other commonly used woods include maple ash walnut and poplar for mahogany for and maple and ebony for other design options include such wax and flat and carved luthier produced designed headless which have tuning machines the bridge the instrument steinberger and hohner designs and several artificial materials such luthite the use artificial materials basslab allows for unique production techniques such produce complex body while most basses have solid they can also include hollow chambers increase the resonance reduce the weight the some basses are built with entirely hollow which change the tone and resonance the acoustic bass guitars are typically equipped with piezoelectric magnetic pickups and instruments handmade highly skilled luthiers are becoming increasingly exotic materials include woods such bubinga wenge ovangkol ebony and goncalo alves graphite composite used make lightweight necks exotic woods are used more expensive for alembic uses cocobolo body top layer material because its attractive warwick bass guitars are also well known for exotic most the necks are made and the fingerboards wenge solid bubinga bodies are also used for tonal and aesthetic common feature more expensive basses construction instead milling the body from single piece wood bookmatched halves and then attaching the neck into pocket called design neck through bases are constructed first assembling the which may comprise three five more layers wood vertical which are longer than the length the this elongated the body attached two wings which may also made several the entire bass then milled and many players believe neck through construction provides better sustain and mellower tone than bolt neck while through construction most common handmade boutique basses some models produced basses such btb series also have through bolt neck construction necessarily imply cheaply made virtually all traditional fender designs still use necks for instruments costing thousands and many boutique luthiers build basses well the number frets installed bass guitar neck may the original fender basses had frets and most bass guitars have between and frets fret instruments with between and frets and octaves also the long scale necks leo with scale length distance between nut and bridge inches set the standard for electric although inch short instruments such the fner violin played paul mccartney and the fender mustang bass are also while and scale lengths were once only available boutique instruments the many manufacturers began offering these extra scale this extra long scale provides higher string which may yield more defined tone the low string and stringed instruments detuned string fretted and fretless basses another design consideration for the bass whether use frets the fretted the frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions fretless basses have distinct because the absence frets means that the string must pressed down directly onto the wood the fingerboard with the double bass the string buzzes against the wood and somewhat muted because the sounding portion the string direct contact with the flesh the the fretless bass allows players use the expressive devices glissando vibrato and microtonal intonations such quarter tones and just intonation while fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion bassists from other genres have always used fretless such freebo rick danko rod clements steve digiorgio colin edwin progressive some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses according the type material they are pino palladino tony levin the first fretless bass guitar was made bill wyman when converted inexpensive japanese fretted bass removing the the first production fretless bass was the ampeg aub introduced and fender introduced fretless precision bass around rick danko from the band began use ampeg which modified with fender heard the cahoots studio album and the rock ages album recorded live danko challenge play fretless because you have really use your the early fusion jazz bassist jaco pastorius created his own fretless bass removing the frets from fender jazz filling the holes with wood and coating the fretboard with epoxy some fretless basses have fret markers inlaid the fingerboard while others only use guide marks the side the tapewound double bass and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass the metal string windings not wear down the fingerboard some fretless basses have epoxy coated fingerboards increase the enhance sustain and give brighter strings and tuning bass guitar tuning worm gears the standard design for the electric bass guitar has four strings tuned and fourths such that the open highest eleventh octave and below middle making the tuning all four strings the same that the double bass this tuning also the same the standard tuning the lower four strings string only octave string types include metal strings roundwound flatwound halfwound ground and pressure wound well metal strings with different such tapewound and the variety materials used the strings gives bass players range tonal the and early bassists mostly used flatwound strings with smooth which had damped sound reminiscent double the late and roundwound bass strings similar guitar strings became though flatwounds also remain roundwounds have brighter timbre with longer sustain than variety tuning options and number string courses have been used extend the range the facilitate different modes the most common are five six washburn four strings with alternative tunings obtain extended lower tuning fifths gives extended upper and lower five strings usually tuned which provides extended lower another common tuning used early string basses known tenor this still popular tuning for jazz and solo other tunings such are used rare the fifth string provides greater lower range low greater upper range high string than the string and gives access more notes for any given hand the earliest five string was created fender the fender bass used the but was unpopular and discontinued the common low five string was created jimmy johnson custom instrument bought string alembic bass replaced the and used thick low string from ghs accommodate the instrument steinberger made string headless instrument called the and later yamaha offered the first production model the six strings are usually tuned like string bass with additional low string and high string some players prefer which preserves the intervals standard guitar tuning and makes the highest and lowest string the same note two octaves while less common than four string they appear jazz and other well studio work where single instrument must highly alternative tunings for string bass include matching the first five strings acoustic electric and completely matching the tuning string guitar but one octave lower allowing the use guitar chord rarer tunings such and provide lower higher range given position while maintaining consistent string the original string bass was the citation needed created danelectro guitar tuned down octave anthony jackson worked with carl thompson create the contrabass guitar later jackson brought his ideas fodera cooperation with ken smith create spaced contrabass which evolved the modern string eight and twelve string models are both built the same course string concept found twelve string guitars where sets strings are spaced together groups two three that are primarily played these instruments typically have one the strings each course tuned octave above the string although fifth above also instruments with and strings grouped courses also detuners such the are mechanical devices the player operates with the thumb the fretting quickly retune one more strings set lower hipshots typically drop the string down four string alternative range approaches some bassists use other types tuning extended the range get other such providing multiple octaves notes any given larger tonal instrument types tunings used for this purpose include basses with fewer than four strings string bass two string bass three string bass guitars tuned and alternative tunings tenor extended range basses are basses with six twelve with the additional strings used for range rather than unison octave string bass was built luthier michael tobias this commissioned bassist garry was early example bass with more than six single course south american erb player igor saavedra designed one the first string erbs and asked luthier alfonso iturra build for conklin builds custom erb the guitarbass string instrument with four bass strings tuned and six guitar strings tuned luthier michael adler built the first string bass and completed the first course string bass adler and string instruments have the same range grand sub contra such being have been ibanez had released viisc featuring scale and narrower and tuned the company dubbed cross between bass and better needed warwick released new thumb bass for jeroen paul featuring scale with contra tuning yves carbonne developed and string fretless bass piccolo basses are cosmetically similar stringed electric bass but usually tuned one whole octave higher than normal the first electric piccolo bass was constructed luthier carl thompson for stanley clarke allow for the raised the strings will and the length the neck the scale may several companies manufacture piccolo sets that can put any regular thereby converting any bass into piccolo because the thinner new nut may required hold the some people prefer slightly shorter such the tuning varies with the personal tastes the does the number joey demaio from the heavy metal band manowar plays with four strings his piccolo jazz bassist john patitucci used string piccolo unaccompanied his song his album one more angel michael manring has used string piccolo bass several altered michael uses addario exl piccolo bass strings his string made zon guitars pickups and amplification for more information see pick music magnetic pickups most electric bass guitars use magnetic the vibrations the ferrous metal strings within the magnetic field the permanent magnets magnetic pickups produce small variations the magnetic flux threading the coils the this turn produces small electrical voltages the these level signals are then amplified and played through since the basses are often available with powered active electronics that boost the provide equalization controls boost cut bass and treble precision pickups which refers the fender precision also referred are two distinct single coil pickups each offset small amount along the length the body that each half underneath two the pickups are wound with reversed magnetic polarity reduce this makes the pickup humbucking single coil less common the coil pickup used the original fender precision style pickups are generally placed the neck middle position but some luthiers and performers have used pickups the bridge between two jazz jazz pickups referring the original fender jazz also referred are wider pole pickups that lie underneath all four pickups are typically single coil designs though there are large number humbucking traditionally two them are one them near the bridge and another closer the with the halves the pickups are wound with reverse magnetic result they have hum canceling properties when used the same with hum cancellation decreasing when the pickups are used unequal volume and altogether absent when each pickup used style pickups tend have lower output and thinner sound than style pickups making perfect for most rock many bassists combine pickup the bridge and pickup the neck they can blend the two dual coil humbucker pickups sometimes abbreviated pickups have two signal producing coils that are reverse wound around opposed polarity magnets similar principle the two individual this significantly reduces noise from interference compared single coil humbuckers also often produce higher output level than single coil dual coil pickups come two main ceramic ceramic and ceramic only magnets have relatively harsher sound than their ceramic and steel and are thus used more commonly heavier rock known bass humbucker the pickup used the music man series has two each with four large this style known the pickup for this and many aftermarket pickup manufacturers and custom builders incorporate these pickups their the most common configurations are single pickup the two pickups similar placement jazz pickup the bridge with coil pickup often the these pickups can often tapped meaning one the two coils can essentially turned giving sound similar coil soapbar pickups are named due their resemblance bar soap and originally referred the gibson guitar the term also used describe any pickup with rectangular shape and visible pole most the pickups falling into this category are they are commonly found basses designed for the rock and metal such gibson esp guitars and schecter however they are also found and string basses made popular jazz and fusion such trb and various peavey model soapbar are also called extended housing many basses have just one typically soapbar multiple pickups are also quite two the most common configurations being near the neck and near the bridge fender precision bass fender precision bass two pickups fender soapbar configuration also very especially basses makes such ibanez and yamaha combination other coil pickup the neck and music style humbucker the bridge has become popular among boutique giving very focused tone that good for funk and some basses use more unusual pickup such soapbar and pickup found some stu hamm urge basses which have pickup sandwiched between two pickups and some bootsy collins custom which had many another unusual pickup configuration found some the custom basses that billy sheehan uses which there one humbucker the neck and coil pickup the middle the placement the pickup greatly affects the pickup near the neck joint emphasizes the fundamental and order harmonics and thus produces bassier while pickup near the bridge emphasizes order harmonics and makes tighter sharper sound usually basses with multiple pickups allow blending the output from the with electrical and acoustical interactions between the two pickups such partial phase allowing range tonal non magnetic pickups the use magnetic pickups allows bassists use ferrous strings such brass even silicone rubber which create different piezoelectric pickups also called piezo pickups are magnetic pickups that use transducer convert vibrations the body bridge into electrical they are typically mounted under the bridge saddle near the bridge and produce different tone from magnetic often similar that acoustic piezo pickups are often used acoustic bass guitars allow for amplification without optical pickups are another type magnetic they use infrared led optically track the movement the which allows them reproduce frequency tones high volumes without the hum excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic since optical pickups not pick high frequencies percussive sounds they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups fill the missing lightwave systems builds basses with optical amplification and effects bass instrument amplification like the electric guitar the electric bass guitar often connected amplifier and speaker with patch cord for live electric bassists use either combo amplifier which combines amplifier and speaker single amplifier and separate speaker cabinet some when the bass used with scale amplification plugged into direct box which routes the signal directly into mixing console and thence the main and monitor recording may use microphone setup front the amplifier speaker for the amplified direct box that feeds the recording mix various electronic bass effects such preamplifiers stomp style pedals and signal processors and the configuration the amplifier and speaker can used alter the basic sound the the and early signal processors such equalizers overdrive devices sometimes referred fuzz bass and compressors limiters became increasingly modulation effects like flanging phase and time effects such delay and looping are less commonly used with bass than with electric but they are used some styles playing techniques sitting standing most bass players stand while although sitting also particularly large ensemble such jazz big bands acoustic genres such folk some such jah wobble alternate between standing seated matter the preference which position gives the greatest ease playing and what bandleader when right handed players can balance the instrument the right thigh like classical guitar the balancing the bass the left thigh usually positions such way that mimics the standing allowing for less difference between the standing and sitting balancing the bass the right thigh provides better access the neck and fretboard its especially lower performing techniques contrast the upright bass double the electric bass guitar played horizontally across the like electric when the strings are plucked with the fingers pizzicato the index and middle fingers and sometimes with the ring and little fingers are james jamerson influential bassist from the motown era played intricate bass lines using only his index which called the there are also variations how bassist chooses rest the hand thumb left thumb the case handed player may rest his her thumb the top edge one the pickups the side the which especially common among bassists who have upright bass some bassists anchor their thumbs the lowest string and move off play the low alternatively the thumb can rested loosely the strings mute the unused the string can plucked any point between the bridge and the point where the fretting hand holding down the different timbres are produced depending where along the string when plucked closer the the string produces more pronounced giving brighter closer the middle the string that harmonics are less giving more mellow bassists trying emulate the sound double bass sometimes pluck the strings with their thumb and use palm muting create thumpy tone the late monk montgomery who played lionel and bruce palmer who performed with buffalo springfield use thumb the use the thumb was acknowledged early fender which came with thumbrest tug attached the pickguard below the contrary its this was not used rest the but provide leverage while using the thumb pluck the the thumbrest was moved above the strings models true and eliminated the slap and slapping the slap and pop method thumbstyle most associated with funk uses tones and percussive sounds achieved thumping slapping string with the thumb and snapping popping string strings with the index middle bassists often interpolate left muted dead notes between the slaps and pops achieve rapid percussive and after note slapped the fretting hand may cause other notes sound using hammer ons pull offs hand glissando larry graham sly and the family stone and graham central station was early innovator the slap and louis johnson the brothers johnson also credited early slap bass slap and pop style also used many bassists other such rock burnel and les claypool metal eric langlois martin mendez fieldy and ryan martinie and fusion marcus miller victor wooten and alain caron slap style playing was popularized throughout the and early pop bass players such mark king from level and rock bassists such with pino palladino currently member the john mayer trio and bassist for the who flea from the red hot chili peppers and alex katunich from incubus spank bass developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass percussion striking the strings above the pickups with open palmed wooten popularized the double which the string slapped the upstroke and downstroke for more see classical thump rarely used playing technique related slapping the use wooden dowel funk fingers approach popularized tony levin picking techniques the pick plectrum used obtain more articulate for just personal although the use pick primarily associated with rock and punk rock picks are also used other jazz bassist steve swallow often plays with citation needed while pink floyd bassist roger waters uses one for heavier picks can used with alternating downstrokes and with all downstrokes for more consistent the pick usually held with the index and with the down plucking motion supplied the there are many varieties picks but due the heavier strings the electric bassists tend use heavier picks than those used for electric typically ranging from different materials are used for including nylon and all which produce different felt picks are used emulate fingerstyle palm muting techniques palm muting widely used bass the outer edge the palm the picking hand rested the bridge while and mutes the shortening the sustain the harder the palm the more string area that contacted the the shorter the the sustain the picked note can varied for each note the shorter sustain muted note electric bass can used imitate the shorter sustain and character upright palm muting commonly done while using but can also done without when doing strokes with the one prominent example the muting combination paul mccartney who has consistently used this technique for sting also uses but often does without using the thumb and first finger fretting techniques the fretting the left hand for handed bass players and the right hand for handed bass used press down the strings play different notes and shape the tone timbre plucked picked the fundamental technique used the fretting hand known finger per where each finger the fretting hand plays one fret given also the double bass technique can used for this technique involves the use four fingers the space three especially the lower when considering the spacing between this comfortable distance for the average hand the main advantage the four fingers three technique less tendon leading diminished likelihood repetitive strain injury the technique demonstrated the image below bassist performing the fretting hand can used change sounded either fully muting after plucked picked shorten its duration partially muting near the bridge reduce the volume the make the note die away the fretting hand often used mute strings that are not being played and stop the sympathetic particularly when the player wants dry focused sound the other the sympathetic resonance harmonically related strings may desired for some such these bassist can fret harmonically related for while fretting sustained the third fret the string underneath major chord being played piano bassist might hold down the and low below this note their harmonics sound the fretting hand can add vibrato plucked picked either narrow vibrato more wide vibrato with bigger pitch for fretted vibrato always alternation between the pitch the note and slightly higher for fretless the player can use this style they can alternate between the note and slightly lower while vibrato mostly done stopped notes that notes that are pressed down the open strings can also vibratoed pressing down the string behind the the fretting hand can used bend plucked picked note create the opposite bend the string pushed higher pitch before being plucked picked and then allowed fall the regular pitch after though some bassists may use tremolo bar equipped bass produce the same addition pressing down one note bassists can also press down several notes one time with their fretting hand perform while chords are used less often bassists than electric variety chords can performed the electric especially with instruments with higher ranges such string another variation fully pressing down string gently graze the string with the finger the harmonic node points the which creates like upper glissando effect which the fretting hand slides down the subtle glissando can performed moving the fretting hand without plucking picking the for more pronounced the string plucked picked metal hardcore punk pick may scraped along the sides the the fretting hand can also used sound either plucking open string with the fretting the case string that has already been plucked hammering higher pitch pulling finger pluck lower fretted open stringed jazz bassists use subtle form fretting hand pizzicato plucking very brief open string grace note with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the plucking when string rapidly hammered the note can prolonged into trill two handed tapping the handed tapping styles bassists use both hands play notes the fretboard rapidly pressing and holding the string the instead plucking picking the string create this the action striking the string against the fret the fretboard creates the since two hands can used play the this makes possible play interweaving contrapuntal lines simultaneously play bass line and simple play chords and bassist john entwistle the who tapped percussively the causing them strike the fretboard with twangy sound create style fills citation needed players noted for this technique include cliff burton billy sheehan stuart hamm john myung victor wooten les claypool mark

also play lot and play lot open just play like bass there are complaints about from time not like having bass like having deep jazz and jazz fusion the electric bass relative newcomer the world jazz the big bands the and swing era and the small combos the bebop and hard bop movements all used the double bass the electric bass was introduced some bands the and became prominent during the late and early when rock influences were blended with jazz create jazz rock fusion the introduction the electric bass jazz the rock helped bassists play volume stadium concerts with powerful because easier amplify the electric bass than the double bass the latter prone feedback volume the electric bass has both accompaniment and soloing role jazz the bassist may perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate the double for latin salsa tunes and infused jazz fusion the electric bass may play syncopated rhythmic figures coordination with the lay down heavy jazz the electric bass tends have much more expansive solo role than most popular most rock the bass guitarist may only have few short bass breaks brief solos during during
