valuable keyboard more varied form than those with some pieces three four baroque music generally uses many harmonic fantasies and does not concentrate that much the structure the musical musical phrases and the classical the harmonic functions are however the structure the the phrases and are much more important the tunes than the baroque another important break with the past was the radical overhaul opera christoph willibald gluck who cut away great deal the layering and improvisational ornament and focused the points modulation and making these moments where the harmony changes more enabled powerful dramatic shifts the emotional color the highlight these episodes used changes melody and mode among the most successful composers his gluck spawned many one whom was antonio salieri

pre classical other times early classical citation needed period where some composers still working the baroque style though sometimes thought being more the past than the handel and telemann all composed well beyond the point which the homophonic style clearly the musical culture was caught the masters the older style had the but the public hungered for the this one the reasons bach was held

and dozens symphonies were composed and there were bands players associated with opera other vocal music was the feature most musical with concertos and symphonies arising from the overture serving instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church over the course the classical symphonies and concertos developed and were presented independently vocal the normal ensemble body strings supplemented and movements particular rhythmic character were established the late however the length and weight pieces was still set with some baroque individual movements still focused one affect had only one sharply contrasting middle and their length was not significantly greater than baroque there was not yet clearly enunciated theory how compose the new was moment ripe for many consider this breakthrough have been made bach gluck and several indeed bach and gluck are often considered founders the classical the first great master the style was the composer joseph haydn the late began composing and had composed triptych morning noon and evening solidly the contemporary kapellmeister and later his output composed over forty symphonies the and while his fame his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and his voice was only one among while some suggest that was overshadowed mozart and would difficult overstate centrality the new and therefore the future western art music the before the eminence mozart and with johann sebastian bach known primarily connoisseurs keyboard haydn reached place music that set him above all other composers except perhaps george frideric took existing and radically altered how they earning him the titles father the symphony and father the string quartet one the forces that worked impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring what would later called romanticism the sturm und drang storm and phase the short period where obvious emotionalism was stylistic haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing with sharpened character and this period faded away music and however influenced what came afterward and would eventually component aesthetic taste later the farewell symphony minor exemplifies integration the differing demands the new with surprising sharp turns and long adagio end the haydn completed his opus set six string which deployed the polyphonic techniques had gathered from the previous era provide structural coherence capable holding together his melodic for this marks the beginning the mature classical which the period reaction against late baroque complexity yielded period integration baroque and classical circa musical development having worked for over decade the music director for had far more resources and scope for composing than most and also the ability shape the forces that would play his this opportunity was not beginning quite early his sought press forward the technique building ideas his next important breakthrough was the opus string quartets which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the often momentarily unclear what melody and what this changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments transition and climactic the music flows smoothly and without obvious then took this integrated style and began applying orchestral and vocal haydn gift music was way way structuring which was the same time accord with the governing aesthetic the new however younger wolfgang amadeus mozart brought his genius ideas and applied them two the major genres the opera and the virtuoso whereas haydn spent much his working life court mozart wanted public success the concert life this meant and meant performing haydn was not virtuoso the international touring nor was seeking create operatic works that could play for many nights front large mozart wanted moreover mozart also had taste for more chromatic chords and greater contrasts harmonic language greater love for creating welter melodies single and more italianate sensibility music music and later his study the polyphony the means discipline and enrich his mozart rapidly came the attention who hailed the new studied his and considered the younger man his only true peer haydn found greater range dramatic effect and melodic the learning relationship moved two mozart arrival vienna brought acceleration the development the classical there mozart absorbed the fusion italianate brilliance and germanic cohesiveness that had been brewing for the previous years his own taste for rhythmically complex melodies and long cantilena and virtuoso flourishes was merged with appreciation for formal coherence and internal this point that war and inflation halted trend larger orchestras and forced the disbanding reduction many theater this pressed the classical style toward seeking greater ensemble and technical for scattering the melody across using thirds highlight the melody taken this process placed premium chamber music for more public giving further boost the string quartet and other small ensemble was during this decade that public taste increasingly recognize that haydn and mozart had reached higher standard the time mozart arrived age the dominant styles vienna were recognizably connected the emergence the the early classical the end the changes performance the relative standing instrumental and vocal technical demands and stylistic unity had become established the composers who imitated mozart and during this decade mozart composed his most famous his six late symphonies that helped redefine the

dramatic international publication and touring had grown and concert societies notation became more more and schematics for works had been simplified yet became more varied their exact working just before with his reputation spreading haydn was poised for series notably his late oratorios and london symphonies composers paris rome and all over germany turned haydn and mozart for their ideas joseph karl stieler the time was again ripe for dramatic the new generation born around emerged while they had grown with the earlier they heard the recent works haydn and mozart vehicle for greater luigi cherubini settled paris and composed lodoiska opera that raised him its style clearly reflective the mature haydn and and its instrumentation gave weight that had not yet been felt the grand opera his contemporary tienne hul extended instrumental effects with his opera euphrosine coradin from which followed series the most fateful the new generation was ludwig van beethoven who launched his numbered works with set three piano which remain the somewhat younger than the though equally accomplished because his youthful study under mozart and his native was johann nepomuk hummel hummel studied under haydn was friend beethoven and franz schubert concentrated more the piano than any other and his time london and generated the composition and publication three piano opus which idiomatically used techniques avoiding the expected and sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso taken these composers can seen the vanguard broad change style and the center they studied one copied one gestures and occasion behaved like quarrelsome the crucial differences with the previous wave can seen the downward shift increasing durations the acceptance mozart and haydn the greater use keyboard the shift from vocal writing pianistic writing the growing pull the minor and modal and the increasing importance varying accompanying figures bring texture forward element the late classical was
