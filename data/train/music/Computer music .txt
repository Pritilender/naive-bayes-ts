history computer music programming languages much the work computer music has drawn the relationship between music theory and mathematics the first computer play music was csirac which was designed and built trevor pearcey and maston mathematician geoff hill programmed the csirac play popular musical melodies from the very early publicly played the colonel bogey march which known recordings however csirac played standard repertoire and was not used extend musical thinking composition practice which current music the oldest known recordings computer generated music were played the ferranti mark computer commercial version the baby machine from the university manchester the autumn the music program was written christopher strachey during session recorded the bbc the machine managed work its way through baa baa black god save the and part the two further major developments were the origins digital sound synthesis and algorithmic composition programs beyond rote max mathews bell laboratories developed the influential music program and its further popularising computer music through article science amongst other the musical chemists lejaren hiller and leonard isaacson worked series algorithmic composition experiments from manifested the premiere the illiac suite for string japan experiments computer music date back when keio university professor sekine and toshiba engineer hayashi experimented with the tosbac computer this resulted piece entitled tosbac suite influenced the illiac suite later japanese computer music compositions include piece kenjiro ezaki presented during osaka expo and panoramic music critic akimichi ezaki also published article called contemporary music and since japanese research computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes popular music though some the more serious japanese musicians used large computer systems such the fairlight the early music programs typically did not run real time programs would run for hours dollar generate few minutes one way around this was use hybrid most notably the roland microcomposer where microprocessor based system controls analog synthesizer released john chowning work synthesis from the the allowed much more efficient digital eventually leading the development the affordable based yamaha digital synthesizer released addition the yamaha the advent inexpensive digital chips and microcomputers opened the door time generation computer the japanese personal computers such the nec came installed with synthesis sound chips and featured audio programming languages such music macro language and midi interfaces which were most often used produce video game music chiptunes the early the performance based computers reached the point that time generation computer music using more general programs and algorithms became interesting sounds must have fluidity and changeability that allows them remain fresh the computer music this subtle ingredient bought high computational both terms the number items requiring detail score and the amount interpretive work the instruments must produce realize this detail advances advances computing power and software for manipulation digital media have dramatically affected the way computer music generated and current generation computers are powerful enough perform very sophisticated audio synthesis using wide variety algorithms and computer music systems and approaches are now and firmly embedded the process creating music that hardly give them second computer based digital and effects units have become commonplace that use digital rather than analog technology create and record music the rather than the citation needed research despite the ubiquity computer music contemporary there considerable activity the field computer researchers continue pursue new and interesting based composition and performance throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated the area computer and electronic music study and including the icma international computer music ircam grame seamus society for electro acoustic music the united cec canadian electroacoustic and great number institutions higher learning around the computer generated music computer generated music music composed with the extensive aid although any music which uses computers its composition realisation generated some the use computers now widespread the editing pop for that the phrase generated music generally used mean kind music which could not have been created without the use citation needed can distinguish two groups generated music which computer generated the which could performed and music which both composed and performed there large genre music that synthesized and created citation needed music composed and performed computers algorithmic composition generative music evolutionary music genetic algorithm composers such gottfried michael koenig had computers generate the sounds the composition well the koenig produced algorithmic composition programs which were generalisation his own serial composition practice this not exactly similar work used mathematical abstractions and examined how far could explore these koenig software translated the calculation mathematical equations into codes which represented musical this could converted into musical notation hand and then performed human his programs project and project are examples this kind later extended the same kind principles into the realm enabling the computer produce the sound ssp example program which performs this kind all these programs were produced koenig the institute sonology utrecht the citation needed procedures such those used koenig and xenakis are still use citation needed since the invention the midi system the early for some people have worked programs which map midi notes algorithm and then can either output sounds music through the sound card write audio file for other programs citation needed some these simple programs are based fractal geometry and can map midi notes specific fractals fractal although such programs are widely available and are sometimes seen clever toys for the some professional musicians have given them attention the resulting can more like can sound quite familiar and with much algorithmic and algorithmic art more depends the way which the parameters are mapped aspects these equations than the equations thus for the same equation can made produce both lyrical and melodic piece music the style the nineteenth and fantastically dissonant cacophony more reminiscent the garde music the and citation needed other programs can map mathematical formulae and constants produce sequences this irrational number can give infinite sequence notes where each note digit the decimal expression that this sequence can turn composition simply the basis for further citation needed operations such and even more elaborate operations can also performed computer music programming languages such max msp supercollider csound pure data keykit and chuck these programs now easily run most personal and are often capable more complex functions than those which would have necessitated the most powerful mainframe computers several decades citation needed there exist programs that generate melodies using vast database one example band box which capable creating jazz blues and rock instrumental solos with almost user another impro visor which uses stochastic free grammar generate phrases and complete citation needed another approach computer composition uses specialized hardware detect external stimuli which are then mapped the computer realize the examples this style computer music can found the work david rokeby very nervous where performer motions are midi computer controlled music also found the performance pieces the canadian composer udo kasemets such the circus elebrating duchamp realization the marcel duchamp process piece erratum musical using electric model train collect car stones deposited drum wired digital mapping the stone impacts score display performed toronto pianist gordon monahan during the duchamp his installations and performance works spectrascapes based his scope channel controlled audio these latter the computer generates scapes from loop sound live shortwave wave citation needed generated scores for performance human players many systems for generating musical scores actually existed well before the time one these was musikalisches rfelspiel musical dice game system which used throws the dice randomly select measures from large collection small when patched these phrases combined create musical pieces which could performed human although these works were not actually composed with computer the modern uses rudimentary form the random combinatorial techniques sometimes used generated citation needed the first digital computer music was generated australia programmer geoff hill the csirac computer which was designed and built trevor pearcey and maston although was only used play standard tunes the subsequently one the first composers write music with computer was iannis xenakis wrote programs the fortran language that generated numeric data that transcribed into scores played traditional musical instruments example although xenakis could well have composed this music the intensity the calculations needed transform probabilistic mathematics into musical notation was best left the crunching power the citation needed computers have also been used attempt imitate the music great composers the such mozart present exponent this technique david cope wrote computer programs that analyse works other composers produce new works similar has used this program great effect with composers such bach and mozart his program experiments musical intelligence famous for creating and also within his own combining his own creations with that the citation needed melomics research group from the university laga spain developed computer composition cluster named iamus which composes multi instrument pieces for editing and since its iamus has composed full album appropriately named iamus which new scientist described the first major work composed computer and performed full the group has also developed api for developers utilize the and makes its music available its computer aided algorithmic composition generative music aided algorithmic composition pronounced the implementation and use algorithmic composition techniques this label derived from the combination two each too vague for continued the label computer aided composition lacks the specificity using generative music produced with notation sequencing software could easily considered aided the label algorithmic composition likewise too particularly that does not specify the use the term computer aided rather than used the same manner computer aided design citation needed machine improvisation machine learning machine listening artificial intelligence neural networks machine improvisation uses computer algorithms create improvisation existing music this usually done sophisticated recombination musical phrases extracted from existing either live order achieve credible improvisation particular machine improvisation uses machine learning and pattern matching algorithms analyze existing musical the resulting patterns are then used create new variations the the original developing notion stylistic this different from other improvisation methods with computers that use algorithmic composition generate new music without performing analysis existing music citation needed statistical style modeling style modeling implies building computational representation the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from statistical approaches are used capture the redundancies terms pattern dictionaries which are later recombined generate new musical style mixing can realized analysis database containing multiple musical examples different machine improvisation builds upon long musical tradition statistical modeling that began with hiller and illiac suite for string quartet and uses markov chains and stochastic processes modern methods include the use lossless data compression for incremental prediction suffix tree and string searching factor oracle algorithm basically factor oracle nite state automaton constructed linear time and space incremental fashion uses machine improvisation machine improvisation encourages musical creativity providing automatic modeling and transformation structures for existing citation needed this creates natural interface with the musician without need for coding musical live the
