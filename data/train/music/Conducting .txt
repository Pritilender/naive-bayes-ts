instrument time with the was common conduct from the harpsichord pieces that had basso continuo part opera there were sometimes two conductors the keyboard player was charge the and the principal violinist leader was charge the the early became the norm have dedicated who did not also play instrument during the the size the usual orchestra expanded during this and the use baton became more was easier see than bare hands among the earliest notable conductors were louis spohr carl maria von weber louis antoine jullien and felix mendelssohn all whom were also mendelssohn claimed have been the first conductor utilize wooden baton keep practice still generally use among prominent conductors who did not not use baton are pierre boulez kurt masur dimitri mitropoulos and leopold stokowski unreliable the composers hector berlioz and richard wagner attained greatness and they wrote two the earliest essays dedicated the berlioz considered the first virtuoso wagner was largely responsible for shaping the role one who imposes his own view piece onto the performance rather than one who just responsible for ensuring entries are made the right time and that there unified predecessors who focused conducting include fran ois habeneck who founded the orchestre des concerts conservatoire though berlioz was later alarmed loose standards wagner time champion hans von low was particularly celebrated although also maintained his initial career instrument which was regarded among the greatest performers was prized piano student franz liszt whose daughter cosima married although she was abandon him for liszt was major figure the history who attained remarkable low raised the technical standards conducting unprecedented level through such innovations detailed rehearsals different sections the orchestra sectional his posts head the bavarian state opera meiningen court orchestra and berlin philharmonic brought level nuance and subtlety orchestral performance previously heard only solo instrumental and doing made profound impression young artists like richard strauss who the age served his and felix weingartner who came disapprove his interpretations but was deeply impressed his orchestral the next generation conductors brought technical standards new perhaps most notable was the born arthur nikisch who succeeded low music director the berlin philharmonic had previously served head the leipzig opera boston symphony orchestra and leipzig gewandhaus orchestra and was serve music director the london symphony orchestra nikisch premiered important works anton bruckner and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky who greatly admired his johannes brahms after hearing him conduct his fourth symphony said was quite impossible hear any nikisch took the london symphony orchestra tour through the united states april the first american tour european also made one the earliest recordings complete the beethoven fifth with the berlin philharmonic november nikisch was also the first conductor have his art captured film alas silently the film confirms reports that made particularly mesmerizing use eye contact and expression communicate with such later conductors fritz reiner stated that this aspect his technique had strong influence their conductors the generations after nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence their two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often somewhat interpretive they were the italian conductor arturo toscanini and the german conductor wilhelm ngler toscanini played orchestras under giuseppe verdi and made his debut conducting aida filling the last minute for indisposed this day regarded such authorities james levine the greatest all verdi but repertory was and was his interpretations the german symphonists beethoven and brahms that was particularly renowned and favoring stricter and faster tempi than conductor like low before wagner still his style shows more inflection than his reputation may and was particularly gifted revealing detail and getting orchestras play singing furtw whom many regard the greatest interpreter wagner although toscanini was also admired this and conducted beethoven and brahms with good deal inflection tempo but generally manner that revealed the structure and direction the music particularly was accomplished composer well and disciple the theorist heinrich schenker who emphasized concern for underlying range harmonic tensions and resolutions strength along with his interest the large furtw ngler also shaped the details the piece particularly compelling and expressive vienna philharmonic the two men had very different toscanini was with large baton and clear beats often not using his left furtw ngler beat time with less apparent because wanted more rounded sound although myth that his technique was many musicians have attested that was easy follow his own any their examples illustrate larger point about conducting technique the first half the was not great and influential conductors the middle century like leopold stokowski otto klemperer herbert von karajan and leonard bernstein incidentally the first american conductor attain greatness and international fame had widely varied karajan and bernstein formed another apparent antipode the karajan music director the berlin philharmonic and bernstein for part that music director the new york philharmonic and later frequent guest conductor karajan technique was highly and eventually conducted with his eyes often bernstein technique was with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body karajan could conduct for hours without moving his while bernstein was known times leap into the air great the music director the berlin karajan cultivated blended beauty which has sometimes been criticized too uniformly only appearance with the berlin philharmonic performing symphony tried get the orchestra produce ugly tone certain passage which believed suited the expressive meaning the music the first horn player and finally agreed let understudy play instead both karajan and bernstein made extensive use advances media convey their but tellingly different bernstein hosted major time national television series educate and reach out children and the public large about classical karajan made series films late his but did not both made numerous but their attitudes toward recording karajan frequently made new studio recordings take advantage advances recording which fascinated him played role setting the specifications the compact disc but his new york came insist for the most live concert believing that making did not come life studio without the last third the conducting technique particularly with the right hand and the baton became increasingly conductors like willem mengelberg amsterdam until the end world war had had extensive rehearsal time mold orchestras very and thus could have idiosyncratic modern who spend less time with any given must get results with much less more standardized technique allows communication much more nonetheless conductors techniques still show great deal particularly with the use the left facial and eye and body through the the ranks major conductors were overwhelmingly male and but going into the that and conductors are coming from increasingly diverse women were almost unheard the ranks leading orchestral conductors through most the and centuries there are accounts orchestras refusing play for them citation needed but artists like marin alsop and simone young have decisively broken the gender the point that gender neutrality conceivable the field and musicians increasingly regard gender alsop was appointed music director the baltimore symphony orchestra the first woman ever appointed head major orchestra and also the orquestra nica estado paulo young scored similar firsts when she became head the hamburg state opera and philharmoniker hamburg she also the first woman

communicating artistic directions performers during although there are many formal rules how conduct others are and wide variety different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication the the primary responsibilities the conductor are unify set the execute clear preparations and listen critically and shape the sound the and control the interpretation and pacing the communication verbal during however rehearsal frequent interruptions allow directions how the music should conducting requires understanding the elements musical expression tempo dynamics articulation and the ability communicate them effectively the ability communicate nuances phrasing and expression through gestures also conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand the conductor while studying the score but may sometimes distinction sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral typically orchestral conductors use baton more often than choral the grip the baton varies from conductor beat and tempo the beat the music typically indicated with the right with without the hand traces shape the air every bar depending the time signature indicating each beat with change from downward upward the images show the most common beat seen from the point the downbeat indicates the first beat the and the upbeat indicates the last beat the the instant which the beat occurs called the ictus ict ictuses and usually indicated sudden though not necessarily click the wrist change baton some ictus also used refer horizontal plane which all the ictuses are physically such the top
