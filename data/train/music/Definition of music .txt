inherently musicians each culture have tended restrict the range sounds they will human organizing element often felt implicit music sounds produced human such waterfalls are often described musical but perhaps less often music the composer murray schafer states that the sound classical music has has swollen with and all this creates musicality that comes before any musicality however the view

time the conventions musical interpretation evolve within different different cultures any given and vary from person person according their experience and further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly considered music experienced nonmusic the mind concentrating other matters and thus not perceiving the essence music clifton specific definitions clifton his book music heard which sets out from the phenomenological position husserl merleau ponty and ric thomas clifton defines music ordered arrangement sounds and silences whose meaning presentative rather than denotative this definition distinguishes end from compositional and from sounds purely physical more music the actualization the possibility any sound whatever present some human being meaning which experiences with his that with his his his his and his clifton therefore certain reciprocal relation established between his and sounding clifton clifton accordingly differentiates music from nonmusic the basis the human behavior rather than either the nature compositional technique sounds purely physical consequently the distinction becomes question what meant musical musically behaving person one whose very being absorbed the significance the sounds being however not altogether accurate say that this person listening the first the person doing more than interpreting judging and second the preposition puts too much stress the sounds thus the musically behaving person experiences musical significance means the clifton this clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from musical meaning and music and nonmusic are distinguished the idea personal the notion personal involvement which lends significance the word ordered this definition clifton this not however sanctification extreme relativism since precisely the aspect experience which lured many writers earlier this century down the path sheer later this trend was reversed renewed interest scientific otherwise nonintrospective musical but have good reason believe that musical experience not purely private like seeing pink elephants and that reporting about such experience need not subjective the sense being mere matter clifton clifton then describe musical experience and the objects this experience together are called and the activity describing phenomena called phenomenology clifton important stress that this definition music says nothing about aesthetic music not fact thing the but meaning constituted human talk about such experience meaningful way demands several first have willing let the composition speak let reveal its own order and second have willing question our assumptions about the nature and role musical last and perhaps most have ready admit that describing meaningful experience itself clifton nattiez often art entertainment total social fact whose definitions vary according era and culture according jean molino often contrasted with noise according
