paleolithic flutes prehistoric music song dynasty night revels han xizai hongzhong the oldest flute ever discovered may fragment the femur juvenile cave bear with two four found divje babe slovenia and dated about years however this has been another flute dated back least years ago was discovered hohle fels cave near ulm germany the holed flute has shaped mouthpiece and made from vulture wing the researchers involved the discovery officially published their findings the journal nature august the discovery was also the oldest confirmed find any musical instrument until redating flutes found gei sterle cave revealed them even older with age years the one several was found the hohle fels cavern next the venus hohle fels and short distance from the oldest known human carving not citation given announcing the scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence established musical tradition the time when modern humans colonized scientists have also suggested that the discovery the flute may help explain the probable behavioural and cognitive gulf neanderthals and early modern human holed made from mammoth tusk from the gei sterle cave near the southern german swabian alb

the chi flutes are mentioned shi jing compiled and edited confucius according the earliest written reference flute from sumerian language cuneiform tablet dated bce flutes are also mentioned recently translated tablet the epic gilgamesh epic poem whose development spanned the period approximately bce additionally set cuneiform tablets knows the musical texts provide precise tuning instructions for seven scale stringed instrument assumed babylonian lyre one those scales named emb bum which akkadian word for flute the bible genesis cites jubal being the father all those who play the ugab and the kinnor the former hebrew term believed some refer some wind wind instruments the latter stringed stringed instruments jubal regarded the christian tradition the inventor the flute word used some translations this biblical elsewhere the the flute referred chalil from the root word for hollow particular samuel kings isaiah and and jeremiah archeological digs the holy land have discovered flutes from both the bronze age bce and the iron age bce the latter era the creation the israelite kingdom and its separation into the two kingdoms israel and some early flutes were made out tibias shin the flute has also always been essential part indian culture and and the cross flute believed several accounts originate india indian literature from bce has made vague references the cross acoustics flute produces sound when stream air directed across hole the instrument creates vibration air the the air stream across this hole creates bernoulli this excites the air contained the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the the player changes the pitch the sound produced opening and closing holes the body the thus changing the effective length the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency varying the air flute player can also change the pitch note causing the air the flute resonate harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening closing any flute must use larger larger air increased air stream velocity volume can generally increased making its resonator and tone holes this why police form very wide for its and why pipe organ can far louder than concert large organ pipe can contain several cubic feet and its tone hole may several inches while concert air stream measures fraction inch the air stream must directed the correct angle and else the air the flute will not fippled ducted precisely formed and placed windway will compress and channel the air the labium ramp edge across the open the pipe this air supplied regulated fipple the air stream shaped and directed the called the embouchure this allows the player wide range expression volume and especially comparison fipple ducted however also makes end blown flute transverse flute considerably more difficult for beginner produce full sound than ducted such the recorder transverse and blown flutes also take more air which requires deeper breathing and makes circular breathing considerably trickier generally the quality called timbre tone varies because the flute can produce harmonics different proportions the tone color can modified changing the internal shape the such the conical the length harmonic frequency that whole number multiple lower fundamental note the generally the air stream thinner vibrating more faster providing more energy excite the and aimed across the hole less deeply permitting more shallow deflection the air the production higher harmonics upper partials head joint geometry appears particularly critical acoustic performance and but there clear consensus particular shape amongst acoustic impedance the embouchure hole appears the most critical critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance chimney length hole between plate and head chimney and radii curvature the ends the chimney and any designed restriction the throat the such that the japanese nohkan flute study which professional players were blindfolded could find significant differences between instruments made from variety different two different sets blind instrument was correctly identified first and only the silver instrument was the study concluded that there was evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect the sound color dynamic range the categories zampo inca pan flute its most basic flute can open tube which blown like there are several broad classes with most the musician blows directly across the edge the with their bottom lip covering the embouchure however some such the whistle gemshorn flageolet recorder tin whistle tonette fujara and ocarina have duct that directs the air onto the edge arrangement that termed fipple these are known fipple flutes the fipple gives the instrument distinct timbre which different from fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier but takes degree control away from the another division between side blown transverse flutes such the western concert piccolo fife dizi and bansuri and end blown flutes such the ney xiao kaval danso shakuhachi anasazi flute and quena the player blown flute uses hole the side the tube produce instead blowing end the end blown flutes should not confused with fipple flutes such the recorder which are also played vertically but have internal duct direct the air flow across the edge the tone flutes may open one both the ocarina xun pan pipes police whistle and bosun whistle are open ended flutes such the concert flute and the recorder have more and thus more flexibility for the and brighter organ pipe may either open depending the sound flutes may have any number pipes though one the most common flutes with multiple resonators may played one resonator time typical with pan more than one time typical with double flutes can played with several different air conventional flutes are blown with the although some cultures use nose flutes the flue pipes organs which are acoustically similar duct are blown bellows western concert flute western concert flute western concert flute the western concert flute descendant the century german flute transverse treble flute that closed the embouchure hole positioned near the across and into which the player the flute has circular tone larger than the finger holes its baroque the size and placement tone the key and the fingering system used produce the notes the range were evolved from theobald boehm and greatly improved the dynamic range and intonation over those its with some refinements and the rare exception the kingma system and other custom adapted fingering western concert flutes typically conform known the boehm system beginner flutes are normally made silver brass that silver while professionals use solid gold and sometimes platinum there are also modern wooden bodies instruments usually with silver gold the wood usually african blackwood the standard concert flute pitched the key and has range three octaves starting from middle one step when foot attached the this means that the concert flute one the highest common orchestra and concert band instruments other sizes modern flutes the piccolo plays octave higher than the regular treble lower members the flute family include the alto and bass flutes that are used and are pitched perfect fourth and octave below the concert respectively parts are written for alto flute more frequently than for citation needed the contrabass double contrabass and hyperbass are other rare forms the flute pitched three and four octaves below middle other sizes flutes and piccolos are used from time rarer instrument the modern pitching system the treble instruments made according older pitch used principally band include piccolo soprano flute the primary equivalent concert alto and bass indian flutes carnatic the bamboo flute important instrument indian classical music and developed independently the western the hindu god lord krishna traditionally considered master the bamboo the indian flutes are very simple compared the western they are made bamboo and are two main varieties indian flutes are currently the the bansuri has six finger holes and one embouchure and used predominantly the hindustani music northern the the venu has eight finger and played predominantly the carnatic music southern presently the holed flute with fingering technique common among many carnatic prior the south indian flute had only seven finger with the fingering standard developed sharaba the palladam the beginning the tamil nadu india the quality the sound depends somewhat the specific bamboo used make and generally agreed that the best bamboo grows the nagercoil area south chinese flutes china there are many varieties dizi chinese with different structures with without resonance and number holes from and intonations different most are made but can come jade bone and one peculiar feature the chinese flute the use resonance membrane mounted one the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the gives the flute bright commonly seen flutes the modern chinese orchestra are the bangdi qudi xindi and dadi the bamboo flute played vertically called the xiao which different category wind instrument japanese flutes the japanese called the fue hiragana encompasses large number musical flutes from both the blown and transverse sodina and suling the sodina blown flute found throughout the island state madagascar located the indian ocean off southeastern one the oldest instruments the bears close resemblance blown flutes found southeast asia and particularly where known the suling suggesting the predecessor the sodina was carried madagascar outrigger canoes the original settlers emigrating from image the most celebrated contemporary sodina rakoto frah was featured the local currency sring
