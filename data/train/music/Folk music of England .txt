attempted elevate folk music through greater compositional and arrangement many progressive folk performers continued retain traditional element their including jansch and who with jacqui mcshee danny thompson and terry cox formed pentangle others totally abandoned the traditional element and this area particularly influential were the scottish artists donovan who was most influenced emerging progressive folk musicians america like bob dylan and the incredible string band who from incorporated range influences including medieval and eastern music into their some particularly the incredible string has been seen developing into the further genre psych psychedelic folk and had considerable impact progressive and psychedelic rock there was brief flowering english progressive folk the late and early with groups like the third ear band and quintessence following the eastern indian musical and more abstract work group such comus dando shaft the trees spirogyra forest and jan dukes grey but commercial success was elusive for these bands and most had broken moved very different directions about perhaps the finest individual work the genre was from artists early artists like nick drake and john martyn but these can also considered the first among the english folk individual performers who remained largely acoustic but who relied mostly their own individual the most successful these was ralph mctell whose streets london reached number the single charts and whose music clearly but without much reliance virtuosity much evidence attempts fusion with other electric folk electric folk electric folk the name given the kind folk rock pioneered england from the late the band fairport convention uses traditional and compositions traditional played combination rock and traditional was most significant the when was taken groups such pentangle steeleye span and the albion band was rapidly adopted and developed the surrounding celtic cultures brittany where was pioneered alan stivell and bands like malicorne ireland groups such horslips and also scotland wales and the isle man and cornwall produce celtic rock and its has been influential those parts the world with close cultural connections such the usa and canada and gave rise the genre medieval folk rock and the fusion genres folk punk and folk metal the the genre was steep decline but has survived and revived significance part more general folk resurgence since the folk punk folk punk the new rebirth english folk this time fusing folk with energy and political aggression derived from punk leaders included the pogues the men they hang oyster band and billy bragg folk dance music also became popular the with acts like the english country blues band and tiger the decade later saw the use reggae with english folk

folk and jig style leading them credited the pioneers folk which has spread the baltic and traditional folk resurgence present the peak traditional english like progressive and electric was the when for time threatened break through into the the end the however was the attendance and numbers folk clubs began probably new musical and social including punk rock new wave and electronic music began although many acts like martin carthy and the watersons continued perform there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms the this began change with new generation the the arrival and sometimes mainstream success acts like kate rusby nancy kerr kathryn tickell jim moray spiers and boden seth lakeman frank turner and eliza carthy all largely concerned with acoustic performance traditional marked radical turn around the fortunes the this was reflected the adoption creation the bbc radio folk awards which gave the music much needed status and focus and the profile folk music high england today has been for over thirty folk clubs folk clubs although there were handful clubs that allowed space for the performance traditional folk music the early its major boost came from the lived british skiffle craze from about new clubs included the ballad and club pub soho founded ewan the craze subsided from the many these clubs began shift towards the performance english traditional folk many became strict policy that pursued pure and traditional form the there were probably over most clubs were simply regular usually the back upstairs room public house weekly they were largely phenomenon the urbanised middle classes and known for the amateur nature many there were also who performed regular short sets many these later emerged major performers their own including lloyd martin carthy and shirley collins later generation performers used the folk club circuit for highly successful mainstream including billy connolly jasper carrott ian dury and barbara dickson the number clubs began decline the the face changing musical and social but the decline began stabilize the with the resurgence interest folk music and there are now over folk clubs the united including many that can trace their origins back the folk music and the radio the difficulty gaining regular appearances television england has long meant that radio has remained the major popular medium for increasing awareness the the efdss sponsored the bbc home service radio roved out based field recordings made peter kennedy and amus ennis from which probably did more than any other single factor introduce the general population british folk music the also important were occasional radio such ballads and blues maccoll radio ballads and the song carriers john peel frequently included

the and there are over hundred folk festivals varying sizes held england every forms folk music ballads ballads ballad form often narrative story and set many ballads were written and sold single sheet broadsides they are usually narrative structure and make considerable use the traditional ballad has been seen originating with the wandering minstrels late medieval there have been many different and contradictory attempts classify traditional ballads but commonly identified types are supernatural tragic love historic legends and carols carols carol festive modern times recognised being exclusively associated with but reality there are carols celebrating all festivals and seasons the year and not necessarily christian they were derived from form circle dance accompanied which was popular from the from the century they were used processional particularly easter and and accompany religious mystery plays they declined after the protestant reformation which banned many religious but some famous carols were written this including the holly and the ivy and they were more strongly revived from the century and began written and adapted eminent children songs children songs little pretty pocket book the earliest vernacular songs europe are lullabies from the later medieval from soon after have records short rhyming but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the the first english collections were tommy song book and tommy pretty song book are both thought have been published before and john newbery mother sonnets for the cradle the first record have many classic these rhymes seem have come from variety including traditional riddles proverbs ballads lines mummers plays drinking historical and has been ancient pagan roughly half the current body recognised english rhymes were known the from this period sometimes know the origins and authors like twinkle twinkle little star which combined century french tune with poem english writer jane taylor and mary had little lamb written sarah josepha hale boston the and possibly the most important collection focus this area james orchard halliwell the nursery rhymes england and popular rhymes and tales the height the revival sabine gould produced book nursery songs and andrew lang produced the nursery rhyme book children unlike folk have remained part living and continuous for although added from other sources and affected written most adults pass songs they learned from oral sources erotic folk songs has been noted most recent commentators english folk that the erotic and even the were major traditional themes more than ballads are may have been the largest groups printed many collectors the first revival either ignored such bowdlerized them for francis child and cecil sharp did their the second erotic folk song was much more accepted part the canon traditional helped the publication books such gershon the horn studies erotic folklore and the erotic american bawdy songs which printed many previously unpublished songs england lloyd was the key figure introducing erotic songs the lecturing and publishing the recorded the foggy dew and other traditional english love songs and then the bird the traditional erotic songs with frankie armstrong and anne briggs drew distinction between erotic those that dealt with love and suggested sexuality through innuendo like the bonny black and the bird the and pornographic songs that were explicit and therefore unworthy some however find these distinctions more difficult although erotic songs became part the standard fare folk clubs and among electric folk relatively few the more explicit songs have been placed hornpipes hornpipe the hornpipe style dance music thought have taken its name from english reed instrument least the the century changed from time assuming its modern and probably reaching the height its popularity became staple theatrical most often associated with the sailor hornpipe but has formed the basis many individual and group country dances into the modern like many dances was taken scotland and ireland and given distinctive national character and moved america with jigs jigs jigs are style

usually accompanied and based rhythmic stepping and the execution choreographed figures group often using implements such swords and the name thought derive from the term moorish for spanish styles dance and may derive from english court dances the references have been found that suggest that morris dance dates back the but claims christian origins are now largely morris dance appears have been widespread england the early particularly pastoral but was along with associated festivals during and after the english civil war recovered after the restoration but was steep decline after agricultural and industrial revolutions the when collectors like cecil sharp recorded the particularly from versions dance found the cotswolds this led revival the although may also have affected form and morris dance took something back seat unaccompanied singing the second but received further boost when attracted the attention electric folk musicians like ashley who produced several albums dance including the influential morris series from traditionally morris dance was accompanied either pipe and tabor fiddle but from the century most common instruments were the melodeon accordion concertina and drums particularly cotswold and border many tunes are linked particular morris dance survives the distinct local traditions cotswold north west border morris rapper dance and long sword dance protest songs protest songs early protest songs from britain perhaps the oldest clear example english protest song the rhyme when adam delved and eve who was then the used the peasants revolt songs that celebrated social bandits like robin hood from the century onwards can seen more subtle form with the levellers and diggers the more overt criticism the ballad the diggers song from roughly the same songs protest pointing out the costs human also begin like the maunding souldier the fruits warre framed begging appeal from crippled soldier the thirty years war with industrialisation from the surprising english folk hero immortalised song napoleon songs such the bonny bunch and labour became more organised songs were used anthems and for miners with songs like the black leg and for factory workers with songs like the factory these industrial protest songs were largely ignored during the first english folk revival the later and early but were recorded figures like lloyd albums such the iron muse the the anarchist rock band chumbawamba recorded several versions traditional english protest english rebel songs ewan maccoll became the leading writer english protest songs the with communist songs such the ballad chi minh and the ballad stalin well volatile protest and topical songs concerning the nuclear threat most notably against the atom the leading voice protest thatcherite britain the was billy bragg whose style protest song and roots political activism was mostly reminiscent those woody guthrie sea shanties sea shanties sea shanties are type work song traditionally sung derived from the french word meaning they may date from early the but most recorded examples derive from the shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed help with collective tasks intensive sailing and later steam many were call and response songs with one voice the singing lead line and the rest the sailors giving response there were derived from varied including folk polkas waltzes and even west african since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main short haul for tasks requiring quick pulls over relatively short halyard for heavier work requiring more time between and capstan shanties for repetitive tasks requiring sustained but not involving working the famous shanties the drunken sailor and blow the man down there was some interest sea shanties the first revival from figures like percy the second revival lloyd attempted popularise recording several albums sea songs from war songs war songs england songs about military and naval subjects were major part the output ballad writers from the century including one the earliest british ballads the ballad chevy chase which deals with the events the scottish victory the battle otterburn and may date the early the conflicts between england and spain the later and early centuries produced number ballads describing particularly naval conflicts like those the spanish armada the english civil war produced genre cavalier ballads including when the king home peace many these were adapted and reused jacobites after the glorious revolution the french wars the and centuries saw more descriptive usually couched patriotic but like captain dealt with loss and regimental identities emerged songs were adopted for like the british grenadiers based century dance output became flood during the revolutionary and napoleonic wars seeing numerous patriotic war like heart oak and the emergence stereotype the english seaman jolly jack tar who appeared many ballads and the musical hall began take over the lead popular music and folk song folk song ceased deal with contemporary wars the later citation needed work songs work songs work songs include music sung while conducting task often coordinate song linked task trade which might connected narrative description protest song the two main types work song england are agricultural work usually are rhythmic cappella songs sung people working physical and often repetitive like the harvest common west the songs were probably intended increase productivity while reducing feelings rhythms work songs can serve synchronize physical movement group industrial folk song emerged britain the workers took the music with which they were including ballads and agricultural work and adapted them their new experiences and unlike agricultural work was often unnecessary use music synchronise actions between the pace would increasingly determined steam chemical and eventually electric and frequently impossible because the noise early industrial folk songs tended descriptive circumstances political making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts leisure rather than during this pattern can seen textile production mining and eventually shipbuilding rail working and other regional traditions east anglia whittlesea straw bear despite enjoying relative geographical uniformity and history east anglia often seen the region england with the weakest attachment regional least outside the historical kingdom east like many regions england there are few distinctive local instruments and many songs were shared with the rest britain and with although the distinct dialects the regions sometimes lent them particular stamp with one the longest coastlines any english songs about the sea were also particularly along with the west this was one the regions that most firmly adopted reed producing many eminent practitioners the melodeon from the also like the west country one the few regions where there still active tradition step dancing and like the midlands the tradition molly dance died out the the region was relatively neglected folk song collectors the first lucy broadwood and cecil sharp collected did and vaughan williams well norfolk and essex from but most important regional figure was composer ernest john moeran who collected over songs norfolk

nesling suffolk singer and bargeman bob roberts many whom recorded for topic records perhaps the most influential folk dance musical album was english country dance music put together reg hall and bob davenport with largely norfolk was the first instrumental recording folk also from norfolk was peter bellamy who solo with the young tradition and theatrical productions was probably one the most influential musicians the post revival the norfolk melodeon player and singer tony hall has given the tradition unique east anglia made contribution the electric folk scene the producing the but more recently bands midwinter and stone based great yarmouth and the more successful spriguns tolgus from who produced four the most successful folk artists from the region recent years are probably the essex born billy bragg and the norfolk born beth orton the region home numerous folk clubs and hosts many folk including steeleye spanfest kentwell hall suffolk and the cambridge folk festival generally seen the most prestigious the since the east anglian traditional music trust has been promoting folk music the organising traditional music every year the midlands due its lack clear boundaries and perceived lack identity its folk the english midlands attracted relatively little interest the early however more recent years distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and many associated with the regions industrial has also produced number important performers and some particular local such the lincolnshire bagpipes however the last john died the century and actual examples the pipes have from the century the instruments used appear have been much like those other with accordions and eventually silver and although some like molly dance died out the the midlands retained strong traditions both ceremonial and social particularly the south midlands and cotswolds and the distinctive border morris from worcestershire and the region also furnished some important material for folk including claim nottinghamshire for one the most popular series that robin hood while local places appear songs such the leicester and worcester folk song

potteries began gain serious despite this neglect there was active folk scene the which produced several key artists the second revival from the including anne briggs from the settlers from the west midlands and from birmingham one the most influential groups the the ian campbell folk which numbered among its members later electric folk musicians dave swarbrick and dave pegg slightly later number
