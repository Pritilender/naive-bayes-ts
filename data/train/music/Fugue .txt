imitation repetition different and recurs frequently the course the the english term fugue originated the century and derived from the french word fugue the italian fuga this turn comes from also fuga which itself related both fugere and fugare the adjectival form fugal variants include fughetta small and fugato passage fugal style within another work that not fugue usually has three and recapitulation containing the return the subject the tonic key though not all fugues have the middle ages the term was widely used denote any works canonic style the renaissance had come denote specifically imitative since the the term fugue has described what commonly regarded the most fully developed procedure imitative most fugues open with short main the subject which then sounds successively each voice after the first voice finished stating the second voice repeats the subject different and other voices repeat the same when each voice has the exposition this often followed connecting episode developed from previously heard further entries the subject then are heard related episodes and entries are usually alternated until the final the which point the music has returned the opening which often followed closing the coda this fugue style rather than fixed the form evolved during the century from several earlier types contrapuntal such imitative ricercars capriccios canzonas and fantasias the famous fugue composer johann sebastian bach shaped his own works after those johann jakob froberger johann pachelbel girolamo frescobaldi dieterich buxtehude and with the

written according certain predefined later portions the composer has more though logical key structure usually further entries the subject will occur throughout the repeating the accompanying material the same the various entries may may not separated episodes what follows chart displaying fairly typical fugal and explanation the processes involved creating this the exposition exposition fugue begins with the exposition its subject one the voices alone the tonic key after the statement the second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed another often closely key which known the answer make the music run may also have altered when the answer exact copy the subject the classified real answer has altered any way tonal answer bach fugue bwv well tempered clavier listen tonal answer usually called for when the subject begins with prominent dominant where there prominent dominant note very close the beginning the prevent undermining the sense key this note transposed fourth the tonic rather than fifth the answers the subdominant are also employed for the same while the answer being the voice which the subject was previously heard continues with new this new material reused later statements the called countersubject this accompanying material only heard simply referred free counterpoint the countersubject written invertible counterpoint the octave the distinction made between the use free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue because order for countersubject heard accompanying the subject more than one must capable sounding correctly above below the and must therefore invertible double counterpoint tonal music invertible contrapuntal lines must written according certain rules because several intervallic while acceptable one particular are longer permissible when for when the note sounds one voice above the note lower the interval fifth which considered consonant and entirely when this interval inverted the upper voice above the forms considered dissonance tonal contrapuntal and requires special preparation and the sounding the same time the transposed the pitch the each voice then responds with its own subject and further countersubjects free counterpoint may when tonal answer customary for the exposition alternate subjects with answers however some fugues this order occasionally see the saas arrangement fugue bwv from the well tempered book bach brief codetta often heard connecting the various statements the subject and this allows the music run the just the other parts the can used throughout the rest the the first answer must occur soon after the initial statement the subject therefore the first codetta often extremely not the above example this the the subject finishes the quarter note flat the third beat the second bar which harmonizes the opening the the later codettas may considerably and often serve develop the material heard far the answer and countersubject and possibly introduce ideas heard the second countersubject free counterpoint that follows delay and therefore heighten the impact the reentry the subject another voice well modulating back the the exposition usually concludes when all voices have given statement the subject some the exposition will end with redundant extra presentation the furthermore some fugues the entry one the voices may reserved until for example the pedals organ fugue see bach fugue major for bwv the episode section further entries the subject follow this initial either immediately for example fugue bwv the well tempered clavier separated episodes episodic material always modulatory and usually based upon some element heard the each episode has primarily the function transitioning for the next entry the subject new and may also provide release from the strictness form employed the and dalge states that the episode the fugue generally based series imitations the subject that have been the development musical development further entries the middle occur throughout the they must state the subject answer least once its and may also heard combination with the from the new free any these uncommon for the subject enter alone single voice the entries the rather usually heard with least one the countersubjects other free contrapuntal middle entries tend occur pitches other than the shown the typical structure these are often closely related keys such the relative dominant and although the key structure fugues varies the fugues bach the first entry occurs most often the relative major minor the overall and followed entry the dominant the relative major minor when the subject requires tonal the fugues earlier composers notably buxtehude and pachelbel middle entries keys other than the tonic and dominant tend the and modulation the one the famous examples such modulating fugue occurs praeludium fugue and buxwv when there entrance the subject and answer the composer can develop the subject altering the subject this called often inversion although the term sometimes used synonymously with entry and may also describe the exposition completely new double fugue for example see any the entries within fugue the subject may inversion retrograde less common form where the entire subject heard and diminution the reduction the rhythmic values certain augmentation the increase the rhythmic values certain any combination example and analysis the excerpt bars bach fugue bwv from the well tempered clavier book illustrates the application most the characteristics described the fugue for keyboard and three with regular this excerpt opens last entry the the subject sounding the the first countersubject the while the voice stating second version the second which concludes with the characteristic rhythm the and always used together with the first version the second following this episode modulates from the tonic the relative major means the form accompanied canon the arrival flat major marked quasi perfect cadence across the from the last quarter note beat the first bar the first beat the second bar the second and the first middle here bach has altered countersubject accommodate the change bach tempered clavier book listen false entries any point the fugue there may false entries the which include the start the subject but are not false entries are often abbreviated the head the and anticipate the true entry the heightening the impact the subject bach tempered clavier book quarter note exposition the exposition second however there are only two and the entries occur reverse the exposition fugue separated from the exposition and the same key the original stretto sometimes expositions the middle entries take place stretto whereby one voice responds with the answer before the first voice has completed its entry the usually increasing the intensity the johann caspar ferdinand fischer listen help info only one entry the subject must heard its completion however stretto which the answer heard completion all voices known stretto maestrale grand stretto strettos may also occur augmentation and fugue which the opening exposition takes place stretto form known close fugue stretto fugue see for the gratias agimus tibi and dona nobis pacem choruses from mass minor final entries and coda the closing section fugue often includes one two and possibly the tonic sometimes over tonic dominant pedal note any material that follows the final entry the subject considered the final coda and normally cadential types fugue double quadruple fugue double fugue has two subjects that are often developed similarly follows that triple fugue has three there are two kinds double fugue which the second subject presented simultaneously with the subject the exposition kyrie eleison mozart requiem minor and fugue which the second subject has its own exposition some later and the two subjects are not combined until later see for fugue sharp minor from well tempered clavier book more bach anne fugue flat bwv triple fugue for counter fugue fugue fugue which the first answer presented the subject inversion and the inverted subject continues feature prominently throughout the examples include contrapunctus through contrapunctus vii from the art fugue permutation fugue permutation fugue describes type composition technique which elements fugue and strict canon are each voice enters succession with the each entry alternating between tonic and and each having stated the initial continues stating two more themes which must conceived correct invertible each voice takes this pattern and states all the themes the same order and repeats the material when all the themes have been sometimes after there usually very little thematic during the course permutation quite actually for every single possible combination permutation the themes this limitation exists consequence sheer the more voices the greater the amount possible composers exercise editorial judgment the most musical permutations and processes leading one example permutation fugue can seen the opening chorus himmelsk sei willkommen bwv permutation fugues differ from conventional fugue that there are connecting nor statement the themes related the fugue passacaglia and fugue bwv unusual this since does have episodes between permutation invertible counterpoint one the main technical devices used permutation fugue not the conventional fughetta fughetta short fugue that has the same characteristics often the contrapuntal writing not and the setting less see for variation diabelli history middle ages and renaissance period the term fuga was used far back the middle but was initially used refer any kind imitative including canons which are now thought distinct from prior the fugue was originally was not until the century that fugal technique understood today began seen both instrumental and fugal writing found works such fantasias ricercares and canzonas fugue theoretical term first occurred when jacobus liege wrote about the fuga his speculum musicae the fugue arose from the technique imitation where the same musical material was repeated starting different gioseffo zarlino author and theorist the was one the first distinguish between the two types imitative fugues and canons which called originally this was aid improvisation but the was considered technique the renaissance composer giovanni pierluigi palestrina wrote masses using modal counterpoint and and fugal writing became the basis for writing motets palestrina imitative motets differed from fugues that each phrase the text had different subject which was introduced and worked out whereas fugue continued working with the same subject subjects throughout the entire length the baroque era was the baroque period that the writing fugues became central part demonstration compositional fugues were incorporated into variety musical jan pieterszoon sweelinck girolamo frescobaldi johann jakob froberger and dieterich buxtehude all wrote and george frideric handel included them many his oratorios keyboard suites from this time often conclude with fugal gigue domenico scarlatti has only few fugues among his corpus over harpsichord the french overture featured quick fugal section after slow the second movement sonata chiesa written arcangelo corelli and was usually the baroque period also saw rise the importance music theory some fugues during the baroque period were pieces designed teach contrapuntal technique the most influential text was published johann joseph fux his gradus parnassum steps parnassus which appeared this work laid out the terms species and offered series exercises learn fugue fux work was largely based the practice palestrina modal mozart studied from this and remained influential into the nineteenth haydn for taught counterpoint from his own summary and thought the basis for formal this musical form was also apparent chamber music bach would later compose for the famous concerto for two violins minor bwv although not contrapuntal its has fugal opening section its first citation needed most famous fugues are those for the harpsichord the tempered clavier which many composers and theorists look the greatest model the tempered clavier comprises two volumes written different times each comprising prelude and fugue one for each major and minor bach also known for his organ which are usually preceded prelude toccata the art fugue collection fugues and four canons single theme that gradually transformed the cycle bach also wrote smaller single and put fugues into many his works that were not fugues per bach influence extended forward through his son bach and through the theorist friedrich wilhelm marpurg whose abhandlung von der fuge treatise the was largely based bach classical era during the classical the fugue was longer central even fully natural mode musical nevertheless both haydn and mozart had periods their careers which they some sense rediscovered fugal writing and used frequently their haydn was the leader fugal composition and technique the classical haydn most famous fugues can found his sun quartets which three have fugal this was practice that haydn repeated only once later his writing with the finale his quartet some the earliest examples use however are three symphonies and that date from the earliest both the symphonies and the baryton exhibit the influence joseph treatise gradus parnassum which haydn studied haydn second fugal period occurred after and was greatly inspired the oratorios handel during his visits london haydn then studied techniques and incorporated handelian fugal writing into the choruses his mature oratorios the creation and the seasons well several his later including and wolfgang amadeus mozart studied counterpoint when young with padre martini however the major impetus fugal writing for mozart was the influence baron gottfried van swieten vienna around van during diplomatic service berlin had taken the opportunity collect many manuscripts bach and handel and invited mozart study his collection and also encouraged him transcribe various works for other combinations mozart was evidently fascinated these and wrote set transcriptions for string trio fugues from well tempered clavier introducing them with preludes his mozart then set writing fugues his mimicking the baroque these included the fugues for string and fugue minor for two pianos later mozart incorporated fugal writing into the finale his symphony and his opera die the parts the requiem completed also contain several fugues most notably the and the three fugues the domine also left behind sketch for amen fugue some would have come the end the ludwig van beethoven was familiar with fugal writing from important part his training was playing from the tempered clavier during his early career vienna beethoven attracted notice for his performance these there are fugal sections early piano and fugal writing found the second and fourth movements the eroica symphony beethoven incorporated fugues his and reshaped the purpose and compositional technique for later generations nevertheless fugues did not take truly central role work until his late dissonant fugue forms the finale his string the latter was later published separately the gro fuge great the finale hammerklavier sonata contains which was practically unperformed until the late due its tremendous technical difficulty and furthermore the last movement his cello and the whole work contains fugal vague fugal passages are also found the missa solemnis and all movements the ninth symphony except the third romantic era the beginning the romantic era fugue writing had become specifically attached the norms and styles the verdi who included whimsical example the end his opera falstaff bruckner and mahler also included them their respective academic fugue presented symbolize the sophistication science also sprach zarathustra citation needed century twentieth century composers brought fugue back its position realizing its uses full instrumental its importance development and introductory and the developmental capabilities fugal igor stravinsky also incorporated fugues into his including the symphony psalms and the dumbarton oaks concerto stravinsky recognized the compositional techniques and the second movement his symphony psalms lays out fugue that much like that the baroque employs double fugue with two distinct the first beginning and the second techniques such sequencing and the use subject incipits are frequently heard the olivier messiaen writing about his vingt regards sur enfant wrote the sixth piece that par lui tout fait him were all things expresses the creation all space time stars planets and the countenance the god behind the flames and the seething impossible even speak have not attempted describe instead have sheltered behind the form the bach art fugue and the fugue from opus the hammerklavier sonata have nothing with the academic like those great this one scholastic rgy ligeti wrote part double fugue for his second the kyrie which each part subdivided voice bundless that make canon the melodic material this fugue totally with melismatic parts overlaid onto skipping and use polyrhythm multiple simultaneous subdivisions the blurring everything both harmonically and rhythmically create aural thus highlighting the aesthetic question the next section whether fugue form the third movement george gershwin catfish row suite atonal citation needed canadian pianist and musical thinker glenn gould composed you want write scale fugue set text that cleverly explicates its own musical musical form widespread view the fugue that not musical form the sense say sonata form but rather technique the austrian musicologist erwin ratz argues that the formal organization fugue involves not only the arrangement its theme and but also its harmonic the exposition and coda tend emphasize the tonic key whereas the episodes usually explore more distant ratz however that this the underlying form urform the from which individual fugues may thus noted that while certain related keys are more commonly explored fugal the overall structure fugue does not limit its harmonic for fugue may not even explore the one the most closely related keys the bach fugue major from book one the well tempered clavier explores the relative minor the supertonic and the subdominant this unlike later forms such the which clearly prescribes which keys are explored typically the tonic and dominant aba then many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding and either use serial rules the kyrie christe rgy ligeti requiem witold awski works use panchromatic even denser harmonic perceptions and aesthetics fugue the most complex contrapuntal fugal technique significantly burdens the shaping musical and was given only the greatest such bach and breathe life into such unwieldy form and make the bearer the highest presenting fugues among the greatest contrapuntal peter kivy points out that counterpoint since time out has been associated the thinking musicians with the profound and the and argues that there seems some rational justification for their doing this related the idea that restrictions create freedom for the directing their also points out that fugue writing has its roots and during the practiced improvisatory writing nicola vicentino for suggests the having completed the initial imitative take the passage which has served accompaniment the theme and make the basis for new imitative that will always have material with which compose without having stop and this formulation the basic rule for fugal improvisation anticipates later century discussions which deal with the improvisational technique the keyboard more
