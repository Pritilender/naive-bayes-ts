turns playing the while others improvised countermelodies the swing era big bands were coming rely more arranged arrangements were either written learned ear and while individual soloists would

such modal jazz abandoned the strict notion chord progression allowing the individual musicians improvise even more freely within the context given scale many forms jazz soloist often supported rhythm
