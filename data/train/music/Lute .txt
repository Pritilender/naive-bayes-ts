nylon offers greater tuning but seen anachronistic its timbre differs from the sound earlier gut such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are note are the catlines used basses historical catlines are several gut strings wound together and soaked heavy metal solutions increase the string catlines can quite large diameter compared wound nylon strings the same they produce bass that differs somewhat timbre from nylon the strings are arranged courses two strings though the pitched course usually consists only single called the chanterelle later baroque lutes two upper courses are the courses are numbered counting from the highest that the chanterelle the first course the next pair strings the second course etc thus course renaissance lute usually has strings and course baroque lute has the courses are tuned unison for high and intermediate but for lower pitches one the two strings tuned octave higher the course where this split starts changed over the history the the two strings course are virtually always stopped and plucked single but rare piece requires that the two strings course stopped plucked the tuning lute complicated described section its own below the design makes extremely light for its history and evolution the lute lyre ancient egyptian dynasty the origins the lute are and organologists disagree about the very definition the highly influential organologist curt sachs distinguished between the necked and the necked both referred chordophones with neck distinguished from harps and psalteries smith and others argue the necked variety should not called lute all because existed for least millennium before the appearance the necked instrument that eventually evolved into what now known the the necked variety also was never called lute before the twentieth various types necked chordophones were use ancient greek egyptian the middle kingdom iranian elamite and hittite roman bulgar turkic indian chinese armenian cilician cultures the lute developed its familiar forms barbat persia armenia and byzantium beginning the early seventh these instruments often had bodies covered with animal and unknown exactly when became replaced with wooden early the sixth the bulgars brought the necked variety the instrument called komuz the the ninth moors also brought the oud the necked pandura had previously been quite common variety the lute the the quitra did not become however but continued its besides the still surviving kuitra algiers and its descendants include the chitarra italiana chitarrone and colascione from

there were several and the end the seven different sizes the great octave are song accompaniment was probably the primary function the middle but very little music securely attributable the lute survives from the era before medieval and renaissance song accompaniments were probably mostly hence the lack written the last few decades the fifteenth play renaissance polyphony single lutenists gradually abandoned the quill favor plucking the instrument with the the number courses grew six and the lute was the premier solo instrument the sixteenth but continued accompany singers the end the renaissance the number courses had grown and during the baroque era the number continued grow until reached and occasionally many these with strings required innovations the structure the the end the evolution the archlute theorbo and torban had long extensions attached the main tuning head provide greater resonating length for the bass and since human fingers are not long enough stop strings across neck wide enough hold courses the bass strings were placed outside the and were played open without pressing them against the fingerboard with the left over the course the baroque era the lute was increasingly relegated the continuo accompaniment and was eventually superseded that role keyboard the lute almost fell out use after some sorts lute were still used for some time sweden ukraine

the most employment and new compositions for the instrument are being produced renaissance during the early days the early music many lutes were constructed available whose specialty was often classical such lutes were heavily built with construction similar classical with fan heavy fixed and lined all which are anachronistic historical lutherie scholarship makers began constructing instruments based historical which have proven lighter and more responsive lutes built present are invariably replicas near copies those surviving historical instruments that are museums private they are exclusively built must bought second hand very limited lutes are generally more expensive than produced modern instruments such the though not nearly expensive the unlike the past there are many

however the earliest surviving lute music dates from the late lute music flourished during the and numerous composers published collections their and modern scholars have uncovered vast number manuscripts from the much the music still the second half the century vihuelas and similar instruments started losing and almost music had been written for the instrument after the interest lute music was revived only the second half the improvisation apparently important aspect lute much the repertoire was probably never written furthermore was only around that lute players began transition from plectrum that change facilitated complex which required that they develop the next hundred three schools tablature notation gradually italian also used german and only the last survived into the late the earliest known tablatures are for stringed though evidence earlier and stringed lutes tablature notation depends the actual instrument the music written read musician must know the number etc renaissance and baroque forms lute music are similar keyboard music the intabulations vocal works were very well various some which disappeared during the such the piva and the saltarello the advent polyphony brought about fantasias complex intricate pieces with much use imitative the improvisatory present some degree most lute particularly evident the early ricercares not imitative their later but completely well numerous preludial preludes tastar corde testing the etc during the century keyboard and lute music went hand and lutenists were writing suites dances quite akin those keyboard the lute was also used throughout its history ensemble most frequently songs for voice and which were particularly popular italy see frottola and the earliest surviving lute music from late century the early century saw petrucci publications lute music francesco spinacino and joan ambrosio dalza together with the called capirola lutebook these represent the earliest stage written lute music the leader the next generation italian francesco canova milano now acknowledged one the most famous lute composers the bigger part his output consists pieces called fantasias which makes extensive use imitation and expanding the scope lute the early century johannes hieronymus kapsberger and alessandro piccinini revolutionized the technique and possibly influenced the keyboard music frescobaldi french written lute music far with pierre attaingnant prints which comprised dances and particularly important was the italian composer albert rippe who worked france and composed polyphonic fantasias considerable his work was published posthumously his guillaume morlaye born who however did not pick the complex polyphony french lute music declined during the second part the however various changes the instrument the increase diapason new etc prompted important change style that during the early the celebrated style broken arpeggiated textures that influenced johann jakob froberger the french baroque school exemplified composers such ennemond gaultier denis gaultier fran ois dufaut before before and many the last stage french lute music exemplified robert whose suites exploit the possibilities the the history german written lute music started with arnolt schlick after who published collection pieces that included voice and lute and three solo lute alongside organ was not the first important german because contemporaries credited conrad paumann with the invention german lute though this claim remains and lute works paumann after string composers developed german lute hans nig the neusidler family particularly hans neusidler and during the second half the german tablature and german repertoire were gradually replaced italian and french tablature and international respectively and the thirty years war effectively stopped publications for half german lute music was revived much later composers such esaias reusner however distinctly german style came only after the works silvius leopold weiss one the greatest lute some whose works were transcribed for keyboard none other than johann sebastian bach who composed few pieces for the lute himself though unclear whether they were really intended for the rather than another plucked string instrument the lautenwerk other european particularly important are england and english written lute music only began around however the country produced numerous which john dowland perhaps the most his influence spread very variations his themes were written keyboard composers germany decades after his dowland predecessors and such anthony holborne and daniel bacheler were less spanish composers wrote mostly for the vihuela their main genres were polyphonic fantasias and differencias luys milan after and luys were particularly important for their contributions the development lute polyphony finally perhaps the most influential european lute composer was the hungarian lint bakfark whose contrapuntal fantasias were much more difficult and tighter than those his western european lute revival and composers the revival playing the century has its roots the pioneering work arnold dolmetsch whose research into early music and instruments started the movement for the revival the lute gave composers opportunity create new works for one the first such composers was johann nepomuk david composer

vihuela pochette lutes were made large variety with varying numbers and with permanent standard for however the following seems have been generally true the renaissance course renaissance tenor lute would tuned the same intervals tenor viol with intervals perfect fourth between all the courses except the and which differed only major third the tenor lute was usually tuned nominally there was pitch standard before the named after the pitch the highest yielding the pattern from the lowest course the much renaissance lute music can played guitar tuning the third string down half for lutes with more than six courses the extra courses would added the low because the large number lutes have very wide and difficult stop strings beyond the sixth additional courses were usually tuned pitches useful bass notes rather than continuing the regular pattern and these lower courses are most often played without thus course tenor renaissance lute would tuned and course however none these patterns were rigueur and modern lutenist occasionally retunes one more courses between manuscripts bear instructions for the choeur seventh course the standard the first part the seventeenth century was
