nova organum motet madrigal canon ballata medieval music was both sacred and secular during the earlier medieval period the liturgical genre predominantly gregorian chant was monophonic polyphonic genres began develop during the high medieval era becoming prevalent the later and early the development such forms often associated with the ars nova the earliest innovations upon monophonic plainchant were heterophonic the organum for expanded upon plainchant melody using accompanying sung fixed interval with resulting alternation between polyphony and the principles the organum date back anonymous century the musica enchiriadis which established the tradition duplicating preexisting plainchant parallel motion the interval fifth greater sophistication was the motet which developed from the clausula genre medieval plainchant and would become the most popular form medieval while early motets were liturgical the end the thirteenth century the genre had expanded include secular such courtly love during the renaissance the italian secular genre the madrigal also became similar the polyphonic character the madrigals featured greater fluidity and motion the leading the madrigal form also gave rise canons especially italy where they were composed under the title caccia these were part secular which featured the two higher voices with underlying instrumental note finally purely instrumental music also developed during this both the context growing theatrical tradition and for court consumption dance often improvised around familiar was the largest purely instrumental the secular ballata which became very popular trecento italy had its for medieval instrumental dance theory and notation during the medieval period the foundation was laid for the notational and theoretical practices that would shape western music into what the most obvious these the development comprehensive notational however the theoretical particularly regard rhythm and are equally important the development western notation the earliest medieval music did not have any kind notational the tunes were primarily monophonic and transmitted oral however this form notation only served memory aid for singer who already knew the also rome tried centralize the various liturgies and establish the roman rite the primary tradition the need transmit these chant ideas across vast distances effectively was equally the first step fix this problem came with the introduction various signs written above the chant called neumes the origin neumes unclear and subject some however most scholars agree that their closest ancestors are the classic greek and roman grammatical signs that indicated important points declamation recording the rise and fall the the two basic signs the classical grammarians were the acutus indicating raising the and the gravis indicating these eventually evolved into the basic symbols for neumatic notation the virga rod which indicates higher note and still looked like the acutus from which and the punctum dot which indicates lower note the name reduced the gravis symbol these the acutus and the gravis could combined represent graphical vocal inflections the syllable this kind notation seems have developed earlier than the eighth but the ninth was firmly established the primary method musical the basic notation the virga and the punctum remained the symbols for individual but other neumes soon developed which showed several notes joined these new neumes called are essentially combinations the two original this basic neumatic notation could only specify the number notes and whether they moved there was way indicate exact any even the starting these limitations are further indication that the neumes were developed tools support the practice oral rather than supplant however even though started mere memory the worth having more specific notation soon became the next development musical notation was heighted neumes which neumes were carefully placed different heights relation each this allowed the neumes give rough indication the size given interval well the this quickly led one two each representing particular being placed the music with all the neumes relating back these lines had particular meaning and instead had letter placed the beginning indicating which note was however the lines indicating middle and the fifth below slowly became most having been first merely scratched the the lines now were drawn two different colored usually red for and yellow green for this was the beginning the musical staff know the completion the line staff usually credited guido arezzo one the most important musical theorists the middle while older sources attribute the development the staff some modern scholars suggest that acted more codifier system that was already being either this new notation allowed singer learn pieces completely unknown him much shorter amount however even though chant notation had progressed many one fundamental problem rhythm the neumatic notational even its fully developed did not clearly define any kind rhythm for the singing music theory the music theory the medieval period saw several advances over previous practice both regard tonal texture and rhythm concerning rhythm this period had several dramatic changes both its conception and during the early medieval period there was method notate and thus the rhythmical practice this early music subject heated debate among the first kind written rhythmic system developed during the century and was based series this rhythmic plan was codified the music theorist johannes garlandia author the mensurabili musica the treatise which defined and most completely elucidated these rhythmic modes his treatise johannes garlandia describes six species six different ways which longs and breves can each mode establishes rhythmic pattern beats tempora within common unit three tempora perfectio that repeated again and furthermore notation without text based chains ligature the characteristic notations which groups notes are bound one the rhythmic mode can generally determined the patterns ligatures once rhythmic mode had been assigned melodic there was generally little deviation from that although rhythmic adjustments could indicated changes the expected pattern even the extent changing another rhythmic the next step forward concerning rhythm came from the german theorist franco cologne his treatise ars cantus mensurabilis the art mensurable written around describes system notation which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic this striking change from the earlier system whereas before the length the individual note could only gathered from the mode this new inverted relationship made the mode dependent and determined the individual notes figurae that have incontrovertible durational innovation which had massive impact the subsequent history european most the surviving notated music the century uses the rhythmic modes defined the step the evolution rhythm came after the turn the century with the development the ars nova style the theorist who most well recognized regard this new style philippe vitry famous for writing the ars nova new treatise around this treatise music gave its name the style this entire some ways the modern system rhythmic notation began with who completely broke free from the older idea the rhythmic the notational predecessors modern time meters also originate the ars nova this new style was clearly built upon the work franco the relationship between breve and semibreves that half was equivalent that between breve and and since for him modus was always perfect grouped the tempus beat was also inherently perfect and therefore contained three sometimes the context the mode would require group only two however these two semibreves would always one normal length and one double thereby taking the same space and thus preserving the perfect subdivision the tempus this ternary division held for all note the ars nova period introduced two important the first was even smaller subdivision notes could now divided into minim and the second was the development mensurations could combined various manners produce metrical these groupings mensurations are the precursors simple and compound the time ars nova the perfect division the tempus was not the only option duple divisions became more for vitry the breve could for entire section into groups two three smaller this the tempus the term that came denote the division the could either tempus perfectus with ternary tempus imperfectus with binary similar the division termed prolation could divided into three minima prolatio perfectus major two minima prolatio imperfectus minor and the higher the longs division called modus could three two breves modus perfectus perfect modus imperfectus imperfect mode vitry took this step further indicating the proper division given piece the beginning through the use mensuration equivalent our modern time tempus perfectus was indicated while tempus imperfectus was denoted circle our current for the time signature actually holdover from this not abbreviation for common popularly while many these innovations are ascribed and somewhat present the ars nova treatise was and personal named johannes muris jehan des mars who offered the most comprehensive and systematic treatment the new mensural innovations the ars nova for brief explanation the mensural notation see the article renaissance music many citing lack positive attributory now consider treatise but this does not diminish its importance for the history rhythmic however this makes the first definitely identifiable scholar accept and explain the mensural system who can said have done for what garlandia did for the rhythmic for the duration the medieval most music would composed primarily perfect with special effects created sections imperfect there great current controversy among musicologists whether such sections were performed with breve equal length whether and what this ars nova style remained the primary rhythmical system until the highly syncopated works the ars subtilior the end the characterized extremes notational and rhythmic this genera pushed the rhythmic freedom provided ars nova its with some compositions having different voices written different tempus signatures the rhythmic complexity that was realized this music comparable that the polyphony equal importance the overall history western music theory were the textural changes that came with the advent this practice shaped western music into the dominated music that know the first accounts this textual development were found two anonymous yet widely circulated treatises the musica and the scolica enchiriadis these texts are dated sometime within the last half the ninth the treatises describe technique that seemed already well established this early polyphony based three simple and three compound the first group comprises fifths and while the second group has octave and double this new practice given the name organum the author the organum can further classified depending the time period which was the early organum described the enchiriadis can termed strict organum strict organum can subdivided into two diapente organum the interval and diatesseron organum the interval however both these kinds strict organum had problems with the musical rules the either them paralleled original chant for too long depending the tritone would this problem was somewhat overcome with the use second type organum this second style organum was called free organum its distinguishing factor that the parts did not have move only parallel but could also move contrary this made much easier avoid the dreaded the final style organum that developed was known melismatic organum which was rather dramatic departure from the rest the polyphonic music this this new style was not note against but was rather one sustained line accompanied florid melismatic this final kind organum was also incorporated the most famous polyphonic composer this onin united this style with measured discant passages which used the rhythmic modes create the pinnacle organum composition this final stage organum sometimes referred notre dame school since that was where onin and his student rotin were furthermore this kind polyphony influenced all subsequent with the later polyphonic genera motets starting trope existing notre dame organums another important element medieval music theory was the unique tonal system which pitches were arranged and during the middle this systematic arrangement series whole steps and half what now call scale was known mode the modal system worked like the scales insomuch that provided the rules and material for melodic the eight church modes dorian hypodorian phrygian hypophrygian lydian hypolydian mixolydian and hypomixolydian much the information concerning these well the practical application was codified the century the theorist johannes afflighemensis his work describes three defining elements each the finalis the reciting and the the finalis the tone that serves the focal point for the also almost always used the final tone hence the the reciting tone sometimes referred the tenor confinalis the tone that serves the primary focal point the melody particularly generally also the tone most often repeated the and finally the range ambitus the maximum proscribed tones for given the eight modes can further divided into four categories based their final finalis medieval theorists called these pairs maneriae and labeled them according the greek ordinal those modes that have and their final are put into the groups protus deuterus tritus and tetrardus respectively these can then divided further based whether the mode authentic these distinctions deal with the range the mode relation the the authentic modes have range that about octave one tone above below and start the whereas the plagal while still covering about start perfect fourth below the another interesting aspect the modal system the universal allowance for altering matter what the the inclusion this tone has several but one that seems particularly common order avoid melodic difficulties once the these ecclesiastical although they have greek have little relationship the modes set out greek rather most the terminology seems misappropriation the part the medieval theorists although the church modes have relation the ancient greek the overabundance greek terminology does point interesting possible origin the liturgical melodies the byzantine tradition this system called oktoechos and also divided into eight called echoi for

which represents the earliest known music the christian chant developed separately several european although the most important were rome hispania gaul milan and ireland there were others these chants were all developed support the regional liturgies used when celebrating the mass each area developed its own chants and rules for spain and portugal mozarabic chant was used and shows the influence north african music the mozarabic liturgy even survived through muslim rule though this was isolated strand and this music was later suppressed attempt enforce conformity the entire ambrosian chant

wanted standardize the mass and this rome was the religious centre western and paris was the political the standardization effort consisted mainly combining these two roman and gallican regional this body chant became known gregorian the and gregorian chant had superseded all the other western chant with the exception the ambrosian chant milan and the mozarabic chant few specially designated spanish early organum organum around the end the ninth singers monasteries such gall switzerland began experimenting with adding another part the generally voice parallel motion singing mostly perfect fourths fifths above the original tune see interval this development called organum and represents the beginnings harmony and ultimately counterpoint over the next several organum developed several the most significant these developments was the creation florid around sometimes known the school martial named after monastery central which contains the preserved manuscript this florid the original tune would sung long notes while accompanying voice would sing many notes each one the often highly elaborate all the while emphasizing the perfect consonances fifths and the earlier later developments organum occurred where the interval the third was particularly and where organa were likely improvised against existing chant and notre dame which was the centre musical creative activity

liturgical drama another musical tradition europe originating during the early middle ages was the liturgical drama its original may represent survival roman drama with christian stories mainly the gospel the passion and the lives the saints grafted every part europe had some sort tradition musical musical drama the middle involving speaking singing and instrumental accompaniment some these dramas were probably performed travelling actors and many have been preserved sufficiently allow modern reconstruction and performance for example the play daniel which has been recently goliards goliards the goliards were itinerant poet musicians europe from the tenth the middle the thirteenth most were scholars ecclesiastics and they wrote and sang although many the poems have very little

corresponded the equally impressive achievements gothic architecture indeed the centre activity was the cathedral notre dame itself sometimes the music this period called the parisian parisian and represents the beginning what conventionally known ars antiqua this was the period which rhythmic notation first appeared western mainly based method rhythmic notation known the rhythmic modes this was also the period which concepts formal structure developed which were attentive texture and architectural composers the period alternated florid and discant organum more opposed the succession note melismas against held notes found the florid and created several new musical clausulae which were melismatic sections organa extracted and fitted with new words and further musical conductus which was song for one more voices sung most likely procession some and tropes which were additions new words and sometimes new music sections older all these genres save one were based upon that one the usually though sometimes nearly always the lowest the tenor this sang chant though with freely composed over which the other voices sang the exception this method was the voice composition that was freely composed its the motet one the most important musical forms the high middle ages and developed initially during the notre dame period out the especially the form using multiple voices elaborated rotin who paved the way for this particularly replacing many his predecessor canon the onin lengthy florid clausulae with substitutes discant gradually there came entire books these available fitted and out the various since there were more than can possibly have been used probable that the clausulae came performed either other parts the private the thus became the motet when troped with liturgical and were further developed into form great sophistication and subtlety the fourteenth the period ars nova surviving manuscripts from this era include the montpellier codex bamberg codex and las huelgas codex composers this time include onin rotin wycombe adam victor and petrus cruce pierre petrus credited with the innovation writing more than three semibreves fit the length coming before the innovation imperfect this practice inaugurated the era what are now called petronian motets these late century works are three four parts and have multiple texts sung

liturgical subject either latin the vernacular the rhythmic values the voces organales decreased the parts with the duplum the part above the having smaller rhythmic values than the the triplum the line above the duplum having smaller rhythmic values than the duplum and time went the texts the voces organales became increasingly secular nature and had less and less overt connection the
