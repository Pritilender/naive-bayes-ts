the lead sheet for jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord the performers the jazz ensemble are expected know how flesh this basic structure adding improvised and chordal production music composed and performed for many ranging from aesthetic religious ceremonial entertainment product for the amateur musicians compose and perform music for their own and they not derive their income from professional musicians are employed range institutions and including armed churches and symphony broadcasting film production companies and music schools professional musicians sometimes work seeking contracts and engagements variety there are often many links between amateur and professional beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional community advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians variety such concert bands orchestras and other some amateur musicians attain professional level and they are able perform professional performance distinction often made between music performed for the benefit live audience and music that performed for the purpose being recorded and distributed through the music retail system the broadcasting however there are also many cases where live performance front audience recorded and distributed composition musical composition composition often classed the creation and recording music via medium which others can interpret paper many cultures use least part the concept preconceiving musical held western classical music even when music notated there are still many decisions that performer has the process performer deciding how perform music that has been previously composed and notated termed different interpretations the same music can vary composers and song writers who present their own music are just much those who perform the music others folk the standard body choices and techniques present given time and given place referred performance practice whereas interpretation generally used mean either individual choices aspect music that not and therefore has standard interpretation some musical such jazz and even more freedom given the performer engage improvisation basic harmonic rhythmic the greatest latitude given the performer style performing called free improvisation which material that spontaneously thought while being not preconceived improvised music usually follows stylistic genre conventions and even fully includes some freely chosen material composition does not always mean the use the known sole authorship one music can also determined describing process that creates musical examples this range from wind through computer programs that select music from random elements called aleatoric music and associated with such composers john morton feldman and witold awski music can composed for repeated performance can composed the the music can performed entirely from from written system musical some combination study composition has traditionally been dominated

aesthetics music philosophy music the study fundamental questions regarding the philosophical study music has many connections with philosophical questions metaphysics and aesthetics some basic questions the philosophy music what the definition what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something what the relationship between music and what does musical history reveal about the what the connection between music and what meaning relation traditionally the aesthetics music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions rhythmic and harmonic the eighteenth

through their the ancient term meaning sensory received its present day recent decades philosophers have tended emphasize issues besides beauty and for music capacity express emotion has been central the important contributions were made peter kivy jerrold levinson roger scruton and stephen davies however many music critics and other philosophers have contributed the aesthetics the significant debate arose between eduard hanslick music critic and and composer richard wagner harry partch and some other musicologists such kyle gann have studied and tried popularize microtonal music and the usage alternate musical scales also many modern composers like lamonte young rhys chatham and glenn branca paid much attention scale called just intonation often thought that music has the ability affect our emotions intellect and psychology can assuage our loneliness incite our the philosopher plato suggests the republic that music has direct effect the therefore proposes that the ideal regime music would closely regulated the book there has been strong tendency the aesthetics music emphasize the paramount importance compositional however other issues concerning the aesthetics music include

adaptive this view has been directly countered numerous music culture music cognition culture music cognition ethnomusicology culture ethnicity plays role their music cognition including their preferences emotional reaction and musical memory musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning and classification the emotion musical piece depends both culturally specific and universal structural additionally individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar sociology sociomusicology music experienced individuals range social settings ranging from being alone attending large musical performances take different forms different cultures and socioeconomic europe and north there often divide between what types music are viewed high culture and low culture high types music typically include western art music such classical romantic and era concertos and solo and are typically heard formal concerts concert halls and with the audience sitting quietly other types but not limited jazz blues soul and country are often performed nightclubs and where the audience may able dance and express themselves until the later the division between high and low musical forms was widely accepted valid distinction that separated out better more advanced art from the popular styles music heard bars and dance however the and musicologists studying this perceived divide between high and low musical genres argued that this distinction not based the musical value quality the different types citation needed rather they argued that this distinction was based largely the socioeconomics standing social class the performers audience the different types citation needed for whereas the audience for classical symphony concerts typically have average the audience for rap concert city area may have average citation needed even though the audience venue where art music performed may have lower socioeconomic the music that such rap punk funk ska may very complex and when composers introduce styles music that break with there can strong resistance from academic music experts and popular late period beethoven string stravinsky ballet scores serialism bebop era hip punk and electronica have all been considered music some critics when they were first citation needed such themes are examined the sociology the sociological study sometimes called sociomusicology often pursued departments media and closely related the field ethnomusicology media and technology computer music the music that composers make can heard through several media the most traditional way hear the presence the musicians one the outdoor indoor space such concert hall cabaret room theatre live music can also broadcast over the radio television the internet some musical styles focus producing sound for while others focus producing recording that mixes together sounds that were never played recording even

the revised berne convention for the protection literary and artistic works the united recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through devices and internet form that commonly known music demand many there less distinction between performing and listening since virtually everyone involved some sort musical often industrialized listening music through recorded such sound recording watching music video became more common than experiencing live roughly the middle the sometimes live performances incorporate prerecorded for disc jockey uses disc records for scratching and some century works have solo for instrument voice that performed along with music that prerecorded onto computers and many keyboards can programmed produce and play musical instrument digital interface music audiences can also become performers participating karaoke activity japanese origin centered device that plays eliminated versions known most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics songs being performers can follow the lyrics they sing over the instrumental internet the advent the internet has transformed the experience partly through the increased ease access music and the increased chris anderson his book the long why the future business selling less more suggests that while the economic model supply and demand describes the internet retail model based digital storage costs are company can afford make its whole inventory available giving customers much choice has thus become economically viable offer products that very few people are interested consumers growing awareness their increased choice results closer association between listening tastes and social and the creation thousands niche markets another effect the internet arises with online communities like youtube and facebook social networking service such sites simplify connecting with other and greatly facilitate the distribution professional musicians also use youtube free
