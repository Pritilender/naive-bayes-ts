name this genre with some local sources preferring instead use the very simplistic term band while others prefer the term afrobeat even though the music shares similarities with the roots this genre can traced back the bands that sprung after uganda got independence the cranes which later gave birth afrigo band can regarded the first group the evolution process this the very their music was heavily influenced soukous and congolese artists like franco were notable influences the jazz was also notable along the way there were other bands like rwenzori big five band and simba ngoma but afrigo band was the most prominent and most especially throughout the political unrest the the mid afrigo band was still heavily influenced soukous which then was dominant all over the african artists like joanita kawalya and rachael magoola were part afrigo band and helped lay the foundation for modern day alongside other bands like kaads the turning however came with the formation the record label eagles production which was responsible for producing artists like mesach semakula geoffrey lutaaya ronald mayinja and haruna mubiru these artists took the mantle from afrigo band and further developed the genre after the turn the the the genre became identified with the eagles production the label continued produce more especially female artists like cathy kusasira irene namatovu and stecia mayanja another turning point was around when david lutalo broke through with the hit song kapapala creating the way for the genre move beyond the eagles production label and for other solo artists join the about the same technology audio production had enabled the genre reproduced digitally using audio workstations and the band element had all but recording studios like dream mozart and paddyman took center many other independent solo artists started practice the artists like martin angume and even chameleone achieved success with this the genre currently the peak its evolution with

most influential style music the ugandan pop music industry for the better part the last decades the style music very similar the jamaican style and like all imported the only major difference language although most dancehall artists will perform their local this case luganda many them will every now and then try mimic jamaican patois during the early mid when pop industry was just beginning the first international music make impression ugandan artists was the raggamuffin music jamaica the artists like shabba ranks and buju banton became the inspiration for ugandan artists like shanks vivi ragga dee menton krono and rasta the predominant beat that was used these artists was the dem bow beat which was created shabba locally this beat sometimes referred kadu which verbal imitation the kind sound this beat became the foundation which all ugandan dancehall was built just like did with reggaeton the late new artists like mega dee and emperor orlando joined the the turn the dancehall ragga commonly was already the most popular music new artists like chameleone bebe cool and bobi wine joined the scene and consolidated but they create any marked improvement the quality and sound the music they remained pretty simplistic and heavily based dem from then the quality music became commensurate the quality production chameleone was the first dancehall artist try fuse this ragga sound with other genres like soukous and kadongo kamu around there were variety musicians practicing the genre but also without much advancement style this jamaican dancehall had already taken sharp turn away from the harsh ragga sound based chatting over simplistic riddims and there was new wave dancehall deejays like vybz kartel and busy signal who were deejaying over more advanced artists like hilderman came into the scene with new words like double bed mazongoto and have continued its not until very recently that have begun also see new ugandan artists like rabadaba sizza and fidempa create more modern version ugandan dancehall artists have reaped big from the many are industrious and live luxurious hip hip hop music uganda modeled after american hip hop there really not much difference stylistically between ugandan hip hop and the american because the digital there access modern production technologies uganda hence the beats that current local producers are creating are astonishingly high quality and not far behind the american the fundamental difference between the two genres that most african most artists will rap their local the language luganda this has created the synonym lugaflow further define ugandan rap hip hop one the newer genres widely practiced the two music klear kut and bataka squad were the first musical acts hip hop back the late mainstream acceptance for the music genre was almost non existent however number the members the afore mentioned groups persisted with the especially navio and others like sylvester abramz also kept creating rap focusing socially conscious themes and around the middle the previous more acts started joining the with rocky giant being one the first rappers embraced the but was not until gnl disambiguation needed broke through circa that the genre really gained gnl made hip hop more acceptable and accessible and many lugaflow rappers began since then there has been flurry activity the scene with sizable number rappers enjoying relative success the music industry and the radio with hip uganda modeled after american there not much history ugandan with steve jean being the first artist practice the genre around the turn the but was michael ross disambiguation needed who really begun the trend circa with songs like how you love and was not until circa that number musicians started embrace the with myco chris and baby joe among those diaspora that must blu and aziz azion are notable recently artists like nick richy pallaso woodz and yoyo have spread the appeal the genre gospel early gospel music uganda was modeled mainly after praise and worship music practiced church choirs and particularly the pentecostal born again movement locally referred balokole artists like fiona mukasa the mid were responsible for taking praise and worship music out the churches and onto the because the influence soukous music the this early gospel had soukous limit were another gospel group that gained popularity during the just after the turn the the styles gospel became more with various groups like first love and sauti adding the urban sound created limit others like george okudi and father musaala had surprising hits the radio circuit and however was with the break through judith babirye circa that gospel started have notable impact the music babirye whose music was similar fiona was instant hit and her song beera was among the songs the year its year she was followed wilson bugembe another musician who was readily embraced the listening public with his songs becoming national cutting across all recently they have been joined various new artists spanning various music industry today uganda has vibrant music industry that plays fundamental role the social and economic lives musicians are the main celebrities uganda and all entertainment content from the mainstream media will most times about music the private lives musicians are closely followed many music concerts most times called album launches are very many companies spend huge amounts money sponsoring these music concerts and advertisements for the concerts are very common radio and the emphasis music concerts comes from the fact that very few music artists make worthwhile income from sales their music physical the lack any distribution structure means that there little incentive for capital investment artist development music there are genuine record labels with most the companies that are referred labels being merely artist management because these there severe strain placed upon musicians find profitability and sustainability making however this somehow does not seem deter new musicians from there very healthy production rate young and talented there have also been efforts organizing the music with the uganda publishing rights society and uganda musicians association being prime examples alongside number music awards organizations like pam awards attempts some these organizations make use utilized and largely ignored copyright law generate revenue from music distribution have proved these are some the challenges facing the music industry the country and indeed are very similar the ones facing most music industries around the see also baganda music kadongo kamu kidandali
