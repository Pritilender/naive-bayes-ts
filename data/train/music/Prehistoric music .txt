evolutionary origins music mostly started the second half the and was much discussed within music archaeology the after the appearance the collection articles the origins merker brown the subject was debated topic human evolutionary there are currently many hypotheses not necessarily about the origins some suggest that the origin music likely stems from naturally occurring sounds and rhythms human music may echo these phenomena using patterns repetition and tonality even some cultures have certain instances their music intending imitate natural sounds some this feature related shamanistic

the origin music difficult music evokes strong emotions and changed states awareness generally strong emotions are associated with evolution sex and but there clear link between music and between music and regarding musicians often may use music attract mates for example male birds may use their plumage attract but that just one many functions music and one many ways attract regarding societies with musical culture may better able survive because the music coordinates their helps important messages communicated within the group motivates them identify with the and motivates them support other group however difficult demonstrate that effects this kind can enhance the survival one group competition with other once music effects this kind may promote its development but unclear whether effects this kind can explain ultimate another possible origin music the gestural communication between adults usually and this form communication involves rhythmic and movement patterns well the communication intention and and this sense similar motherese has two main strengthen bonding between mother and and help the infant acquire both these functions enhance the chances survival and may therefore subject natural motherese has gestural vocabulary that similar across the way mothers and babies raise and lower their voices and simultaneously change their expressions and move their hands similar asia and for example spite linguistic differences such tone languages versus tone the apparent universality motherese could explained either genetically universals the human genetic explanation for the vocabulary motherese would have biological and such explanation has yet been regarding motherese may stem from universals the prenatal the human fetus can hear for weeks before birth considerably longer than other most which cannot hear before birth the fetus can also perceive movement and orientation for weeks before this presumably not accident but adaptation that promotes the survival the infant after birth improving bonding between the infant and the the fetus learns perceive the emotional state the mother via the internal sounds her body heartbeat footsteps digestion can presumably adjust its postnatal demands crying depending her availability and that way enhance its own survival fragile being dangerous world citation needed research citation needed the ability the fetus learn and remember sound and the active way nature mother infant communication consistent with this this theory the internal sounds the human body and the relationship between those patterns and emotional state may the ultimate source the relationship between patterns sound and movement music and their strong emotional this theory consistent with the universal link between music and religion and the changed states consciousness that music can charles darwin idea about the importance music for human sexual selection found new development idea the role musical display for demonstrating fitness based the ideas honest signal and the handicap principle miller suggested that music and energetically costly were demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness the singing and dancing individual the prospective critics this approach note how most species where singing used for the purposes sexual selection through female choice only males sing who are trying impress females with different audio and visual and males rule sing among humans both males and females are ardent and making music mostly communal communal singing both sexes occurs among many cooperatively breeding songbirds australia and africa such the butcherbirds fairywrens white browed sparrow weaver and turdoides species but absent from hominid prehistoric musical instruments likely that the first musical instrument was the human voice itself which can make vast array from singing humming and whistling through clicking coughing and yawning see origin species music speech the oldest known neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form has been dated years predating the oldest known paleolithic bone flute some years but the true chronology may date back much most likely the first rhythm instruments percussion instruments involved the clapping stones hit other things that are useful create rhythm and indeed there are examples musical instruments which date back far the paleolithic although there some ambiguity over archaeological finds which can variously interpreted either musical musical examples paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes paleolithic finds which are open interpretation are pierced phalanges usually interpreted phalangeal whistles objects interpreted bullroarers and rasps music can thetically traced prior the oldowan era the paleolithic age the anthropological and archaeological designation suggests that music first arose among when stone tools first began used hominids the noises produced work such pounding seed and roots into meal likely source rhythm created early flutes paleolithic flutes the oldest flute ever discovered may the called divje babe flute found the slovenian cave divje babe though this the item question fragment the femur juvenile cave bear and has been dated about years however whether truly musical instrument simply chewed bone matter ongoing some that were discovered years earlier the gei sterle cave received new high resolution carbon dating examination yielding age years archaeologists discovered bone flute the hohle fels cave near ulm germany the holed flute has shaped mouthpiece and made from vulture wing the researchers involved the discovery officially published their findings the journal nature june one several similar instruments found the which date least years making this one the oldest confirmed find any musical instruments the hohle fels flute was found next the venus hohle fels and short distance from the oldest known human carving announcing the scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence established musical tradition the time when modern humans colonized scientists have also suggested that the discovery the flute may help explain why early humans while neanderthals became the oldest known wooden pipes were discovered wicklow ireland the winter lined pit contained group six flutes made from yew between and tapered one but without any finger they may once have been strapped several gudi literally bone were found jiahu henan china they date about bce they have between and holes each and were made from the hollow bones the red crowned crane the time the one was found still the bone flute plays both the note scale xia zhi and note scale qing shang the ancient chinese musical system archaeoacoustic methodology the use the term problematic within may the traditional music much saharan the concept understand was somewhat many languages traditionally have terms for music that include religion the context which prehistoric music took place has also become subject much the sound made music prehistory would have been somewhat different depending the acoustics the field archaeoacoustics uses acoustic techniques explore prehistoric soundscapes and and has included the study ringing rocks and the acoustics ritual sites such chamber tombs and stone and the exploration prehistoric instruments using acoustic such work has included acoustic field tests capture and analyse the impulse response archaeological acoustic tests lithophones rock and reconstructions soundscapes experimental academic research the
