perceiving rhythm must able anticipate this depends upon repetition pattern that short enough the alternation the strong and weak beat fundamental the ancient language dance and the common poetic term foot refers the lifting and tapping the foot similar way musicians speak upbeat and downbeat and the and off beat these contrasts naturally facilitate dual hierarchy rhythm and depend upon repeating patterns accent and rest forming that corresponds the poetic foot normally such groups are defined taking the most accented beat the first and counting the pulses until the next accent macpherson

arranged with respect time signature partially signifying meter usually corresponding measure length and grouped into either two three which are called duple meter and triple meter respectively the beats are consistently even odd groups three simple meter admixtures two and three compound meter other systems music such indian classical music rhythms may grouped into various number some music styles such yakshagana even group rhythms into fractional tempo and duration see main duration tempo the tempo the piece the speed frequency the tactus measure how quickly the beat this often measured

discussion and debate agawu john miller chernoff has argued that west african music based tension between this tension between rhythms called polyrhythms and created the simultaneous sounding two more different often there dominant rhythm interacting with independent competing these often oppose complement each and combine freely with the dominant rhythm creating rich rhythmic texture not limited any one set meter set moral values underpins full musical system based repetition relatively simple patterns that meet distant rhythmic intervals and call and answer values also show collective utterances such proverbs lineages appear either phrases that translate drum talk the words people expect musicians stimulate participation all notably reacting people dancing the appreciation musicians related the effectiveness their upholding community values chernoff page needed indian music indian music has also been passed tabla players would learn speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting play sheila chandra english pop singer indian made performances based her singing these indian classical music the tala composition the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece western music the composers like igor stravinsky philip glass and steve reich wrote more rhythmically complex music using odd meters and techniques such phasing and additive rhythm the same modernists such olivier messiaen and his pupils used increased complexity disrupt the sense regular leading eventually the widespread use irrational rhythms new complexity this use may explained comment john cage where notes that regular rhythms cause sounds heard group rather than the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings sandow lamonte young also wrote music which the sense regular beat absent because the music consists only long sustained tones drones the henry cowell wrote music
