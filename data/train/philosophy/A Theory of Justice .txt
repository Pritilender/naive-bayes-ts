rawls argues for principled reconciliation liberty and equality the circumstances are inspired david hume the fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances similar some immanuel kant principles justice are guide the conduct the the parties are under moderate scarcity and are neither naturally altruistic nor purely they seek cooperation with others common parties assume fair choice situation called the original position with its veil ignorance under such the parties are supposed find these two principles justice especially over including utilitarian and right libertarian the original original position rawls belongs the social contract tradition however rawls social contract takes different view from that previous specifically rawls develops what claims are principles justice through the use artificial device calls the original position which everyone decides principles justice from behind veil ignorance this veil one that essentially blinds people all facts about themselves they cannot tailor principles their one knows his place his class position social nor does anyone know his fortune the distribution natural assets and his strength and the shall even assume that the parties not know their conceptions the good their special psychological the principles justice are chosen behind veil rawls when individual does not know how will wants scheme justice that treats all they favour maximin strategy which maximises the prospects the least they are the principles that rational and free persons concerned further their own interests would accept initial position equality defining the fundamentals the terms their association rawls the parties original position adopt two which govern the assignment rights and duties and regulate the distribution social and economic advantages the principles permit inequalities the distribution goods only the inequalities benefit the off member this principles the rational choice each member has equal claim the goods the result both hypothetical and ahistorical hypothetical the agreement parties under hypothetical conditions reality they may not reach the same the principles justice are what would agreed upon people were the hypothetical situation the original ahistorical because such agreement has never derived the real world outside carefully limited experimental the first principle justice first each person have rights equal the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for the first principle affirms for all citizens familiar basic rights and liberty conscience and freedom freedom speech and liberty the the rights hold public treated accordance with the rule and rawls stanford encyclopedia philosophy the basic liberty citizen political liberty vote and run for freedom speech and liberty freedom personal property and freedom from arbitrary however liberties not the for the right own certain kinds property means and freedom contract understood the doctrine laissez faire are not and they are not protected the priority the first political conception justice moral conception generated from the fundamental ideas implicit that public political political conception not derived from any particular comprehensive nor compromise among the worldviews that happen exist society the rather political conception its content set out independently the comprehensive doctrines that citizens reasonable who want cooperate with one another mutually acceptable will see that freestanding political conception generated from ideas the public political culture the only basis for cooperation that all citizens can reasonably expected the use coercive political power guided the principles political conception justice will therefore coercion the second principle justice the difference principle fair equality opportunity claim that departures from equality list what calls primary things which rational man wants whatever else are justified only the extent that they improve the lot those who are off under that distribution comparison with the equal distribution his position least some sense egalitarian with provison that equality not achieved worsening the position the least important consequence however that inequalities can actually just view long they are the benefit the least well his argument for this position rests heavily the claim that morally arbitrary factors for the family one born shouldn determine life chances rawls also keying intuition that person does not morally deserve their inborn thus that one not entitled all the benefits they could possibly receive from hence least one the criteria which could provide alternative equality assessing the justice distributions the stipulation lexically prior that fair equality opportunity requires not merely that offices and positions are distributed the basis but that all have reasonable opportunity acquire the skills the basis which merit may thought that this and even the first principle may require greater equality than the difference because large social and economic even when they are the advantage the will tend seriously undermine the value the political liberties and any measures towards fair equality relationship later work the original theory was important but controversial and much criticized work political although rawls never retreated from the core argument theory modified his theory substantially subsequent works such justice restatement which clarified and organised much the argument theory justice criticism rawls colleague robert nozick published defense libertarian justice anarchy state and utopia another harvard michael walzer wrote defense communitarian political spheres justice result seminar taught with related line michael sandel also harvard wrote liberalism and the limits justice which criticized rawls for asking think about justice while divorced from the values and aspirations that define who are and which allow determine what justice robert paul wolff wrote understanding critique and reconstruction theory justice which criticized rawls from marxist immediately following the publication theory justice wolff argues this work that theory apology for the status quo insofar constructs justice from existing practice and forecloses the possibility that there may problems injustice embedded capitalist social private property the market feminist critics such susan moller okin largely focused weakness accounting for the injustices and hierarchies embedded familial rawls argued that justice ought only apply the basic structure feminists rallying around the theme the personal took rawls task for failing account for injustices found patriarchal social relations and the gendered division especially the the assumptions the original and the use maximin reasoning have also been criticized most notably kenneth arrow and john harsanyi with the implication either that rawls designed the original position derive the two that original position more faithful its initial purpose would not lead his favored reply rawls has emphasized the role the original position device for making sense the idea fair choice situation for free and equal rawls has also emphasized the relatively modest role that maximin plays his useful heuristic rule given the curious features choice behind the veil some egalitarian critics have raised concerns over emphasis primary social for amartya sen has argued that should attend not only the distribution primary but also how effectively people are able use those goods pursue their related norman daniels has wondered why health care shouldn treated primary and some his subsequent work has addressed this arguing for right health care within broadly rawlsian philosopher allan bloom student leo strauss criticized rawls for failing account for the existence natural right his theory and wrote that rawls absolutizes social union the ultimate goal which would conventionalize everything into other criticisms theory have come from the philosopher gerald cohen cohen series influential papers culminated first his how come and then his later rescuing justice and cohen criticisms are leveled against avowal inequality under the difference principle against his application the principle only social and against rawlsian obsession with the using primary goods

justice means and the stress put objectivity equality removal and however sen part his general critique the contractarian states that ideas about perfectly just world not help redress actual existing sen faults rawls for emphasis institutions guarantors justice not considering the effects human behaviour the ability maintain just sen believes rawls understates the difficulty getting everyone society adhere the norms just sen also claims that position that there only one possible outcome the reflective equilibrium behind the veil ignorance sen believes that multiple conflicting but just
