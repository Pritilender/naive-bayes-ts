judgment judgments aesthetic value rely our ability discriminate sensory aesthetics examines our affective domain response object immanuel kant writing observes man says that canary wine agreeable quite content someone else corrects his terms and reminds him say agreeable because everyone has his own sense taste the case beauty different from mere agreeableness because proclaims something then requires the same liking from then judges not just for himself but for and speaks beauty were property aesthetic judgments usually beyond sensory for david hume delicacy taste not merely the ability detect all the ingredients but also our sensitivity pains well which escape the rest essays moral political and indianapolis literary classics thus the sensory discrimination linked capacity for

emotional and intellectual all viewer interpretations beauty possess two concepts aesthetics and aesthetics the philosophical notion taste result education process and awareness elite cultural values

beauty subjective and thus certain things are beautiful citation needed the contemporary view beauty not based innate but rather cultural specifics and individual citation needed factors involved aesthetic judgment judgments aesthetical values seem often involve many other kinds issues responses such disgust show that sensory detection linked instinctual ways facial expressions and even behaviors like the gag reflex yet disgust can often learned cultural issue darwin pointed seeing stripe soup beard disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves aesthetic judgments may linked emotions like partially embodied our physical seeing sublime view landscape may give reaction awe which might manifest physically increased heart rate widened these unconscious reactions may even partly constitutive what makes our judgment judgment that the landscape likewise aesthetic judgments may culturally conditioned some victorians britain often saw african sculpture but just few decades edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures being evaluations beauty may well linked perhaps even sexual desirability thus judgments aesthetic value can become linked judgments political moral value current one might judge lamborghini beautiful partly because desirable status might judge repulsive partly because signifies for consumption and offends our political moral aesthetic judgments can often very grained and internally likewise aesthetic judgments seem often least partly intellectual and what thing means symbolizes for that often what are modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant aesthetic yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics some century the point already made hume but see mary beauty and the the blackwell guide thus aesthetic judgments might seen based the emotions intellectual will desires culture preferences values subconscious conscious training instinct sociological some complex combination depending exactly which theory one are different art forms disgusting boring the same third major topic the study aesthetic judgments how they are unified across art can call and mathematical proof beautiful what characteristics they share which give them that what possible feature could proof and fragrance both share virtue which they both count what makes painting beautiful quite different from what makes music which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement the same there seemingly quite lack words express oneself accurately when making aesthetic aesthetic judgment cannot empirical therefore due impossibility for there confusion about what interpretations can culturally due imprecision the standard english two completely different feelings experienced two different people can represented identical verbal wittgenstein stated this his lectures aesthetics and language collective identification with willing participants given social may socially negotiated discussed culture there some underlying unity aesthetic judgment and there some way articulate the similarities beautiful beautiful and beautiful defining requires description the entire wittgenstein argued his lectures likewise there has been long debate how perception beauty the natural especially perception the human form supposed relate perceiving beauty art artefacts this goes back least with some echoes even bonaventure citation needed what art how best define the term art subject constant many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics what mean the term art theodor adorno claimed evident that nothing concerning art artists philosophers anthropologists psychologists and programmers all use the notion art their respective and give operational definitions that vary furthermore clear that even the basic meaning the term art has changed several times over the and has continued evolve during the century the main recent sense the word art roughly abbreviation for creative art fine art here mean that skill being used express the engage the aesthetic draw the audience towards consideration the finer things often the skill being used functional people will consider craft instead suggestion which highly disputed many contemporary craft thinkers likewise the skill being used commercial industrial way may considered design instead contrariwise these may defended art perhaps called applied art some for have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more with the actual function the object than any clear definitional art usually implies function other than convey communicate citation needed even late was normal the west assume that all art aims and thus that anything that trying beautiful count the cubists dadaists stravinsky and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central the definition with such success according danto beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art the but from the advanced philosophy art that decade perhaps some notion like expression croce theories mcluhan theory can replace the previous role brian massumi brought back beauty into consideration together with expression another important the philosophy art that the elaborated upon the twentieth century the postmodern philosopher jean ois lyotard further elaborated malraux works such the voices silence that art fundamentally response metaphysical question malraux argues while art has sometimes been oriented towards beauty and the sublime principally renaissance european these the wider history art are means essential perhaps definition art possible perhaps art should thought cluster related concepts wittgensteinian fashion weitz beuys another approach say that art basically sociological that whatever art schools and museums and artists define art considered art regardless formal this institutional definition see also institutional critique has been championed george dickie most people did not consider the depiction brillo box bought urinal art until andy warhol and marcel duchamp placed them the context art the art gallery which then provided the

shorthand notes help him write longer article these would not leo tolstoy the other claims that what decides whether not something art how experienced its not the intention its functionalists like monroe beardsley argue that whether not piece counts art depends what function plays particular the same greek vase may play artistic function one context carrying and artistic function another

the marxist philosopher louis althusser gary tedman defines art terms social reproduction the relations production the aesthetic classificatory disputes about art what should art many goals have been argued for and aestheticians often argue that some goal another superior some clement greenberg for argued that each artistic medium should seek that which makes unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself anything other than expression its own uniqueness the dadaist tristan tzara the other hand saw the function art the destruction mad social must sweep and affirm the cleanliness the individual after the state aggressive complete madness world abandoned the hands formal creative self political spiritual philosophical and even more perceptual aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures what art should the value art tolstoy defined art the art human activity consisting that one man means certain external hands others feelings has lived and that other people are infected these feelings and also experience however this definition merely starting point for his theory some the value for one with the value however sometimes empathy not chapter fifteen what tolstoy says that some feelings are but others are and art only valuable when generates empathy shared feeling for good for tolstoy asserts that empathy for decadent members the ruling class makes society rather

other achievements which human beings have shown themselves both individually and collectively true that art appears possess special capacity endure live beyond the moment its many cases for centuries this capacity art endure over time what precisely and how operates has been widely neglected modern aesthetic universals the philosopher denis dutton identified six universal signatures human expertise humans recognize and admire technical artistic nonutilitarian people enjoy art for and demand that keep them warm put food the style artistic objects and performances satisfy rules composition that place them recognizable criticism people make point appreciating and interpreting works imitation with few important exceptions like abstract works art simulate experiences the special art set aside from ordinary life and made dramatic focus might however that there are rather too many exceptions for the installations the contemporary artist thomas hirschhorn deliberately eschew technical people can appreciate renaissance madonna for aesthetic but such objects often had and sometimes still specific devotional rules that might read into duchamp fountain john cage not locate the works recognizable style certainly not style recognizable the time the realisation moreover some categories seem too physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds her imagination the course formulating another problem that categories seek universalise traditional european notions aesthetics and art forgetting malraux and others have pointed there have been large numbers cultures which such ideas including the idea art itself were criticism the philosophy aesthetics practice has been criticized some sociologists and writers art and raymond williams argues that there unique and individual aesthetic object which can extrapolated from the art but that there continuum cultural forms and experience which ordinary speech and experiences may signal art may frame several artistic works creations though this reference remains within the institution special event which creates and this leaves some works other possible art outside the frame other interpretations such other
