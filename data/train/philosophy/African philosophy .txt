among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work the century philosopher zera yacob and that his walda heywat southern africa southern africa and southeast africa the development distinctive bantu philosophy addressing the nature the cosmos and relation the world following the bantu migration has had the most significant impact the philosophical developments southeast africa and southern africa with the development the philosophy ubuntu one notable example emerging from this central africa many central african philosophical traditions before the bantu migration into southern central africa have been identified uniting characteristic many nilotic and sudanic peoples ultimately giving rise the distinctive worldviews identified the conceptions the creation the human and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent dinka mythology maasai mythology and similar african diaspora some modern african diasporic philosophical traditions have also been mostly produced descendants africans europe and the one notable modern diasporic african philosopher was anthony william amo who was taken slave from awukenu what now ghana and was brought and educated europe where gained doctorates medicine and and subsequently became professor philosophy the universities halle halle and jena modern african philosophy kenyan philosopher henry odera oruka has distinguished what calls four trends modern african ethnophilosophy philosophical nationalistic ideological and professional fact would more realistic call them candidates for the position african with the understanding that more than one them might fit the oruka later added two additional literary artistic such the work literary figures such wole soyinka chinua achebe okot bitek and taban liyong and hermeneutic the analysis african languages order find philosophical the african american philosopher maulana karenga has also been notable presenting varied definitions for understanding modern african especially relates its earliest ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity ethnophilosophy has been used record the beliefs found african such approach treats african philosophy consisting set shared values categories and assumptions that are implicit the practices and beliefs african the uniquely african worldview seen item communal property rather than activity for the one proponent this placide tempels argued bantu philosophy that the metaphysical categories the bantu people are reflected their linguistic according this african philosophy can best understood springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected the languages another example this sort approach the work algoa the university port harcourt nigeria who argues for the existence african philosophy history stemming from traditional proverbs from the niger delta his paper african philosophy history the oral algoa argues that african age seen important factor gaining wisdom and interpreting the support this cites proverbs such more more and what old man sees youth does not see truth seen eternal and unchanging truth never but people are subject error even legged horse stumbles and dangerous judge appearances large eye does not mean keen but hand observation can trusted who sees does not the past not seen fundamentally different from the but all history contemporary history storyteller does not tell different the future remains beyond knowledge even bird with long neck cannot see the nevertheless god will outlive history seen vitally important one ignorant his origin and historians known sons the are highly revered the son the soil has the keen however these arguments must taken with grain cultural the span culture africa incredibly with matriarchies monotheists and traditional religionists among the and such the attitudes groups the niger delta cannot construed the whole another more controversial application this approach embodied the concept negritude leopold senghor proponent argued that the distinctly african approach reality based emotion rather than works itself out participation rather than and manifests itself through the arts rather than the cheikh anta diop and mubabinge the other while agreeing that african culture challenged the view africans essentially emotional and pointing out that egypt was african culture whose achievements science mathematics architecture and philosophy were this philosophy may also maligned overly reductionist due the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs not only ancient but also meroe well the great library the extensive trade networks and kingdoms north west central the horn africa and great zimbabwe and the other major empires southeast and central critics this approach argue that the actual philosophical work producing coherent philosophical position being done the academic philosopher such and that the sayings the same culture can selected from and organised many different ways order produce very often contradictory systems philosophical sagacity sort individualist version which one records the beliefs certain special members the premise here although most societies demand some degree conformity belief and behaviour from their certain few those members reach particularly high level knowledge and standing their worldviews such people are some the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding reflection and questioning these become the targets philosophical critics this approach note that not all reflection and questioning besides african philosophy were defined purely terms philosophic then the thoughts the sages could not african for they did not record them from other also this view the only difference between african anthropology ethnology and african philosophy seems the nationality the critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity that there surely important distinction between philosophy and the history although other philosophers consider the two topics remarkably citation needed the argument that matter how interesting the beliefs people such the akan the yoruba may the they remain not call them philosophy use secondary sense that such philosophy live and let professional philosophy professional philosophy usually identified that produced african philosophers trained the western philosophical that embraces universal view the methods and concerns those philosophers identified this category often explicitly reject the assumptions ethnophilosophy and adopt universalist worldview philosophy that requires all philosophy accessible and applicable all peoples and cultures the world this even the specific philosophical questions prioritized
