century justify their desire break away from the pope and the catholic though many these philosophical ideals were picked russell the century the enlightenment was the principal manifestation the schism that began with martin chartier argues that the enlightenment was only invented after the fact for political claims the leaders the french revolution created enlightenment canon basic selecting certain authors and identifying them with the enlightenment order legitimize their republican political historian jonathan israel rejects the attempts postmodern and marxian historians understand the revolutionary ideas the period purely products social and economic instead focuses the history ideas the period from the end the and claims that was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually led the revolutions the latter half the century and the early israel argues that until the western civilization was based largely shared core tradition and until this date most intellectual debates revolved around confessional that lutheran reformed anglican and the main aim these debates was establish which bloc faith ought have the monopoly truth and given title after this date everything thus previously rooted tradition was questioned and often replaced new concepts the light philosophical after the second half the century and during the century general process rationalization and secularization set which rapidly overthrew old hegemony the world and thus confessional disputes were reduced secondary status favor the escalating contest between faith and this

different philosophical like those the writings descartes john locke isaac newton christian wolff expressed some support for critical review and renewal the old modes but other parts sought reform and accommodation with the old systems power and these two lines thought were again met the conservative encompassing those thinkers who held the traditional based systems time span there little consensus

process communicative always asks for rational national variations war the spanish succession the enlightenment operated most but often with specific local for example france became associated with government and church while germany reached deep into the middle classes and expressed spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments established government responses varied france the government was and the philosophes fought against its they were sometimes imprisoned hounded into the british government generally ignored the leaders england and although did give isaac

response was the formation the late century and century the bourgeois public realm communication marked new arenas more open and accessible forms urban public space and and explosion print more habermas highlights three essential elements the public was discussed the domain common argument was founded alexander von humboldt james van horn melton provides good summary the values this

contrasted their conception the public with that the chartier cites condorcet who contrasted opinion with marmontel with the opinion men versus the opinion the and alembert who contrasted the truly

extent which freemasonry was part even main factor the the one historians agree that the famous leaders the enlightenment included freemasons such voltaire pope horace sir robert mozart goethe frederick the benjamin and george the other historians such robert roswell palmer concluded that even masons were politically innocuous not and did not act american while noting that benjamin franklin

enlightened they can hardly described major radical reformist network their own salons historiography the salon historiography debates historian keith thomas says the enlightenment has always been contested says that its however its enemies accuse rationalism unrealistic and moral thomas points out that from the start there was enlightenment which conservative and clerical defenders traditional

interpretation has been adopted many historians since the and perhaps the most commonly used interpretation dorinda outram provides good example intellectual definition the enlightenment was desire for human affairs guided rationality rather than superstition belief the power human reason change society and liberate the individual from the restraints custom arbitrary all backed world view increasingly validated science rather than religion political thought rousseau atlantic slave trade like the french the enlightenment has long been hailed the foundation modern western political and intellectual has been frequently linked the french revolution however roger chartier points was perhaps the revolution that invented the enlightenment attempting root its legitimacy corpus texts and founding authors reconciled and their preparation rupture with the old other the revolutionaries elevated heroic status those such voltaire and rousseau who could used justify their radical break with the ancien gime any two century historians the hippolyte taine and alexis tocqueville did much solidify this link enlightenment causing revolution and the intellectual perception the enlightenment alternative perspective revolutionaries using the works philosophers such voltaire and rousseau excuses and justifications for engaging revolution the more plausible perspective that the government philosophy consent the delineated locke two treatises government represented paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known the divine right the more correct perspective what caused the revolutions from the late the early was this governance paradigm shift that often could not resolved peacefully and violent revolution was the clearly governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was direct conflict with governance philosophy where citizens natural law had consent the acts and rulings their his gime hippolyte taine traced the roots the french revolution back french classicism however this was not without the help the scientific view the world the which wore down the monarchical and religious dogma the old other words taine was only interested the enlightenment insofar advanced scientific discourse and transmitted what perceived the intellectual legacy french alexis tocqueville painted more elaborate picture the enlightenment ancien gime volution for the revolution was the inevitable result the radical opposition created the century between the monarchy and the men letters the these men letters constituted sort substitute aristocracy that was both powerful and without real this illusory power came from the rise public born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeosie from the political the literary that resulted promoted discourse equality and was hence fundamental opposition the monarchical johann struensee tocqueville clearly the cultural effects transformation the forms the exercise nevertheless took another century before cultural approach became central the typified robert the business publishing history the dijn argues that peter gay the interpretation first formulated the interpretation that the enlightenment brought political modernization the terms introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation liberal while the thesis has many critics has been widely accepted anglophone scholars and has been reinforced the scale studies robert darnton roy porter and most recently jonathan religious debate enlightenment era religious commentary was response the preceding century religious conflict especially the thirty war theologians the enlightenment wanted reform their faith its generally confrontational roots and limit the capacity for religious controversy spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining true faith god for moderate this meant return simple john locke abandoned the corpus theological commentary favor unprejudiced the word god determined the essence christianity belief christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed thomas jefferson the jefferson bible went dropped any passages dealing with visitations and the resurrection jesus after his tried extract the practical christian moral code the new testament enlightenment scholars sought curtail the political power organized religion and thereby prevent another age intolerant religious spinoza determined remove politics from contemporary and historical theology disregarding judaic law moses mendelssohn advised affording political weight any organized but instead recommended that each person follow what found most good religion based instinctive morals and belief god should not theoretically need force maintain order its and both mendelssohn and spinoza judged religion its moral not the logic its number novel religious ideas developed with enlightened including deism and talk atheism deism according thomas paine the simple belief god the creator with reference the bible any other miraculous instead the deist relies solely personal reason guide his which was eminently agreeable many thinkers the atheism was much discussed but there were few wilson and reill note very few enlightened even when they were vocal critics were true rather they were critics orthodox wedded rather deism vitalism perhaps some followed pierre bayle and argued that atheists could indeed moral many others like voltaire held that without belief god who punishes the moral order society was that since atheists gave themselves supreme authority and and had fear eternal they were far more likely disrupt bayle observed that his prudent persons will always maintain appearance locke considered the consequences for mankind there were god and divine the result would moral every individual could have law but his own end but would god and the satisfaction his own will the sole measure and end all his the person could generally believe any controversial religion that had agreeable moral code and professed faith but irreligious behavior was not intellectual history the though intellectual history remained the dominant historiographical the german scholar ernst cassirer writing his the philosophy the enlightenment that the enlightenment was part and special phase that whole intellectual development through which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic confidence and borrowing from cassirer states that enlightenment the process which the spirit achieves clarity and depth its understanding its own nature and and its own fundamental character and the enlightenment was series scientific and otherwise intellectual developments that took place mostly the century the birthplace intellectual recent work only the did
