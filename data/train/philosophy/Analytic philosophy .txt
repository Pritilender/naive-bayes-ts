university philosophy departments identify themselves analytic departments the term analytic can refer broad philosophical tradition characterized emphasis clarity and argument often achieved via modern formal logic and analysis language and respect for the natural sciences the more specific set developments early century philosophy that were the historical antecedents the broad the work bertrand russell ludwig wittgenstein moore gottlob frege and logical positivists this narrower analytic philosophy identified with specific philosophical commitments many which are rejected contemporary analytic such the logical positivist principle that there are specifically philosophical truths and that the object philosophy the logical clarification this may contrasted with the traditional foundationalism which considers philosophy special science discipline that investigates the fundamental reasons and principles consequently many analytic philosophers have considered their inquiries continuous subordinate those the natural the principle that the logical clarification thoughts can only achieved analysis the logical form philosophical the logical form proposition way

against this intellectual background that the founders analytic moore and bertrand russell articulated the program early analytic since its basic principle analytic philosophy has been conceptual the name which moore and russell rejected hegelianism which they accused obscurity and idealism inspired developments modern the early russell claimed that the problems philosophy can solved showing the simple constituents complex important aspect british idealism was logical holism the view that the aspects the world cannot wholly known without also knowing the whole this closely related the view that relations between things are actually internal relations that properties internal the nature those russell along with response promulgated logical atomism and the doctrine external relations the belief that the world consists independent facts russell during his early along with his collaborator alfred north whitehead was much influenced gottlob frege who developed predicate logic which allowed much greater range sentences parsed into logical form than was possible with the ancient aristotelian frege was also influential philosopher mathematics germany the beginning the contrast husserl book philosophie der arithmetik which attempted show that the concept the cardinal number derived from psychical acts grouping objects and counting frege sought show that mathematics and logic have their own independent the judgments mental states individual mathematicians and logicians which were the basis arithmetic according the psychologism philosophie frege further developed his philosophy logic and mathematics the foundations arithmetic and the basic laws arithmetic where provided alternative psychologistic accounts the concept like bertrand russell and alfred north whitehead attempted show that mathematics reducible fundamental logical their principia mathematica encouraged many philosophers renew their interest with the development symbolic logic additionally bertrand russell adopted predicate logic his primary philosophical method russell thought could expose the underlying structure philosophical for the english word has three distinct meanings which can parsed predicate logic the for the sentence the cat asleep the predication means that denoted for the sentence there the existence means that there for the sentence three half the identity means that the same russell sought resolve various philosophical issues applying such logical most famously his analysis definite descriptions ideal language analysis linguistic philosophy from about analytic philosophers like russell and ludwig wittgenstein emphasized creating ideal language for philosophical which would free from the ambiguities ordinary language their often made philosophy this philosophical trend can called language formalism during this russell and wittgenstein sought understand and hence philosophical using formal logic formalize the way which philosophical statements are ludwig wittgenstein developed comprehensive system logical atomism his tractatus philosophicus thereby argued that the world the totality actual states affairs and that these states affairs can expressed the language order predicate thus picture the world can construed means expressing atomic facts the form atomic and linking them using logical operators logical positivism logical positivism during the late and russell and formalism was developed group philosophers vienna and who were known the vienna circle and berlin circle respectively into doctrine known logical positivism logical logical positivism used formal logical methods develop empiricist account philosophers such rudolf carnap and hans reichenbach along with other members the vienna circle claimed that the truths logic and mathematics were tautologies and those science were verifiable empirical these two constituted the entire universe meaningful anything else was the claims aesthetics and theology accordingly pseudo neither true nor simply karl popper insistence upon the role falsification the philosophy science was reaction the logical with the coming power adolf hitler and national socialism germany and many members the vienna and berlin circles fled germany most commonly britain and which helped reinforce the dominance logical positivism and analytic philosophy the anglophone logical positivists typically considered philosophy having very limited for philosophy concerned the clarification rather than having distinct subject matter its the positivists adopted the verification principle according which every meaningful statement either analytic capable being verified this caused the logical positivists reject many traditional problems especially those metaphysics ontology ordinary language analysis ordinary language philosophy after world war during the late and analytic philosophy took turn toward ordinary language analysis this movement had two main one followed the wake later which departed dramatically from his early work the tractatus the known oxford involved austin contrast earlier analytic philosophers including the early who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings natural language constructing ideal ordinary language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represented large number subtle distinctions that had been unrecognized the formulation traditional philosophical theories while schools such logical positivism emphasize logical supposed universal and separate from contingent factors such language historical ordinary language philosophy emphasizes the use language ordinary the known ordinary language philosophers during the were austin and gilbert ryle ordinary language philosophy often sought dissolve philosophical problems showing them the result misunderstanding ordinary see for example ryle who attempted dispose descartes myth and among contemporary analytic philosophy although contemporary philosophers who identify analytic have widely divergent assumptions and and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined the analytic movement before analytic its contemporary usually taken defined particular style characterized precision and thoroughness about narrow and resistance imprecise cavalier discussions broad the logical positivism was influentially challenged wittgenstein the philosophical investigations quine two dogmas empiricism and sellars empiricism and the philosophy mind following anglophone philosophy began incorporate wider range views and still many philosophers britain and america still consider themselves analytic largely they have done expanding the notion analytic from the specific programs that dominated anglophone philosophy before much more general notion analytic style this interpretation the history far from universally and its opponents would say that grossly downplays the role wittgenstein the sixties and many philosophers and historians have attempted define describe analytic those definitions often include focus conceptual martinich draws analogy between analytic interest conceptual analysis and analytic which aims determining chemical steven hales described analytic philosophy one three types philosophical method practiced the roughly reverse order number they are ideological and analytic scott soames agrees that clarity analytic has implicit albeit faltering and the ideals rigor and and aims truth and opposed moral spiritual improvement the goal analytic philosophy discover what not provide useful recipe for living soames also states that analytic philosophy characterised more piecemeal there widespread presumption within the tradition that often possible make philosophical progress intensively investigating circumscribed range philosophical issues while holding systematic questions few the most important and active fields and subfields analytic philosophy are summarized the following philosophy mind and cognitive science philosophy mind motivated the logical interest logical behaviorism was the most prominent theory mind analytic philosophy for the first half the twentieth behaviorists tended hold either that statements about the mind were equivalent statements about behavior and dispositions behave particular ways that mental states were directly equivalent behavior and dispositions behaviorism later became far less favor type physicalism functionalism theories that identified mental states with brain during this topics the philosophy mind were often close contact with issues cognitive science such modularity innateness finally analytic philosophy has featured few philosophers who were dualists and recently forms property dualism have had with david chalmers the most prominent john searle suggests that the obsession with the philosophy language the last century has been superseded emphasis the philosophy mind which functionalism currently the dominant recent central focus for research the philosophy mind has been consciousness and while there general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model there are many views how the specifics work the best known theories are daniel dennett heterophenomenology fred dretske and michael representationalism and the order theories either david rosenthal who advocates order thought model david armstrong and william lycan who advocate order perception model alternative order the order global states model offered robert van gulick ethics analytic philosophy ethics philosophers working the analytic tradition have gradually come distinguish three major branches moral meta ethics whose function the investigation moral terms and concepts normative ethics whose function the examination and production normative ethical judgments applied ethics whose function the investigation how existing normative principles should applied difficult borderline often cases created the appearance new technologies new scientific normative ethics the first half the twentieth century was marked skepticism and neglect normative related such social and political aesthetics and philosophy history moved the fringes language philosophy during this during this utilitarianism was the only skeptical approach ethics remain however the influence logical positivism began wane contemporary analytic philosophers began have renewed interest anscombe modern moral philosophy sparked revival aristotle virtue ethical approach and john theory justice restored interest kantian ethical contemporary normative ethics dominated three utilitarianism virtue ethics and deontology meta ethics twentieth century ethics has two the first moore investigation into the nature ethical terms good his principia ethica which identified the naturalistic fallacy along with famous ought the naturalistic fallacy was central point investigation for analytical the second logical positivism and its attitude that statements which are unverifiable are although that attitude was adopted originally means promote scientific investigation the world rejecting grand metaphysical had the side effect making ethical and value judgments well religious statements and meaningless but since value judgments are obviously major importance human became incumbent logical positivism develop explanation the nature and meaning value analytic philosophers avoided normative and instead began meta ethical investigations into the nature moral statements and the logical positivists held that statements about value including all ethical and aesthetic are non cognitive that they make statements that can objectively verified instead the logical positivists adopted emotivist position which held that value judgments expressed the attitude the saying killing they was equivalent boo saying the word murder with particular tone while cognitivism was generally accepted analytic emotivism had many and evolved into more sophisticated cognitivist positions such the expressivism charles stevenson and the universal prescriptivism hare which had its foundations austin philosophy speech acts these positions were not without their phillipa foot contributed several essays attacking all these urmson article called the ought distinction into the ought and the naturalistic fallacy began called into analytic philosophers began show renewed interest the traditional questions moral perhaps most influential this area was elizabeth anscombe whose landmark monograph intention was called donald davidson the most important treatment action since and widely regarded masterpiece moral favorite student and close friend ludwig her article modern moral introduced the term consequentialism into the philosophical declared the impasse dead and led revival virtue applied ethics significant feature analytic philosophy since approximately has been the emergence applied ethics interest the application moral principles specific practical areas special interest for applied ethics include environmental issues animal rights issues and the many challenges created advancing medical science analytic philosophy religion philosophy religion analytic philosophy religion harris noted that analytic philosophy has been very heterogeneous some forms analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic the philosophy religion and have actually provided philosophical mechanism for responding other more radical and hostile forms analytic with the study early analytic philosophy tended avoid the study philosophy religion largely dismissing per the logical view the subject part metaphysics and therefore the collapse logical positivism renewed interest philosophy prompting philosophers like william alston john mackie alvin plantinga robert merrihew adams richard swinburne and antony flew not only introduce new but open classical topics such the nature miracles theistic the problem evil see existence god the rationality belief god concepts the nature and many plantinga mackie and flew debated the logical validity the free will defense way solve the problem alston grappling with the consequences analytic philosophy language worked the nature religious adams worked the relationship faith and analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for number sophisticated theistic like those the reformed epistemologists like analytic philosophy religion has also been preoccupied with ludwig wittgenstein well his interpretation ren kierkegaard philosophy using hand remarks which was later published philosophical investigations culture and value and other philosophers such peter winch and norman malcolm developed what has come known contemplative philosophy wittgensteinian school thought rooted the swansea and which includes wittgensteinians such rush rhees peter and phillips among the name contemplative was first coined phillips philosophy cool place which rests interpretation passage from culture and this interpretation was first wittgensteinian kai nielsen but those who consider themselves wittgensteinians the swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal caricature considered this especially true phillips responding this kai nielsen and phillips became two the most prominent philosophers philosophy political philosophy liberalism current analytic political philosophy owes much john rawls who series papers from the onward most notably two concepts and justice and his book theory justice produced sophisticated and closely argued defence broadly liberal egalitarian account distributive this was followed short order colleague robert nozick book anarchy state and utopia defence free market libertarianism isaiah berlin also had lasting influence both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture the two concepts liberty recent decades have also seen the rise several critiques including the feminist critiques catharine mackinnon and andrea dworkin the communitarian critiques michael sandel and alasdair macintyre though should noted both shy away from the and the multiculturalist critiques amy gutmann and charles taylor although not analytic rgen habermas another figure contemporary analytic political whose social theory blend social marxism neo kantianism and american pragmatism consequentialist libertarianism also derives from the analytic analytical marxism another development the area political philosophy has been the emergence school known analytical marxism members this school seek apply the techniques analytic along with tools modern social science such rational choice theory the elucidation the theories karl marx and his the known member this school cohen whose work karl theory defence generally taken representing the genesis this that cohen applied the tools logical and linguistic analysis the elucidation and defense materialist conception other prominent analytical marxists include the economist john roemer the social scientist jon elster and the sociologist erik olin wright the work these later philosophers have furthered work bringing bear modern social science such rational choice supplement use analytic philosophical techniques the interpretation marxian cohen himself would later engage directly with rawlsian political philosophy advance socialist theory justice that stands contrast both traditional marxism and the theories advanced rawls and points principle from each according his each according his need communitarianism communitarians such alasdair macintyre charles taylor michael walzer and michael sandel advance critique liberalism that uses analytic techniques isolate the key assumptions liberal such and then challenges these communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can viewed fully autonomous from the community which lives and brought instead they push for conception the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays shaping his her thought processes and analytic metaphysics metaphysics one striking break with early analytic philosophy was the revival metaphysical theorizing the second half the twentieth philosophers such david kellogg lewis and david armstrong developed elaborate theories range topics such causation possibility and and abstract among the developments that led the revival metaphysical theorizing were quine attack the analytic synthetic distinction which was generally taken undermine carnap distinction between existence questions internal framework and those external important also for the revival metaphysics was the further development modal logic including the work saul kripke who argued naming and necessity and elsewhere for the existence essences and the possibility necessary posteriori truths metaphysics remains fertile area for having recovered from the attacks ayer and the logical positivists and though many discussions are continuations old inherited from previous decades and the debate remains the philosophy the problem empty and the debate over status property have all risen out relative obscurity become central while perennial issues such free possible and the philosophy time have had new life breathed into science has also played increasingly significant role the theory special relativity has had profound effect the philosophy and quantum physics routinely discussed the free will the weight given scientific evidence largely due widespread commitments among philosophers scientific realism and naturalism philosophy language philosophy language philosophy language another area that has slowed down over the course the last four evidenced the fact that few major figures contemporary philosophy treat primary research indeed while the debate remains still strongly under the influence those figures from the first half the gottlob frege bertrand russell ludwig wittgenstein austin alfred tarski and quine naming and necessity kripke influentially argued that flaws common theories proper names are indicative larger misunderstandings the metaphysics necessity and wedding the tools modal logic causal theory kripke was widely regarded reviving theories essence and identity respectable topics philosophical another influential pavel founded transparent intensional original theory the logical analysis natural languages the theory devoted the problem saying exactly what that know and can communicate when come understand what sentence philosophy science philosophy science reacting against both the verificationism the logical positivists the one and the philosopher science karl popper who had suggested the falsifiability criterion which judge the demarcation between science and discussions philosophy science the last forty years were dominated social constructivist and cognitive relativist theories thomas samuel kuhn with his formulation paradigm shifts and paul feyerabend with his epistemological anarchism are significant figures these the philosophy biology has also undergone considerable particularly due the considerable debate recent years over the nature evolution particularly natural selection daniel dennett and his book darwin dangerous idea which defends neo darwinism stand the foreground this epistemology epistemology owing largely gettier paper justified true belief epistemology saw resurgence within analytic philosophy over the last years large portion current epistemological research aims resolve the problems that examples presented the traditional justified true belief model including developing theories justification order deal with giving alternatives the justified true belief other and related areas contemporary research include debates between internalism and externalism basic the nature evidence the value epistemic luck virtue epistemology the role intuitions and treating knowledge primitive aesthetics aesthetics the wake attacks the traditional aesthetic notions beauty and sublimity from post modern thinkers analytic philosophers were slow taking analyses art and aesthetic susanne langer and nelson goodman addressed these problems analytic style the and since aesthetics discipline for analytic philosophers has rigorous efforts pursue analyses traditional aesthetic concepts were undertaken guy sircello the and resulting new analytic theories sublimity and see also continental philosophy postanalytic philosophy scientism
