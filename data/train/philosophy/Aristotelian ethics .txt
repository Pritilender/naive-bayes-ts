references further reading external links three ethical treatises three aristotelian ethical works survive today which are considered either from relatively soon nicomachean ethics abbreviated the sometimes from the latin version the the the books and the most widely read ethical eudemian ethics often abbreviated the magna moralia often abbreviated the the exact origins these texts although they were already considered the works aristotle ancient textual oddities suggest that they may not have been put their current form aristotle for books eudemian ethics also appear books vii nicomachean ethics the authenticity the magna moralia has been whereas almost modern scholar doubts that aristotle wrote the nicomachean ethics and the eudemian ethics himself even editor also played some part giving those texts their current the nicomachean ethics has received the most scholarly and the most easily available modern readers many different translations and some critics consider the eudemian ethics less while such kenny contend that the eudemian ethics the more and therefore work traditionally was believed that the nicomachean ethics and the eudemian ethics were either edited dedicated son and pupil nicomachus and his disciple respectively although the works themselves not explain the source their although father was also called aristotle son was the next leader the lyceum and ancient times was already associated with this fourth aristotle politics often regarded the sequel the part because aristotle closes the nicomachean ethics saying that his ethical inquiry has laid the groundwork for inquiry into political questions aristotle ethics also states that the good the individual subordinate the good the polis fragments also survive from protrepticus another work which dealt with aristotle socratic some scholars regarded aristotle socratic citation needed aristotle ethics builds upon earlier greek particularly that his teacher plato and socrates while socrates left written and plato wrote dialogues and few aristotle wrote treatises which sets forth philosophical doctrines more aristotle did write but they unfortunately survive only according aristotle his metaphysics socrates was the first greek philosopher concentrate although apparently did not give this philosophical inquiry concerning how people should best aristotle dealt with this same question but giving two the and the both with politics being the name for the two together the more important the original socratic questioning ethics started least partly response sophism which was popular style education and speech the sophism emphasized rhetoric and and therefore often involved criticism traditional greek religion and flirtation with moral relativism aristotle study built around the premise that people should achieve excellent character virtuous ethik aret condition for attaining happiness being eudaimonia sometimes referred comparison later ethical theories character based like plato and socrates emphasized the importance reason for human and that there were logical and natural reasons for humans behave and try become aristotle treatment the subject distinct several ways from that found socratic aristotle presentation obviously different from because does not write dialogues but treatises apart from this aristotle explicitly stated that his presentation was different from because started from whatever could agreed upon well and not from any attempt develop general theory what makes anything explained that was necessary not aim too much accuracy the starting point any discussion with controversial matters such those concerning what just what from this starting point built similar theoretical conclusions concerning the importance intellectual virtue and contemplative rather than discussing only four cardinal virtues plato courage temperance justice and prudence all three the ethical starts with courage and temperance the two typical moral virtues which can described then discusses whole range minor virtues and vices which can described and only then discusses justice and the intellectual aristotle places prudence phron sis often translated practical amongst these intellectual like plato eventually says that all the highest forms the moral virtues require each and all require intellectual and effect that the happiest and most virtuous life that aristotle emphasizes throughout all his analyses virtues that they aim what beautiful kalos effectively equating the good least for with the beautiful kalon aristotle analysis ethics makes use his metaphysical theory potentiality and actuality defines happiness terms this theory actuality energeia the virtues which allow happiness and enjoyment the best and most constant are stable dispositions hexeis which are developed through and this pleasure turn another actuality that compliments the actuality happy practical ethics aristotle believed that ethical knowledge not only theoretical knowledge but rather that person must have experience the actions and have been brought fine become good and for person become simply study what virtue but must actually virtuous starting point the aristotelian ethics all aim begin with approximate but uncontroversial starting the nicomachean ethics aristotle says explicitly that one must begin with what familiar and the the fact ancient commentators agree that aristotle means here that his treatise must rely upon everyday knowledge virtuous actions the starting points his and that supposing that his readers will have some kind experienced understanding such and value noble and just actions least some elsewhere aristotle also seems rely upon common conceptions how the world some regard his ethical inquiries using method that relies upon popular opinion his called endoxic from the endoxa there some however about exactly how such common conceptions fit into method his ethical particularly since also makes use more formal especially the called function which described aristotle describes popular accounts about what life would happy dividing into three most common life dedicated vulgar life dedicated fame and life dedicated contemplation reach his own conclusion about the best however aristotle tries isolate the function the argument develops here accordingly widely known the function and among the discussed arguments made any ancient argues that while humans undergo nutrition and other living and while humans are capable this shared with animals thus neither these characteristics particular according what remains and what distinctively human thus concludes that the human function some kind excellent exercise the and since aristotle thinks that practical wisdom rules over the character exercising such excellences one way exercise reason and thus fulfill the human one common objection function argument that uses descriptive factual premises derive conclusions about what such arguments are often thought run afoul the ought gap moral virtue moral excellence the disposition grk hexis act which person develops partly result his and partly result his habit aristotle develops his analysis character book the nicomachean ethics where makes this argument that character arises from likening ethical character skill that acquired through such learning musical book iii the nicomachean ethics aristotle argues that character since results from many individual actions which are under his voluntary aristotle also claims that each specific character excellence lies between excess and each which different vice that deviates some way from the virtuous character for the man who gets angry too easily but the man who does not get angry easily enough this called doctrine the one the known aspects aristotle himself still possible extremely but what this actually means extremely close the also mistake suppose that the mean some mechanical average the excess and for aristotle thinks that knowingly going death sometimes the right thing but such action not moderate the usual sense that aristotle distinguishes the disposition feel emotions certain kind from virtue and but such emotional dispositions may also lie mean between two and these are also some extent result bringing and two examples such dispositions would tendency feel which aristotle discusses and righteous indignation nemesis which balanced feeling sympathetic pain concerning the undeserved pleasures and pains exactly which habitual dispositions are virtues vices and which only concern differs between the different works which have but the basic examples are the basis for distinguishing them some despite intending the right cannot act according their own for someone may choose refrain from eating chocolate but finds himself eating the cake contrary his own such failure act way that consistent with own decision called akrasia and may translated weakness incontinence lack justice aristotle devotes book the nicomachean ethics justice this also book the eudemian ethics this aristotle defines justice having two different but related general justice and particular general justice virtue expressed relation other thus the just man this sense deals properly and fairly with and expresses his virtue his dealings with not lying cheating taking from others what owed particular justice the correct distribution just deserts for such justice has with people receiving what proportional their merit their his discussion particular aristotle says educated judge needed apply just decisions regarding any particular this where get the image the scales the blindfolded judge symbolizing blind balancing the weighing all the evidence and deliberating each particular case the highest good his ethical aristotle describes eudaimonia the highest human book the nicomachean ethics goes identify eudaimonia the excellent exercise the leaving open citation needed whether means practical activity intellectual with respect practical order exercise any one the practical excellences the highest person must possess all the aristotle therefore describes several apparently different kinds virtuous person necessarily having all the moral excellences being great magnanimity the virtue where someone would truly deserving the highest praise and have correct attitude towards the honor this may this the first such case mentioned the nicomachean ethics being just the true this the type justice fairness good ruler good phronesis practical shown good the virtue being truly good having the nobility kalokagathia aristotle also for example book that such complete virtue requires intellectual not only practical but also theoretical such virtuous they can come into will choose the most pleasant and happy life which the philosophical life contemplation and aristotle claims that highest functioning must include being good what sets humans apart from everything aristotle explains the function man activity soul accordance with least not without identifies two different ways which the soul can reasoning both practical and and following reasoning person that does this the happiest

nicomachean ethics aquinas also departed from aristotle certain his summa theologica argued that eudaimonia human flourishing was held temporary goal for this but perfect happiness the ultimate goal could only attained the next life the aquinas also added new theological virtues were added faith hope and and supernatural assistance could help people achieve nevertheless much ethical thought remained intact modern aristotle writings ethics remain among the most influential his broad along with the and the while his scientific writings tend viewed more strictly historical modern science develops theories about the physical world based experiments and careful the basis exact measurements time and aristotle the other bases his science largely qualitative and experimental accordingly
