atomism from greek atomon uncuttable indivisible natural philosophy that developed several ancient the atomists theorized that nature consists two fundamental atom and void unlike their modern scientific namesake atomic theory philosophical atoms come infinite variety shapes and each immutable and surrounded void where they collide with the others hook together forming clusters different arrangements and positions give rise the various macroscopic substances the references the concept atomism and its atoms are found ancient india and ancient greece india the jain ajivika and carvaka schools atomism may date back the century the nyaya and vaisheshika schools later developed theories how atoms combined into more complex the atomism emerged the century bce with leucippus and democritus whether indian culture influenced greek vice versa whether both evolved independently matter the particles chemical matter for which chemists and other natural philosophers the early century found experimental evidence were thought and therefore were given the name atom long used the atomist however the the atoms the chemists were found composed even smaller electrons neutrons and protons and further experiments showed that protons and neutrons are made quarks although the connection historical atomism best elementary particles have thus become modern analog philosophical despite the misnomer contents reductionism greek atomism geometry and atoms the rejection atoms later ancient atomism atomism and ethics indian atomism nyaya vaisesika school buddhist school jaina school time explained srimad bhagavatam islamic atomism asharite atomism averroism medieval european speculations scholastic minima naturalia atomic renaissance corpuscularianism atomic theory atomic theory controversy see also notes references external links reductionism philosophical atomism reductive argument not only that everything composed atoms and but that nothing they compose really the only things that really exist are atoms ricocheting off each other mechanistically otherwise empty atomism stands contrast substance theory wherein prime material continuum remains qualitatively invariant under division for the ratio the four classical elements would the same any portion homogeneous indian buddhists such dharmakirti and also developed distinctive theories for involving momentary atoms that flash and out existence kalapas greek atomism the century leucippus and his pupil democritus proposed that all matter was composed small indivisible particles called order reconcile two conflicting schools thought the nature one side was heraclitus who believed that the nature all existence the other side was parmenides who believed instead that all change parmenides denied the existence change and believed all existence all encompassing and unchanging mass concept known monism and that change and motion were mere this well the reasoning that lead may indeed seem baffling the modern empirical but parmenides explicitly rejected sensory experience the path understanding the and instead used purely abstract firstly believed there such thing equating with being the void then not therefore not the this turn meant that motion because there void move also wrote all that must indivisible for were then there would have void that could divide and did not believe the void finally stated that the all encompassing unity for the unity already encompasses all that and can democritus accepted most arguments except for the idea that change believed change was and was not then least the illusion had thus supported the concept and stated that the universe made many parmenidean entities that move around the the void infinite and provides the space which the atoms can pack scatter the different possible packings and scatterings within the void make the shifting outlines and bulk the objects that organisms see eat hear smell and while organisms may feel hot hot and cold actually have real they are simply sensations produced organisms the different packings and scatterings the atoms the void that compose the object that organisms sense being hot the work democritus only survives secondhand some which are unreliable much the best evidence theory atomism reported aristotle his discussions and contrasting views the types indivisibles composing the natural geometry and atoms fire tetrahedron animation air octahedron animation water icosahedron animation earth cube animation geometrical simple bodies according plato plato were familiar with the atomism would have objected its mechanistic materialism argued that atoms just crashing into other atoms could never produce the beauty and form the timaeus the character timeaus insisted that the cosmos was not eternal but was although its creator framed after unchanging one part that creation were the four simple bodies air water and but plato did not consider these corpuscles the most basic level for his view they were made unchanging level which was these simple bodies were geometric solids the faces which made the square faces the cube were each made four isosceles angled triangles and the triangular faces the octahedron and icosahedron were each made six angled postulated the geometric structure the simple bodies the four elements summarized the table the the with its flat base and was assigned the tetrahedron was assigned fire because its penetrating points and sharp edges made the points and edges the octahedron and icosahedron were blunter and these less mobile bodies were assigned air and since the simple bodies could decomposed into and the triangles reassembled into atoms different plato model offered plausible account changes among the primary the rejection atoms sometime before aristotle asserted that the elements air earth and water were not made but were aristotle considered the existence which was required atomic violate physical change took place not the rearrangement atoms make new but transformation matter from what was potential new this theory called hylomorphism piece wet when acted upon takes its potential actual drinking aristotle has often been criticized for rejecting but ancient greece the atomic theories democritus remained pure incapable being put any experimental granted that atomism the long prove far more fruitful than any qualitative theory the short run the theory that aristotle proposed must have seemed some respects more unbalanced opinion later ancient atomism epicurus studied atomism with nausiphanes who had been student although epicurus was certain the existence atoms and the was less sure could adequately explain specific natural phenomena such lightning comets the phases the moon lloyd few writings survive and those that reflect his interest applying theories assist people taking responsibility for themselves and for their own since held there are gods around that can help understood role moral his ideas are also represented the works his follower lucretius who wrote the nature things this scientific work poetic form illustrates several segments epicurean theory how the universe came into its current stage and shows that the phenomena perceive are actually composite the atoms and the void are eternal and constant atomic collisions create which are still composed the same eternal atoms whose motion for while incorporated into the created human sensations and meteorological phenomena are also explained lucretius terms atomic atomism and ethics some later philosophers attributed the idea that man created the gods did not create man for sextus empiricus noted three hundred years after lucretius his epic poem the nature things would depict him the hero who crushed the monster religion through educating the people what was possible the atoms and what was not possible the however epicurus expressed aggressive attitude characterized his the man who best knows how meet external threats makes into one family all the creatures and those can any rate does not treat and where finds even this avoids all and far excludes them from his indian atomism the indian atomistic like many movements indian philosophy and starts with argument from the vedic etymologist and grammarian yaska century his dealing with models for how linguistic structures get have their takes the atomistic position that words are the primary carrier meaning words have preferred ontological status defining this position was the subject fierce debate the indian tradition from the early christian era till the involving different philosophers from the nyaya mimamsa and buddhist schools the pratishakhya text century the gist the controversy was stated cryptically the sutra form samhita according the atomist the words pada would the primary elements prakrti out which the sentence while the holistic view considers the sentence the primary originally given its context and the words are arrived only through analysis and these two positions came called paksha indivisibility position developed later bhartrihari kshanda paksha position adopted the mimamsa and nyaya schools kshanda fragmented whole between the and centuries the atom anu mentioned the bhagavad gita chapter verse kavi pur ram sam anusmared sarvasya ram pam tamasa parast one meditates the primordial the smaller than the yet the maintainer whose form resplendent like the sun and totally transcendental material nature the ancient doctrine which held that elements are also suggestive possible starting point for atomism gangopadhyaya there has been some debate among scholars the origin indian the general consensus that the indian and greek versions atomism developed however there some doubt given the similarities between indian atomism and greek atomism and the proximity india scholastic well the related diogenes laertius democritus making acquaintance with the gymnosophists india the atomist position had transcended language into epistemology the time that nyaya vaisesika buddhist and jaina theology were developing mature philosophical will durant wrote our oriental heritage two systems indian thought propound physical theories suggestively similar those greece kanada founder the vaisheshika philosophy held that the world was composed atoms many kind the various the jains more nearly approximated democritus teaching that all atoms were the same producing different effects diverse modes kanada believed light and heat varieties the same udayana taught that all heat comes from the and vachaspati like interpreted light composed minute particles emitted substances and striking the indian atomism the middle ages was still mostly philosophical religious though was also because the infallible vedas the oldest hindu not mention atoms though they mention atomism was not orthodox many schools hindu although accommodationist interpretations assumptions lost text justified the use atomism for orthodox schools hindu the buddhist and jaina schools atomism were more willing accept the ideas nyaya vaisesika school nyaya vaisesika the nyaya vaisesika school developed one the earliest forms scholars date the nyaya and vaisesika texts from the centuries like the buddhist the vaisesika had aristotelian theory they posited the four elemental atom but vaisesika physics atoms had different possible divided between general extensive properties and specific properties like the jaina the vaisesika atomists had elaborate theories how atoms both jaina and vaisesika atoms first combine pairs and then group into trios pairs which are the smallest visible units buddhist school buddhist atomism the buddhist atomists had very aristotelian style atomic according ancient buddhist which probably began developing before the century there are four kinds corresponding the standard each these elements has specific such solidity and performs specific function such providing support causing like the hindu the buddhists were able integrate theory atomism with their theological later indian buddhist such dharmakirti and dign considered atoms durationless and made jaina school jain cosmology dravya karma jainism the most elaborate and preserved indian theory atomism comes from the philosophy the jaina school dating back least the century some the jain texts that refer matter and atoms are pancastikayasara kalpasutra tattvarthasutra and pannavana the jains envisioned the world consisting wholly except for param atoms were considered the basic building blocks all their concept atoms was very similar classical differing primarily the specific properties each according jain philosophy has one kind one one and two kinds though unclear what was meant kind atoms can exist one two subtle which case they can fit infinitesimally small and which case they have extension and occupy finite certain characteristics correspond with that atomic for example characterized continuous motion either straight line case attractions from other follows curved this corresponds with the description orbit electrons across the ultimate particles are also described particles with positive snigdha smooth and negative ksa rough charges that provide them the binding although atoms are made the same basic they can combine based their eternal properties produce any six aggregates which seem correspond with the greek concept elements earth water shadow sense karmic and unfit the karma was but was mechanistic phenomenon caused buildups subtle karmic matter within the they also had detailed theories how atoms could react vibrate move and perform other all which were thoroughly time explained srimad bhagavatam the material ultimate which indivisible and not formed into called the atom parama exists always invisible even after the dissolution all the material body but combination such but misunderstood the common atoms are the ultimate state the manifest when they stay their own forms without forming different they are called the unlimited there are certainly different bodies physical but the atoms themselves form the complete one can estimate time measuring the movement the atomic combination time the potency the almighty personality hari who controls all physical movement although not visible the physical the division gross time calculated two atoms make one double and three double atoms make one this hexatom visible the sunshine which enters through the holes window one can clearly see that the hexatom goes towards the the atom described invisible but when six such atoms combine they are called trasare and this visible the sunshine pouring through the holes window excerpted from srimad bhagavatam bhaktivedanta swami courtesy the bhaktivedanta book trust international prabhupadabooks com islamic atomism early islamic atomism alchemy and chemistry medieval islam atomistic philosophies are found very early islamic philosophy and was influenced earlier greek and some extent indian like both the greek and indian islamic atomism was charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious but was instead more often favoured orthodox islamic theologians was such fertile and flexible idea greece and flourished some leading schools islamic asharite atomism ash ari the most successful form islamic atomism was the asharite school islamic theology most notably the work the theologian ghazali asharite atomism atoms are the only material things and all else the world accidental meaning something that lasts for only nothing accidental can the cause anything except exists for contingent events are not subject natural physical but are the direct result constant without which nothing could thus nature completely dependent which meshes with other asharite islamic ideas the lack thereof gardet ghazali also used the theory support his theory occasionalism the asharite theory atomism has far more common with indian atomism than does with greek averroism averroism other traditions islam rejected the atomism the asharites and expounded many greek especially those active school philosophers including the noted commentator averroes explicitly rejected the thought ghazali and turned extensive evaluation the thought averroes commented detail most the works aristotle and his commentaries did much guide the interpretation aristotle later jewish and christian scholastic medieval european speculations while aristotelian philosophy eclipsed the importance the atomists late roman and medieval their work was still preserved and exposited through commentaries the works the galen presented extensive discussions the greek especially his aristotle according historian atomism joshua there was serious work done with atomism from the time galen until gassendi and descartes resurrected the the gap between these two modern and the ancient atomists marked the exile the and universally admitted that the middle ages had abandoned and virtually lost however although the ancient works were scholastic thinkers still had critiques the medieval universities there were expressions for the century nicholas autrecourt considered that space and time were all made indivisible points and instants and that all generation and corruption took place the rearrangement material the similarities his ideas with those ghazali suggest that nicholas may have been familiar with perhaps through averroes refutation scholastic minima naturalia minima naturalia although the atomism epicurus had fallen out favor the centuries scholasticism related aristotelian that minima naturalia natural received extensive minima naturalia were theorized aristotle the smallest parts into which homogeneous natural substance flesh bone could divided and still retain its essential speculation minima naturalia provided philosophical background for the mechanistic philosophy early modern thinkers like and for the alchemical works geber and daniel sennert who turn influenced the corpuscularian alchemist robert boyle one the founders modern unlike the atomism leucippus democritus and epicurus and also unlike the later atomic theory john dalton the aristotelian natural minimum was not conceptualized physically atomic the contemporary instead the concept was rooted hylomorphic worldview which held that every physical thing compound matter greek hyle and immaterial substantial form greek morphe that imparts its essential nature and for rubber ball for hylomorphist like aristotle would rubber structured spherical shape aristotle intuition was that there some smallest size beyond which matter could longer structured some other such organic substance that for living before the could considered for flesh were divided beyond its natural what would left might large amount the element and smaller amounts the other but whatever water other elements were they would longer have the nature hylomorphic they would longer matter structured the form instead the remaining would matter structured the form not the form this suggestive modern bar gold can continually divided until one has single atom but further division yields only subatomic particles quarks etc which are longer however the parallel not minima naturalia are not direct anticipation modern chemical and physical chief theme late roman and scholastic commentary this concept reconciling minima naturalia with the general aristotelian principle infinite commentators like john philoponus and thomas aquinas reconciled these aspects thought distinguishing between mathematical and natural divisibility with few much the curriculum the universities europe was based such aristotelianism for most the middle ages kargon scholasticism was standard science the time isaac newton but the renewed interest epicurean atomism and corpuscularianism hybrid alternative aristotelian physics had begun mount outside the atomic renaissance the main figures the rebirth atomism were ren descartes pierre gassendi and robert boyle well other notable one the first groups atomists england was cadre amateur scientists known the northumberland led henry percy the earl northumberland although they published little they helped disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture and may have been particularly influential francis bacon who became atomist around though later rejected some the claims though they revived the classical form this group was among the scientific the northumberland circle contained nearly half the confirmed copernicans prior the year the starry messenger other influential atomists late and early centuries include giordano bruno thomas hobbes who also changed his stance atomism late his and thomas hariot number different atomistic theories were blossoming france this well clericuzio galileo galilei was advocate atomism his discourse floating bodies redondi the galileo offered more complete physical system based corpuscular theory which all with the exception are produced matter galileo identified some basic problems with aristotelian physics through his utilized theory atomism partial but was never unequivocally committed for his experiments with falling bodies and inclined planes led him the concepts circular inertial motion and accelerating the current aristotelian theories impetus and terrestrial motion were inadequate explain while atomism did not explain the law fall either was more promising framework which develop explanation because motion was conserved ancient atomism unlike aristotelian ren descartes mechanical philosophy corpuscularism had much common with and some different version descartes thought everything physical the universe made tiny vortices like the ancient descartes claimed that such taste are caused the shape and size tiny pieces the main difference between atomism and concept was the existence the for there could and all matter was constantly swirling prevent void corpuscles moved through other another key distinction between view and classical atomism the mind body duality which allowed for independent realm existence for soul and most god gassendi concept was closer classical but with atheistic pierre gassendi was catholic priest from france who was also avid natural was particularly intrigued the greek set out purify atomism from its heretical and atheistic philosophical conclusions dijksterhius gassendi formulated his atomistic conception mechanical philosophy partly response particularly opposed reductionist view that only purely mechanical explanations physics are well the application geometry the whole physics clericuzio corpuscularianism corpuscularianism corpuscularianism similar except that where atoms were supposed corpuscles could principle this for was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner step the way towards transmutative production corpuscularianism was associated its leading proponents with the idea that some the properties that objects appear have are artifacts the perceiving qualities distinguished from qualities not all corpuscularianism made use the secondary quality however influential tradition medieval and early modern alchemy argued that chemical analysis revealed the existence robust corpuscles that retained their identity chemical compounds use the modern william newman has dubbed this approach matter theory chymical and has argued for its significance both the mechanical philosophy and the chemical atomism that emerged the early corpuscularianism stayed dominant theory over the next several hundred years and retained its links with alchemy the work scientists such robert boyle and isaac newton the was used for his development the corpuscular theory light the form that came accepted most english scientists after robert boyle was amalgam the systems descartes and the sceptical chymist boyle demonstrates problems that arise from and offers atomism possible the unifying principle that would eventually lead the acceptance hybrid atomism was mechanical philosophy which became widely accepted physical sciences atomic theory atomic theory the late the useful practices engineering and technology began influence philosophical explanations for the composition those who speculated the ultimate nature matter began verify their thought with some repeatable demonstrations when they roger boscovich provided the first general mathematical theory based the ideas newton and leibniz but transforming them provide programme for atomic john dalton assimilated the known experimental work many people summarize the empirical evidence the composition noticed that distilled water everywhere analyzed the same hydrogen and oxygen similarly other purified substances decomposed the same elements the same proportions furthermore concluded that there was unique atom for each using lavoisier definition element substance that could not analyzed into something thus dalton concluded the analysis synthesis and then proceeded give list relative weights the compositions several common summarizing water ammonia nitrogen dalton concluded that the fixed proportions elements weight suggested that the atoms one element combined with only limited number atoms the other elements form the substances that atomic theory controversy dalton atomic theory remained controversial throughout the whilst the law definite proportion were the hypothesis that this was due atoms was not widely for example when sir humphry davy presented dalton the royal medal from the royal society davy said that the theory only became useful when the atomic conjecture was sir benjamin collins brodie published the first part his calculus chemical operations non atomic alternative the atomic described atomic theory thoroughly materialistic bit joiners alexander williamson used his presidential address the london chemical society defend the atomic theory against its critics and this turn led further meetings which the positivists again attacked the supposition that there were the matter was finally resolved favour the early century with the rise atomic physics see also becoming history chemistry infinite divisibility ontological pluralism physical ontology
