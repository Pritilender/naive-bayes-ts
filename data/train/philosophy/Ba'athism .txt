history the origins athism began with the political thought developed zaki arsuzi and michel aflaq while bitar and arsuzi were never members the same they are considered the founders the closest they ever came being members the same organization was when those three together with michel quzman shakir and ilyas qandalaft tried establish the reason being that arsuzi personally disliked and aflaq seemed have reciprocated the arsuzi formed the arab ath party and his views influenced aflaq alongside junior partner salah din bitar founded the arab ihya movement that later renamed itself the arab ath movement though aflaq was influenced arsuzi initially did not cooperate with arsuzi suspected that the existence the arab ihya which occasionally titled itself arab during was part imperialist

socialist party led akram hawrani establish the arab socialist ath the ath movement split one syrian dominated and one iraqi dominated consequence the split was that arsuzi took place the official father athist thought the syrian ath while the iraqi ath movement aflaq was still considered the jure father athist definition aflaq today considered the founder the athist movement its most notable there were other notable ideologues such arsuzi and salah din bitar from the founding the arab ath movement until the syria and the early the ideology the ath party was largely synonymous with that aflaq view arab nationalism considered such historian paul romantic and intellectual aflaq recast the conservative arab nationalist thoughts and changed them reflect strong revolutionary and progressive tendency which developed harmony alongside the decolonisation and other events which happened the arab world the time his insisted the overthrow the old ruling and supported the creation secular society separating islam from the not all these ideas were but was aflaq who succeeded turning these believes into transnational the core basis athism arab socialism socialism with arab characteristics which not associated with international socialist and pan arab ideology developed aflaq and was unique wing centric the ideology presented itself representing the arab spirit against materialistic communism and arab history against dead reaction held ideological similarity and favourable outlook the non aligned movement politics jawaharlal nehru gamal abdel nasser and josip broz tito and historically opposed affiliation with either the american led western bloc the soviet led eastern bloc during the cold war concepts arab nation michel aflaq aflaq supported sati husri that language was the principal defining unifying factor the arab nation because language led the unity norms and history was also another unifying was the fertile ground which our consciousness took the centre athist thought was the feature ath literally meaning renaissance this renaissance could only reached uniting the arab and would transform the arab world economically intellectually and this future would rebirth the first arab according was the origins islam the seventh the new renaissance would bring another arab this view was summed the ath slogan one bearing eternal the arab nation could only reach this renaissance through revolutionary process towards the goals liberty and nation could only progress decline arab states his time could only progressively decline because their illnesses feudalism sectarianism regionalism intellectual reactionism these aflaq could only resolved through revolutionary revolution could only succeed the revolutionaries were and devoted nearly religiously the aflaq supported the leninist view the need vanguard party following successful successful revolution was not inevitable the athist was the ath aflaq believed that the youth were the key for successful the youth were open change and enlightenment because they still been indoctrinated with other major according was the disillusionment the arab disillusionment led individualism and individualism was not healthy sign underdeveloped country contrast developed countries where was healthy the main before the was spread enlightened ideas the people and challenge reactionary and conservative elements according ath party would ensue policy keep the uneducated masses out the party until the party leadership was enlightened with the thoughts however the party was also political and notes politics was means the most serious matters this present athism was similar communist thought that vanguard party would rule for unspecified length construct new society aflaq supported the idea committed activist revolutionary party based the leninist model which practice was based democratic centralism the revolutionary party would seize political power and from there transform society for the greater while the revolutionary party was numerically was all powerful which had the right initiate policy even the majority the population were against with the leninist the ath party knew what was right and what was the population whole did not know this they were still influenced the old value and moral reactionary classes according the arab revolt against the ottoman empire failed unify the arab world because was led reactionary class believed the ruling who supported the monarchy the leaders the arab revolt were synonymous with reactionary athist the ruling class replaced revolutionary progressive aflaq was bitterly opposed any kind monarchy and described the arab revolt the illusions kings and feudal lords who understood unity the gathering backwardness exploitation exploitation and numbers numbers like was the reactionary view arab unity which had left the arab revolt struggle for unity without blood and aflaq saw the german unification proof this view was stark contrast other arab nationalist most arab nationalists were germanophiles according bismarck unification germany established the most repressive nation the world had ever development which could largely blamed according the existing monarchy and the reactionary copy the german example would according and would lead the enslavement the arab the only way combat the reactionary classes laid progressive revolution central which struggle for this struggle could not separated from the social separate these two would the same weaken the the reactionary who are content with the status quo would oppose the progressive revolution even the revolution succeeded one region that region would unable develop because the resource small populations and the revolution forces held other arab for revolution succeed the arab world would have evolve into organic literally become arab unity both the cause the progressive revolution and its major obstacle the success the revolution the arab league aflaq believed that the arab league strengthened both regional interests and the reactionary thus weakening the chance establishing arab because the world where the majority arab states were under the rule the reactionary revised his ideology meet instead creating arab nation through arab wide progressive the main task were progressive revolutionaries had succeeded was spread the these progressive revolutionary countries would then one one unite until the arab world had evolved into arab the revolution would not succeed the progressive revolutionary governments did not contribute spreading the liberty aflaq speech dated aflaq saw liberty one the defining features articulation thoughts and the interaction between individuals were way building new was according which created new values and aflaq believed that living under imperialism colonialism religious enlightened dictatorship weakened ideas came from not from below through human one the ath main priorities according was disseminate new ideas and give individuals the liberty they needed pursue the party would interpose itself between the arab people and both their foreign imperialist oppressors and those forms tyranny that arise within arab while the notion liberty was important ideal favored the leninist model continuous revolutionary and did not develop concepts for society which liberty was protected set institutions and his vision one party state ruled the ath which disseminated information the was many ways contrary his view individual the ath party through its preeminence would establish liberty according liberty could not just come from needed enlightened progressive group create truly free fundamentally aflaq had authoritarian perspective contrast the liberal democratic concept vision liberty would ensured ath party which was not elected the because the party had the common good historian paul salem has said that the weakness such system quite socialism arab socialism aflaq view the necessity socialism aflaq deeply supported some marxist tenets and considered the marxist concept the importance material economic conditions one modern greatest however disagreed with the marxist view that dialectical materialism was the only truth aflaq believed that marxism had forgotten while believing that the concept would work for small and weak the concept dialectical materialism the only truth arab development was for people spiritual the the working class was just albeit the most important much larger movement free the arab unlike karl marx aflaq was uncertain what place the working class had aflaq contrast believed nationalism and believed that the arab world all and not just the working were working against capitalist domination the foreign what was struggle between various classes the west was the arab world fight for political and economic for socialism was necessary means accomplishing the goal initiating arabic renaissance period other period modernisation while unity brought the arab world together and liberty provided the arab people with socialism was the cornerstone which made unity and liberty socialism meant constitutional democratic system would not succeed country such syria that was dominated economic system which the repression the peasant nullified the political liberty meant little nothing the general stricken populace aflaq saw socialism the solution their according the ultimate goal not answer the question how much state control was necessary economic but instead socialism was means satisfy the animal needs man can free pursue his duties human other socialism was system which freed the population from enslavement and created independent however economic equality was major tenet athist the elimination inequality would eliminate all exploitation and domination one group over liberty was the arab people needed aflaq labelled this form socialism arab socialism signify that existed harmony and was some ways subordinate arab nationalism according who was the teaching and reforms the prophet muhammed had given socialism authentic arab socialism was viewed aflaq justice and the reforms the prophet muhammed were both just and the athist modern initiate another way just and radical forms just the prophet had done the seventh role islam from one works dating back about character though christian aflaq viewed the creation islam proof arab and testament arab values and the essence according was its revolutionary aflaq called all both muslims and muslims admire the role islam had played creating arab but his view islam was purely and aflaq emphasised that should not state and time and again aflaq emphasised that the ath party was against atheism but also against fundamentalism the fundamentalists represented false according athist all religions were despite his atheist aflaq was strong supporter secular government and stated athist state would replace religion with state based arab and freedom during the shia riots against the iraqi ath government the aflaq warned saddam hussein making any concessions the exclaiming that the ath party with faith but not religious nor should during his vice the time the shia saddam discussed the need convince large segments the population convert the party line stance saddam stance secularisation changed following the iran iraq war when law was passed allowing men kill their daughters and wives they were when aflaq died official announcement the iraqi regional command stated that aflaq had converted islam before his but unnamed western diplomat iraq told william harris that family was not aware that had undergone any religious prior during and after the gulf war the government became progressively more islamic the beginning the saddam proclaimed the ath party the party arabism and neo athism abraham tzur labelled the ath party which took power the march revolution syria and had taken power iraq the for the reason that the ath party had dumped their pan arab credentials the key party document some theoretical propositions states that socialism the true goal arab arab unity the obligatory basis for constructing socialist pan arabism became the means reach the economic and social john devlin agrees the and states that the ath which started with unity its overwhelming top which was prepared work within variety middle eastern political which wanted social justice had pretty much disappeared the early its place rose ath organisations which focused primarily their own which and created where authoritarian centralised which rested heavily military power and which were very close other socialist movements and were less distinctively munif razzaz the former secretary general the national command the unitary ath party agreed with the and stated that from onwards there existed two ath parties the military ath party and the ath and real power lay with the further stated that the military ath paraphrased martin was and remains athist only that was and remains little more than military clique with civilian and that from the initial founding the military committee disgruntled syrian officers exiled cairo the chain events and the total corruption athism proceeded with intolerable salah din bitar agreed stating that the syrian coup tat marked the end athist politics aflaq shared the stating longer recognise salah jadid government abandoned the traditional goal arab unity and replaced with radical form western this emerged the terminology the terms such itself maoist term the six day war was proclaimed against and class struggle were used the syrian communist party played important role some communists held ministerial and jadid established fairly close with the communist party the soviet union the government supported more radical economic state ownership over industry and foreign trade while the same time trying restructure agrarian relations and bitar left the ath claiming that these parties had ceased what they set retaining only their names and acting the organs power and the instruments regional and dictatorial contrary aflaq remained with the ath and became the ideologue the dominated ath his ideological views remained more less the but was sidelined assadism from when hafez assad took syria has been under the control the assad family assad government was personal meaning government that based upon and revolves around the the term assadism was coined explain how leadership cult dominates syrian the authorities have tried portray the wisdom assad beyond the comprehension the average assadism and athist government which currently runs syria are based upon nepotism and ethnic favoritism was assad who began the alawitisation the party and the and began building government based loyalty the jamal attasi former founder zaki arsuzi arab ath party and later syrian claimed that assadism false the domination and not talking just the alawites who control the nervous include also the army and the mukhabarat and despite its socialist the state run class who has made fortune without nouvelle bourgeoisie parasitaire despite assadism not ideology cult personality but the closest thing syria comes
