that had settled the city amsterdam the wake the alhambra decree spain and the portuguese inquisition which had resulted forced conversions and expulsions from the iberian peninsula attracted the decree toleration issued the union utrecht portuguese conversos first sailed amsterdam and promptly reconverted permission was granted build and ordinance for the admission and government the jews was community the portuguese jews amsterdam were highly proud their the spinoza family espinosa probably had its origins espinosa los monteros near burgos espinosa cerrato near palencia both northern castile spain the family was expelled from spain and fled portugal compelled them convert catholicism spinoza father was born roughly century after this forced conversion the small portuguese city vidigueira near beja alentejo when father was still spinoza isaac spinoza who was from lisbon took his family nantes they were expelled and moved rotterdam where isaac died spinoza miguel and his manuel then moved amsterdam where they resumed the practice miguel was successful merchant and became warden the synagogue and the amsterdam jewish buried three wives and three his six children died before reaching century holland amsterdam and rotterdam operated important cosmopolitan centers where merchant ships from many parts the world brought people various customs and this flourishing commercial activity made for culture relatively tolerant the play new sheltered from the censorious hand ecclesiastical not chance the philosophical works both descartes and spinoza were developed the cultural and intellectual background the dutch republic the spinoza may have had access circle friends who were unconventional terms social including members the collegiants one the people knew was niels stensen brilliant danish student others included albert burgh with whom spinoza known have early life moses and aaron church baruch espinoza was born november the jodenbuurt netherlands was the second son miguel although not portuguese sephardic jewish merchant his ana miguel second died when baruch was only six years spinoza mother tongue was although also knew spanish dutch perhaps and later although wrote spinoza learned latin late his spinoza had traditional jewish attending the keter torah yeshiva the amsterdam talmud torah congregation headed the learned and traditional senior rabbi saul levi morteira his teachers also included the less traditional rabbi manasseh ben israel man wide learning and secular friend vossius grotius and rembrandt while presumably star and perhaps considered potential spinoza never reached the advanced study the torah the upper levels the instead the age after the death his elder isaac cut short his formal studies order begin working the family importing age spinoza began studying latin with frances van den enden franciscus van den enden notorious free former and radical democrat who likely introduced spinoza scholastic and modern philosophy including that decade the early van den enden was considered cartesian and atheist and his books were put the catholic index banned books spinoza miguel died when spinoza was duly recited kaddish the jewish prayer for eleven months required jewish when his sister rebekah disputed his took her court establish his won his but then renounced his claim her spinoza adopted the latin name benedictus began boarding with van den and began teaching his following anecdote early biography johannes said have fallen love with his clara but she rejected him for richer this story has been discounted the basis that clara maria van den enden was born and would have been more than about years old when spinoza left she married dirck kerckring during this period spinoza also became acquainted with the collegiants clerical sect remonstrants with tendencies towards rationalism and with the mennonites who had existed for century but were close the many his friends belonged dissident christian groups which met regularly discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority established churches well traditional should though spinoza break with the prevailing dogmas and particularly the insistence mosaic authorship the was not rather appears have been the result lengthy internal anyone thinks criticism regarding the authorship the too sweeping nature and lacking sufficient would ask him undertake show these narratives definite plan such might legitimately imitated historians their shall once admit and will mighty for confess that all efforts over long period have resulted such indeed may add that write nothing here that not the fruit lengthy and although have been educated from boyhood the accepted beliefs concerning have felt bound the end embrace the views here nevertheless once branded spinoza clashes with authorities became more for questioned two members his spinoza apparently responded that god has body and nothing scripture says was later attacked the steps the synagogue wielding assailant shouting was apparently quite shaken this attack and for years kept and his torn unmended after his death spinoza and his younger brother gabriel ran the family importing the business ran into serious financial however perhaps result the first dutch war march spinoza filed suit with the amsterdam municipal authorities declared orphan order escape his business debts and that could inherit his estate which first was incorporated into his without being subject his after having made substantial contributions the talmud torah synagogue and reduced his december contribution and his march pledge nominal amounts and the march pledge was never spinoza was eventually able relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts his younger gabriel and devote himself chiefly the study especially the system expounded descartes and expulsion from the jewish community july the talmud torah congregation amsterdam issued writ cherem kind shunning ostracism expulsion excommunication against the year old the following document translates the official record the the lords the having long known the evil opinions and acts baruch have endeavored various means and turn him from his evil but having failed make him mend his wicked and the daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which practiced and taught and about his monstrous and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness this effect the presence the said they became convinced the truth the and after all this has been investigated the presence the honorable they have with their that the said espinoza should excommunicated and expelled from the people the decree the and the command the holy expel curse and damn baruch with the consent blessed and with the consent all the holy front these holy scrolls with the six thirteen precepts which are written with the excommunication with which joshua banned with the curse with which elisha cursed the and with all the curses which are written the book the cursed day and cursed cursed when lies and cursed when rises cursed when goes and cursed when comes the lord will not spare the anger and wrath the lord will rage against this and bring upon him all the curses which are written this and the lord will blot out his name from under and the lord will separate him his injury from all the tribes israel with all the curses the which are written the book the but you who cleave unto the lord god are all alive this order that one should communicate with him orally show him any stay with him under the same within four ells read anything composed written the talmud torah congregation issued censure matters great and such edict was not the hague the language censure unusually however and does not appear any other censure known have been issued the portuguese jewish community the exact reason for expelling spinoza not the censure refers only the abominable heresies that practiced and his monstrous and the testimony witnesses the presence the said there record such but there appear have been several likely reasons for the issuance the first there were radical theological views that was apparently expressing philosopher and spinoza biographer steven nadler puts doubt was giving utterance just those ideas that would soon appear his philosophical those spinoza denies the immortality the strongly rejects the notion providential the god isaac and and claims that the law was neither literally given god nor any longer binding can there any mystery why one boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned orthodox jewish second there ample basis assume that the amsterdam jewish largely comprising former conversos having within the last century fled from the portuguese inquisition and their children and must have been concerned protect its reputation from any association with spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution there little evidence that the amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved censure but the town council expressly ordered the portuguese jewish regulate their conduct and ensure that the members the community kept strict observance jewish and other such bans adopted the synagogue itself public wedding funeral processions and discussing religious matters with lest such activity might disturb the liberty makes clear that the danger upsetting the civil authorities was never far from thus the issuance censure was almost exercise censorship the portuguese jewish community third appears likely that spinoza himself had already taken the initiative separate himself from the talmud torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility judaism had probably stopped attending services the synagogue either after the lawsuit with his sister after the knife attack its might already have been voicing the view expressed his theological political treatise that the civil authorities should suppress judaism harmful the jews either for financial other had any case effectively stopped contributing the synagogue march had also committed the monstrous contrary the regulations the synagogue and the views certain rabbinical authorities including filing suit civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities renounce his upon being notified the issuance the reported have very this does not force anything that would not have done own had not been afraid thus unlike most the censure issued routinely the amsterdam congregation discipline its the censure issued against spinoza did not lead repentance and was never after the spinoza said have addressed apology written the elders the which defended his views and condemned the rabbis for accusing him horrible practices and other merely because had neglected ceremonial this apology does not but some its contents may later have been included his theological political treatise for cited series cryptic statements medieval biblical commentator abraham ibn ezra intimating that certain apparently anachronistic passages the pentateuch canaanite was then the genesis which ibn ezra called mystery and exhorted those who keep were not mosaic authorship proof that his own views had valid historical the most remarkable aspect the censure may not much its even refusal but the fact that expulsion from the jewish community did not lead his conversion spinoza kept the latin and implicitly name benedict maintained close association with the christian even moved town near the headquarters and was buried christian but there evidence suggestion that ever accepted baptism participated christian thus baruch espinoza became the first secular jew modern the philosopher richard popkin questions the historical veracity the which popkin claims emerged close years after why later life and career rijnsburg spinoza spent his remaining years writing and studying private spinoza believed philosophy tolerance and and actually lived the life was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged however even those who were against him had admit lived saintly besides the religious nobody really had much bad say about spinoza other sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase after the the amsterdam municipal responding the appeals the and also the calvinist who had been vicariously offended the existence free thinker the promptly expelled spinoza from spent brief time near the village ouderkerk aan amstel but returned soon afterwards amsterdam and lived there quietly for several giving private philosophy lessons and grinding before leaving the city during this time spinoza wrote his short treatise man and his being which two dutch translations discovered about spinoza moved around from amsterdam rijnsburg near leiden the headquarters the rijnsburg began work his descartes principles well his the ethics returned briefly where finished and published descartes principles the only work published his lifetime under his own and then moved the same year voorburg author named margaret whur wrote book baruch talking little about his attitude towards women and how treated she also his addiction which was acceptable back then for men whose philosophical vision was influential and although personal life was and hard therefore received less attention from voorburg spinoza continued work the ethics and corresponded with philosophers and theologians across also wrote and published his theological political treatise defense secular and constitutional and support jan witt the grand pensionary the against the the prince leibniz who visited claimed that life was danger when supporters the prince orange murdered witt while published the work did not long remain and enemies characterized forged hell renegade jew and the and issued with the knowledge jan was condemned the synod the reformed church and formally banned lens grinding and optics spinoza earned modest living from grinding and instrument yet while living voorburg through correspondence and friendships with scientist christiaan huygens and mathematician johannes hudde was involved important optical investigations the day including debate over microscope design with favoring small objectives and collaborating calculations for prospective telescope which would have been one the largest europe the the quality lenses was much praised christiaan huygens among others fact his technique and instruments were esteemed constantijn huygens ground clear and telescope lens from one grinding dishes years after his the exact type lenses spinoza made are not but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and was said anatomist theodor kerckring have produced excellent microscope the quality which was the foundation anatomy during his time lens and instrument maker was also supported but donations from close the hague spinoza moved the hague where lived small pension from jan witt and small annuity from the brother his dead simon worked the ethics wrote unfinished hebrew began his political treatise wrote two scientific essays the and the calculation and began dutch translation that later the spinoza chose the latin word caute inscribed beneath itself symbol his having chosen write language that was widely was compelled hide what had spinoza was offered the chair philosophy the university heidelberg but refused because the possibility that might some way curb his complete freedom thought spinoza met with leibniz the hague for discussion his principal philosophical ethics which had been completed this meeting was described matthew the courtier and the heretic spinoza health began fail and died february the age his premature death was said due lung possibly silicosis result breathing glass dust from the lenses later shrine was made his home the textbooks and encyclopedias often depict spinoza solitary soul who eked out living lens had many friends but kept his needs preached philosophy tolerance and anthony gottlieb described him living saintly the reviewer stuart phelps noted one has ever come nearer the ideal life the philosopher than another harold bloom wrote teacher practiced his own and was surely one the most exemplary human beings ever have according the new york times outward appearance was but not his way living was exceedingly modest and often did not leave his room for many days was likewise almost incredibly his expenses sometimes amounted only few pence according harold bloom and the chicago tribune appears have had sexual spinoza also corresponded with peter serrarius radical protestant and millennarian merchant serrarius was patron spinoza after spinoza left the jewish and even had letters sent and received for the philosopher and from third spinoza and serrarius maintained their relationship until death the beginning the spinoza name became more widely and eventually gottfried leibniz and henry oldenburg paid him stated matthew the courtier and the heretic spinoza corresponded with oldenburg for the rest his short writings and correspondence the writings ren descartes have been described starting spinoza first publication was his geometric exposition proofs using the geometric method the model euclid with axioms etc parts and principles philosophy spinoza has been associated with leibniz and descartes rationalists contrast empiricists from december june spinoza engaged correspondence with willem van blijenbergh amateur calvinist theologian who questioned spinoza the definition evil later spinoza notified oldenburg that had started work new the theologico political treatise published leibniz disagreed harshly with spinoza own later published manuscript refutation but also known have met with spinoza least one occasion mentioned and his own work bears some striking resemblances specific important parts philosophy monadology when the public reactions the anonymously published theologico political treatise were extremely unfavourable his brand spinoza was compelled abstain from publishing more his wary and wore signet ring which used mark his letters and which was engraved with rose and the word caute latin for cautiously the ethics and all other apart from the descartes principles philosophy and the theologico political treatise were published after his the opera posthuma edited his friends secrecy avoid confiscation and destruction the ethics contains many unresolved obscurities and written with forbidding mathematical structure modeled geometry and has been described superbly cryptic philosophy magnum opus ethics attributes and modes philosophy spinoza these are the fundamental concepts with which spinoza sets forth vision illuminated his awareness they may seem strange first the question what its and karl jaspers spinoza argued that god exists and abstract and spinoza system imparted order and unity the tradition radical thought offering powerful weapons for prevailing against received youth first subscribed descartes dualistic belief that body and mind are two separate but later changed his view and asserted that they were not being single contended that everything that exists nature everything the one reality and there only one set rules governing the whole the reality which surrounds and which are spinoza viewed god and nature two names for the same namely fundamental substance meaning that which stands rather than matter that the basis the universe and which all lesser entities are actually modes that all things are determined nature exist and cause and that the complex chain cause and effect understood only his identification god with nature was more fully explained his posthumously published ethics spinoza main contention with cartesian body dualism was mind and body were truly then not clear how they can coordinate any that humans presume themselves have free will result their awareness appetites which affect their minds while being unable understand the reasons why they want and act they spinoza has been described one writer epicurean although call spinoza materialist the epicureans would misleading treats both thought the realm the mind and and extension physical derivatives infinite substance deus sive which expresses infinite attributes and use human experience but single drop water infinite ocean which constitutes spinoza contends that deus sive natura god being infinitely many which thought and extension are his account the nature then seems treat the physical and mental worlds causally and deriving from the same important note here parts through the ethics spinoza describes how the human mind affected both mental and physical directly contests the universal substance emanates both body and while they are different there fundamental difference between these this formulation historically significant solution the mind body problem known neutral monism spinoza system also envisages god that does not rule over the universe providence which god can make but god which itself the deterministic system which everything nature while could said that this still accounts for divine spinoza argues that things could not have been produced god any other way any other order than the directly challenges transcendental god which actively responds events the everything that has and will happen part long chain cause and effect metaphysical humans are unable amount prayer ritual will sway only knowledge the existence which humans allows them best respond the world around thus according this understanding the universe humans currently live and experience comes from god completely impersonal existence not only impossible for two infinite substances exist two infinities being god being the ultimate cannot affected anything else would affected something and not the fundamental addition the other two fundamental concepts spinoza presents and develops the ethics are attribute that which the intellect perceives constituting the essence and mode manner citation needed spinoza was thoroughgoing determinist who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation necessity for even human behaviour fully with freedom being our capacity know are determined and understand why act freedom not the possibility say what happens but the possibility say yes and fully understand why things should necessarily happen that forming more adequate ideas about what and our emotions affections become the adequate cause our effects internal which entails increase activity versus this means that become both more free and more like spinoza argues the scholium part however spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that therefore humans have free they however that their will this illusionary perception freedom stems from our human experience and indifference prior natural humans think they are free but they dream with their eyes for our actions are guided entirely natural his letter schuller letter men are conscious their desire and unaware the causes which their are this picture determinism ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote ethics the infant believes that free will that seeks the the angry boy believes that free will wishes the timid man thinks with free will seeks the drunkard believes that free command his mind speaks the things which when sober wishes had left all believe that they speak free command the whilst they have power restrain the impulse which they have thus for spinoza morality and ethical judgment like choice predicated for and are non existent human ideals only fathomable the mind because are acclimatized human consciousness interlinking with our experience that have false ideal choice predicated upon spinoza philosophy has much common with stoicism inasmuch both philosophies sought fulfill therapeutic role instructing people how attain however spinoza differed sharply from the stoics one important utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat the emotion can only displaced overcome stronger for the crucial distinction was between active and passive the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are also held that knowledge true causes passive emotion can transform active thus anticipating one the key ideas sigmund freud psychoanalysis ethical philosophy encapsulated the start his treatise the improvement the understanding tractatus intellectus emendatione the core ethical what held the true and final spinoza held good and evil relative concepts claiming that nothing intrinsically good bad except relative things that had classically been seen good spinoza were simply good bad for spinoza believes deterministic universe which all things nature proceed from certain necessity and with the utmost nothing happens chance and nothing contingent spinoza ethics ethics the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature according reality circumstances are seen unfortunate only because our inadequate conception while components the chain cause and effect are not beyond the understanding human human grasp the infinitely complex whole limited because the limits science empirically take account the whole spinoza also asserted that sense though practical and useful for inadequate for discovering universal spinoza mathematical and logical approach metaphysics and therefore concluded that emotion formed from inadequate his concept conatus states that human natural inclination strive toward preserving essential being and assertion that human power defined success this preservation being the guidance reason central ethical according the highest virtue the intellectual love knowledge the final part the ethics his concern with the meaning true and his explanation how emotions must detached from external cause and master foreshadow psychological techniques developed the his concept three types reason intuition and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction lead his proposition that the more are conscious ourselves and the more perfect and blessed are and that only intuitive knowledge his unique contribution understanding the workings mind even during this time radical philosophical that his views provide bridge between mystical past and psychology the present given insistence completely ordered world where necessity reigns good and evil have absolute the world exists looks imperfect only because our limited history reception pantheist panentheist spinozism pantheism controversy widespread belief that spinoza equated god with the material has therefore been called the prophet and prince and most eminent expounder pantheism more letter henry oldenburg the view certain people that identify god with nature taken kind mass corporeal they are quite for our universe mode under two attributes thought and extension god has infinitely many other attributes which are not present our according german philosopher karl jaspers when spinoza wrote deus sive natura god spinoza meant god was natura naturans not natura naturata and jaspers believed that his philosophical did not mean say that god and nature are interchangeable but rather that transcendence was attested his infinitely many and that two attributes known namely thought and signified immanence even god under the attributes thought and extension cannot identified strictly with our that world course divisible has but spinoza insists that attribute substance can truly conceived from which follows that the substance can which means that one cannot conceive attribute way that leads division and that substance which absolutely infinite part propositions and following this our world should considered mode under two attributes thought and therefore according the pantheist formula one and would apply spinoza only the one preserves its transcendence and the all were not interpreted the totality finite martial roult suggested the term panentheism rather than pantheism describe view the relation between god and the the world not but strong god not only finite things have god their they cannot conceived without other the world subset however american panentheist philosopher charles hartshorne insisted the term classical pantheism describe friedrich heinrich jacobi published condemnation pantheism after lessing was thought have confessed his deathbed being spinozist which was the equivalent his time being called jacobi claimed that doctrine was pure because all nature and god are said nothing but extended substance this for was the result enlightenment rationalism and would finally end absolute atheism moses mendelssohn disagreed with saying that there actual difference between theism and the issue became major intellectual and religious concern for european civilization the the attraction philosophy late century europeans was that provided alternative atheism and three ideas strongly appealed the unity all that the regularity all that the identity spirit and spinoza pantheism was praised but was considered some alarming and dangerously spinoza god deus sive natura provided natural contrast the newtonian mechanical first cause the dead mechanism the french man coleridge and shelley saw philosophy religion nature novalis called him the intoxicated spinoza inspired the poet shelley write his essay the necessity atheism spinoza was considered atheist because used the word god signify concept that was different from that traditional christian spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness has neither feeling nor does not act according but everything follows necessarily from his according thus spinoza indifferent god the antithesis the concept fatherly god who cares about according the stanford encyclopedia philosophy spinoza god infinite ethics all and capable loving both and insofar are part his and the mark personal being that one towards which can entertain personal then should note too that spinoza recommends amor intellectualist dei the intellectual love the supreme good for however the matter spinoza god does not have free will does not have purposes intentions and spinoza insists that neither intellect nor will pertain the nature moreover while may love need remember that god really not the kind being who could ever love who loves god cannot strive that god should love him says spinoza steven nadler suggests that settling the question atheism pantheism depends analysis pantheism associated with then spinoza not since spinoza believes that the proper stance take towards god not one reverence religious but instead one objective study and since taking the religious stance would leave one open the possibility error and comparison eastern philosophies similarities between philosophy and eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed many the century german sanskritist theodore cker was one the early figures notice the similarities between religious conceptions and the vedanta tradition writing that thought was western system philosophy which occupies foremost rank amongst the philosophies all nations and and which exact representation the ideas the that might have suspected its founder have borrowed the fundamental principles his system from the did his biography not satisfy that was wholly unacquainted with their mean the philosophy man whose very life picture that moral purity and intellectual indifference the transitory charms this which the constant longing the true vedanta comparing the fundamental ideas both should have difficulty proving had spinoza been his system would all probability mark last phase the vedanta max muller his noted the striking similarities between vedanta and the system saying the conceived the upanishads and defined clearly the same helena blavatsky founder the theosophical society also compared religious thought writing unfinished essay natura conceived his attributes simply and and the same natura naturata conceived the endless series modifications the direct outflowing results from the properties these the vedantic deity pure and spinoza reception the
