philosophy	causality navigation search cause causality casualty has been suggested that causal inference merged into this discuss proposed since february the illustrated sutra cause and effect causality also referred causation the relation between event the cause and second event the effect where the second event understood physical consequence the common causality also the relation between set factors and phenomenon the effect anything that affects effect factor that direct factor factor that affects effect that without any intervening intervening factors are sometimes called intermediate the connection between and effect this way can also referred causal nexus causes and effects are typically related events such causes are moving the word also used mean answer why including final and formal then the the explanans while the the this there are various recognizable kinds candidates include objects processes properties variables facts and states affairs failure recognize that different kinds are being considered can lead the philosophical treatment the subject causality extends over the western philosophical discussion stretches back least aristotle and the topic remains staple contemporary philosophy contents history western philosophy aristotelian middle ages after the middle ages the second law thermodynamics causality determinism and existentialism

potentiality and actuality aristotle identified four kinds answer explanatory mode various questions result traditional peculiarities with translations between ancient latin and the word nowadays customarily used label four material cause the material from whence thing has come that which persists while for one mother the bronze statue see also substance theory formal cause whereby dynamic form static shape determines the properties and human differs from statue human statue differs from lump efficient cause which imparts the first relevant movement human lifts rock raises final cause the criterion the end may refer action inanimate examples socrates takes walk after dinner for the sake his earth falls the lowest level because that its four kinds explanatory only the efficient cause defined the leading paragraph this present the other three explanatory modes would now called material structure and and again criterion the word that aristotle used was for the present that greek word would better translated explanation than cause those words are most often used current another translation aristotle that meant the four four kinds answer why questions some works the four causes are listed the essential the logical the moving and the final this statement essential cause demonstration that indicated object conforms definition the word that refers statement logical ground argument why object statement these are further examples the idea that cause general the context usage explanation the word efficient used here can also translated from aristotle moving initiating efficient causation was connected with aristotelian physics which recognized the four elements air fire water and added the fifth element water and earth their intrinsic property gravitas heaviness intrinsically fall whereas air and fire their intrinsic property levitas lightness intrinsically rise away earth the motionless center the straight line while accelerating during the approach its natural air remained however and did not escape earth while eventually achieving infinite aristotle inferred that the universe finite size and contains invisible substance that held planet earth and its the sublunary sphere centered the and since celestial bodies exhibit unaccelerated motion orbiting planet earth unchanging aristotle inferred that the fifth aither that fills space and composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves perpetual the only constant motion between two object traveling straight line from point and back must stop either point before returning the left thing exhibits natural motion but according aristotelian metaphysics exhibit enforced motion imparted efficient the form plants endows plants with the processes nutrition and the form animals adds and the form humankind adds reason atop rock normally exhibits natural motion explained the material cause being composed the element but living thing can lift the enforced motion diverting the rock from its natural place and natural further kind aristotle identified the final specifying purpose criterion completion light which something should aristotle himself cause means one that the result whose presence something comes into the bronze statue and the silver and the classes which contain these the material cause another the form that the essential formula and the classes which contain the ratio and number general the cause the and the parts the formula the formal cause the source the first beginning change the man who plans and the father the cause the and general that which produces the cause that which and that which changes that which changed the efficient cause the same end the final the end walking for why does man and saying this consider that have supplied the cause the final cause all those means towards the end which arise the instigation something fat purging drugs and instruments are causes for they all have the end their although they differ from each other being some others actions necessary metaphysics book section translated hugh tredennick aristotle further discerned two modes proper causation and accidental causation all proper and can spoken potential particular the same language refers the effects that generic effects are assigned generic particular effects particular and actual effects operating averting infinite regress aristotle inferred the first unmoved mover the first too must have been but being unmoved must have moved only toward particular goal the universe material formal and efficient causes reflected the final citation needed middle ages line with aristotelian thomas aquinas posed hierarchy prioritizing four final efficient material formal aquinas sought identify the first efficient now simply first cause everyone would said call god later the middle many scholars conceded that the first cause was but explained that many earthly events occur within design and thereby scholars sought freedom investigate the numerous secondary causes after the middle ages with the end the middle ages however aristotle especially concerning formal and final was criticized authors such niccol machiavelli the field political and francis bacon concerning science more widely used modern definition causality was originally given david hume denied that can ever perceive cause and except developing habit custom mind where come associate two types object always contiguous and occurring one after the part section hume expanded this list eight ways judging whether two things might cause and the first and then additionally there are three connected criteria which come from our experience and which are the source most our philosophical and then two physicist max born distinguished determination from for determination meant that actual events are linked laws nature that certainly reliable predictions and retrodictions can made from sufficient present data about for there are two kinds which may here call nomic generic and singular nomic causality means that cause and effect are linked more less certain probabilistic general laws covering many possible potential may recognize this probabilized version criterion hume mentioned just singular causation means that unique particular chains actual events are essentially and physically linked antecedence and which may here recognize criteria and hume mentioned just the second law thermodynamics thermodynamics branch physics the second law thermodynamics discovered the helps define arrow time this provides opportunity physically describe how causes differ from the sum effects can never have lower entropy than the sum causes provided equilibrium this more thoroughly described causality determinism and existentialism the deterministic world view one which the universe more than chain events following one after another according the law cause and hold this worldview incompatibilist there such thing free will however compatibilists argue that determinism compatible even necessary free existentialists argue that while intrinsic meaning has been designed deterministic each can provide meaning for indian philosophy karma karma the belief held sanathana dharma and major religions that actions cause certain effects the current life future life positively the various philosophical schools darsanas provide different accounts the the doctrine satkaryavada affirms that the effect inheres the cause some the effect thus either real apparent modification the the doctrine asatkaryavada affirms that the effect does not inhere the but new see nyaya for some details the theory causation the nyaya brahma samhita brahma describes krishna the prime cause all the types causes identified aristotle see are also recognized the vedic the material cause the instrumental cause the formal cause and the ultimate cause citation needed identifies five causes for any action knowing which can the the individual the the efforts and the buddhist philosophy prat according the theory action and result our karmic actions are the principal cause our happiness from the buddhist point positive wholesome action one that will lead greater happiness for ourselves and and negative unwholesome action one that will lead greater suffering for ourselves the general universal definition pratityasamutpada dependent dependent interdependent that everything arises dependence upon multiple causes and nothing exists independent traditional example used buddhist texts three sticks standing upright and leaning against each other and supporting each one stick taken the other two will fall the thich nhat hanh pratitya samutpada sometimes called the teaching cause and but that can because usually think cause and effect separate with cause always preceding and one cause leading one according the teaching interdependent cause and effect arise and everything result multiple causes and the this image three cut reeds can stand only leaning one you take one the other two will for table need time skillfulness and many other and each these causes needs other causes the wood needs the the the and the carpenter needs his breakfast fresh and and each those has brought about other causes and continue look this see that nothing has been left everything the cosmos has come together bring this looking deeply the the leaves the and the can see the the one can seen the and the all can seen the one cause never enough bring about cause the same and every effect must also the cause something cause and effect the idea first and only something that does not itself need cannot logic necessary and sufficient causes similar concept occurs for this see necessary and sufficient conditions causes are often distinguished into two necessary and third type which requires neither necessity nor sufficiency and but which contributes the called contributory necessary necessary cause then the presence necessarily implies the presence the presence however does not imply that will sufficient sufficient cause then the presence necessarily implies the presence however another cause may alternatively cause thus the presence does not imply the presence contributory cause may classified contributory the presumed cause precedes the and altering the cause alters the does not require that all those subjects which possess the contributory cause experience the does not require that all those subjects which are free the contributory cause free the other contributory cause may neither necessary nor sufficient but must mackie argues that usual talk cause fact refers inus conditions insufficient but redundant parts condition which itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence the for short circuit cause for house burning consider the collection the short the proximity flammable and the absence together these are unnecessary but sufficient the burning down since many other collections events certainly could have led the house burning for example shooting the house with flamethrower the presence oxygen etc within this the short circuit insufficient since the short circuit itself would not have caused the but the fire would not have happened without everything else being but redundant part condition which itself unnecessary since something else could have also caused the house burn but sufficient for the occurrence the the short circuit inus condition for the occurrence the house burning causality contrasted with conditionals conditional statements are not statements important distinction that statements causality require the antecedent precede coincide with the consequent whereas conditional statements not require this temporal confusion commonly arises since many different statements english may presented using then form arguably because this form far more commonly used make statement the two types statements are however for all the following statements are true when interpreting then the material barack obama president the united states then germany george washington president the united states then arbitrary the first true since both the antecedent and the consequent are the second true sentential logic and indeterminate natural regardless the consequent statement that because the antecedent the ordinary indicative conditional has somewhat more structure than the material for although the first the neither the preceding two statements seems true ordinary indicative but the sentence shakespeare avon did not write then someone else intuitively seems even though there straightforward causal relation this hypothetical situation between not writing macbeth and someone actually writing another sort the counterfactual conditional has stronger connection with yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples consider the following two were then would have three switch were then bulb would the first would not correct say that being triangle caused have three since the relationship between triangularity and sidedness that the property having three sides actually determines state nonetheless even when interpreted the first statement full grasp the concept conditionals important understanding the literature crucial stumbling block that conditionals everyday english are usually loosely used describe general for drop then shoe gets relates infinite number possible shorthand for for any fact that would count dropping some fact that counts shoe gets will this general statement will strictly false there any circumstance where drop coffee and shoe get however then statement logic typically relates two specific events specific dropping did did not and specific wetting did did not thus with explicit events drop coffee and wet then true that dropped then wet regardless the fact that yesterday dropped coffee the trash for the opposite the conditional relates specific facts more drop coffee then also true that drop coffee then wet dropping coffee implies wet regardless whether wet shoe not any this usage would not counterintuitive were not for the everyday briefly then equivalent the order logic statement implies not where and are but the more familiar usage then statement would need written symbolically using higher order logic using quantifiers for and there questionable cause questionable cause fallacies questionable also known causal non causa pro causa latin for cause for false are informal fallacies where cause incorrectly theories causal model counterfactual theories counterfactual conditional counterfactual conditional sometimes called subjunctive conditional remote conditional and abbreviated modal subjunctive conditional statement indicating what would the case its antecedent were this contrasted with material which indicates what the case its antecedent true psychological research shows that thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments the plausibility counterfactual and their counterfactual thinking about how situation could have turned out differently changes their judgements the causal role events and nonetheless their identification the cause and their counterfactual thought about how the event could have turned out differently not always people distinguish between various sorts strong and weak research the psychology reasoning shows that people make different sorts inferences from different sorts probabilistic causation probabilistic causation interpreting causation deterministic relation means that causes then must always followed this war does not cause nor does smoking cause cancer many turn notion probabilistic informally probabilistically causes occurrence increases the probability this sometimes interpreted reflect imperfect knowledge deterministic system but other times interpreted mean that the causal system under study inherently such quantum causal calculus when experiments are infeasible the derivation cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest some qualitative theoretical for that symptoms not cause usually expressed the form missing arrows causal graphs such bayesian networks path diagrams the mathematical theory underlying these derivations relies the distinction between conditional probabilities and interventional probabilities the former the probability finding cancer person known while the latter the probability finding cancer person forced the former statistical notion that can estimated directly observational while the latter causal notion also called causal which what estimate controlled randomized the theory causal permits one infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities causal bayesian networks with unmeasured one very practical result this theory the characterization confounding variables namely sufficient set variables adjusted would yield the correct causal effect between variables can shown that sufficient set for estimating the causal effect any set descendants that separate from after removing all arrows emanating from this called backdoor provides mathematical definition confounding and helps researchers identify accessible sets variables worthy structure learning while derivations causal calculus rely the structure the causal parts the causal structure under certain learned from statistical the basic idea goes back sewall wright work path analysis recovery algorithm was developed rebane and pearl which rests distinction between the three possible types causal substructures allowed directed acyclic graph type and type represent the same statistical dependencies and are independent given and therefore indistinguishable within purely cross sectional data type however can uniquely since and are marginally independent and all other pairs are thus while the skeletons the graphs stripped these three triplets are the directionality the arrows partially the same distinction applies when and have common except that one must first condition those algorithms have been developed systematically determine the skeleton the underlying graph then orient all arrows whose directionality dictated the conditional independencies alternative methods structure learning search through the many possible causal structures among the and remove ones which are strongly incompatible with the observed correlations general this leaves set possible causal which should then tested analyzing time series data preferably designing appropriately controlled experiments contrast with bayesian path analysis and its structural equation modeling serve better estimate known causal effect test causal model than generate causal for nonexperimental causal direction can often inferred information about time this because according though not theories causes must precede their effects this can determined statistical time series models for with statistical test based the idea granger causality direct experimental the use temporal data can permit statistical tests existing theory causal for our degree confidence the direction and nature causality much greater when supported cross correlations arima models cross spectral analysis using vector time series data than cross sectional data derivation theories the nobel prize holder herbert simon and philosopher nicholas rescher claim that the asymmetry the causal relation unrelated the asymmetry any mode implication that rather causal relation not relation between values but function one variable the another the given system and set variables appearing these can introduce asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly our commonsense notion causal the system equations must have certain most some values are chosen the remaining values will determined uniquely through path serial discovery that perfectly they postulate the inherent serialization such system equations may correctly capture causation all empirical including physics and manipulation theories some theorists have equated causality with under these causes only the case that one can change order change this coincides with commonsense notions since often ask causal questions order change some feature the for are interested knowing the causes crime that might find ways reducing these theories have been criticized two primary first theorists complain that these accounts are circular attempting reduce causal claims manipulation requires that manipulation more basic than causal but describing manipulations causal terms has provided substantial the second criticism centers around concerns anthropocentrism seems many people that causality some existing relationship the world that can harness for our causality identified with our then this intuition this makes humans overly central interactions the some attempts defend manipulability theories are recent accounts that claim reduce causality these accounts use manipulation sign feature causation without claiming that manipulation more fundamental than process theories some theorists are interested distinguishing between causal processes and causal processes russell salmon these theorists often want distinguish between process and pseudo process ball moving through the air contrasted with the motion shadow the former causal nature while the latter salmon claims that causal processes can identified their ability transmit alteration over space and alteration the ball mark perhaps carried with the ball goes through the the other hand alteration the shadow insofar will not transmitted the shadow moves these theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality not causal relationships causal but rather identifying causal the former notions can then defined terms causal why because herald free enterprise systemic causality george lakoff writes relation the cause hurricane sandy systemic because less more important systemic cause may one number multiple may require some special may working through network more direct may occurring with significantly high may require feedback causation biological economic and social systems tends not but less and because not direct requires all the greater attention understood and its negative effects above requires systemic fields axiom causality science within the frames dynamic method called the scientific method scientists set experiments normally with the end determining causality the physical for one may want know whether high intake carrots causes humans develop the bubonic plague observation correlation does not imply causation necessary use inductive reasoning from particular observations order strengthen through observed reproducibility disprove hypotheses about causal the fundamentally uncertain nature inductive reasoning has been claimed give rise scientific paradigm shifts described thomas kuhn this framework sometimes called the scientific method and forms part the philosophy science the dichotomy between hard and soft science can regarded stemming from the increased uncertainty and vagueness connected the inductive proofs causal links softer sciences physics causality informally physicists use the terminology cause and effect the same everyday fashion most other people the context physical theory itself for some physicists will say that forces cause motions however strictly this not the same formal theory causality not inherently implied equations motion but postulated additional constraint that needs satisfied cause always precedes its this constraint has mathematical implications such the kramers kronig relations causal notions appear physics the context where information what links cause its formally expected that information can not travel faster than the speed light since reference coordinate systems could constructed using the lorentz transform special relativity which observer would see effect precede its cause the postulate causality would causal notions also appear the related context the flow energy since energy flow generally considered linked information for commonplace make use the causality argument argue that the group velocity waves such electromagnetic can not exceed the speed causal notions are important general relativity the extent that have arrow time demands that the riemannian manifold that future and past are globally definable arguably the most prominent role causal notions however statistical the second law thermodynamics states that entropy which can thought measure disorder will always increase any closed see also the fluctuation theorem the irreversible increase entropy therefore provides another arrow which past and future can there stacked cube dice box and someone shakes the then the dice will longer stacked the process not shaking the box again will not cause the dice reassembled into neat formal physical definition such thing may related the second however while much has been written about this there not yet any generally accepted formal theory causation tied the second engineering causal system system with output and internal states that depends only the current and previous input system that has some dependence input values from the future addition possible past current input termed acausal system and system that depends solely future input values anticausal system acausal for can only exist postprocessing because these filters can extract future values from memory buffer biology medicine epidemiology austin bradford hill built upon the work hume and popper and suggested his paper the environment and association that aspects association such consistency specificity and temporality considered attempting distinguish causal from noncausal associations the epidemiological see bradford hill criteria did not note that temporality the only necessary criterion among those directed acyclic graphs are increasingly used epidemiology help enlighten causal psychology causal reasoning psychologists take empirical approach investigating how people and human animals detect infer causation from sensory prior experience and innate knowledge attribution attribution theory the theory concerning how people explain individual occurrences attribution can external assigning causality outside agent force claiming that some outside thing motivated the internal assigning causality factors within the person taking personal responsibility accountability for actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the taking causation one step the type attribution person provides influences their future the intention behind the cause the effect can covered the subject action see also accident blame intent and causal powers whereas david hume argued that causes are inferred from causal immanuel kant claimed that people have innate assumptions about within patricia cheng attempted reconcile the humean and kantian according her power people filter observations events through basic belief that causes have the power generate their thereby inferring specific effect causation and salience our view causation depends what consider the relevant another way view the lightning causes see both lightning and thunder two perceptions the same viz electric discharge that perceive first visually and then naming and causality david sobel and alison gopnik from the psychology department berkeley designed device known the blicket detector which would turn when object was placed their research suggests that even young children will easily and swiftly learn about new causal power object and spontaneously use that information classifying and naming the perception launching events some researchers such anjan chatterjee the university pennsylvania and jonathan fugelsang the university waterloo are using neuroscience techniques investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings causal launching events which one object causes another object both temporal and spatial factors can see causal reasoning for more statistics and economics statistics and economics usually employ existing data experimental data infer causality regression the body statistical techniques involves substantial use regression analysis typically linear relationship such which the observation the dependent variable hypothesized the caused for the observation the independent variable hypothesized causative and the error term for the observation containing the combined effects all other causative which must uncorrelated with the included independent there reason believe that none the caused then estimates the coefficients are the null hypothesis that then the alternative hypothesis that and equivalently that causes cannot the other the null hypothesis that cannot then equivalently the hypothesis causal effect cannot here the notion causality one contributory causality discussed above the true value then change will result change unless some other causative either included the regression implicit the error change such way exactly offset its thus change not sufficient change likewise change not necessary change because change could caused something implicit the error term some other causative explanatory variable included the the above way testing for causality requires belief that there reverse which would cause this belief can established one several first the variable may economic for rainfall amount hypothesized affect the futures price some agricultural impossible that fact the futures price affects rainfall amount provided that cloud seeding never second the instrumental variables technique may employed remove any reverse causation introducing role for other variables that are known unaffected the dependent third the principle that effects cannot precede causes can including the right side the regression only variables that precede time the dependent this principle for testing for granger causality and its multivariate vector autoregression both which control for lagged values the dependent variable while testing for causal effects lagged independent regression analysis controls for other relevant variables including them regressors explanatory this helps avoid false inferences causality due the presence underlying variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused its effect the potentially caused variable captured directly including the that effect will not picked indirect effect through the potentially causative variable management ishikawa diagram for quality control manufacturing the kaoru ishikawa developed cause and effect known ishikawa diagram fishbone the diagram categorizes such into the six main categories shown these categories are then ishikawa method identifies causes brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved the manufacturing these groups can then labeled categories the the use these diagrams has now spread beyond quality and they are used other areas management and design and ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient seems that ishikawa was not even aware this humanities history the discussion events are sometimes considered some way being agents that can then bring about other historical thus the combination poor the hardships the high lack representation the and kingly ineptitude are among the causes the french revolution this somewhat platonic and hegelian view that reifies causes ontological entities aristotelian this use approximates the case the efficient cause some philosophers history such arthur danto have claimed that explanations history and describe not simply event something that happens but like many practicing they treat causes intersecting actions and sets actions which bring about larger decide what are the elements which persist through rather when treating shift but considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when are interested such change say the feudalism the
