citation needed this led politicians the time pass the poor law amendment act which limited the provision social because classical liberals believed unfettered the mechanism that will most efficiently lead adopting thomas malthus population they saw poor urban conditions they believed population growth would outstrip food and they considered that starvation would help limit population they opposed any income wealth which they believed would dissipated the lowest classical liberals agreed with thomas hobbes that government had been created individuals protect themselves from one they thought that individuals should free pursue their interest without control restraint individuals should free obtain work from the paying while the profit motive would ensure that products that people desired were produced prices they would free both labour and capital would receive the greatest possible while production would organised efficiently meet consumer drawing selected ideas adam smith classical liberals believed that all individuals are able equally freely pursue their own economic without government serving the common they were critical welfare state interfering free they criticized group

traditions within classical the british and the french hayek saw the british philosophers bernard mandeville david hume adam adam ferguson josiah tucker edmund burke and william paley representative tradition that articulated beliefs empiricism the common law and traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly the french tradition included rousseau condorcet the encyclopedists and the physiocrats this tradition believed rationalism and sometimes showed hostility tradition and hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond those belonging each hayek saw the frenchmen montesquieu constant and tocqueville belonging the british and the british thomas hobbes priestley richard price and thomas paine belonging the french hayek also rejected the label laissez faire originating from the french tradition and alien the beliefs smith and history classical liberalism britain developed from whiggery and radicalism and represented new political whiggery had become dominant ideology following the glorious revolution and was associated with the defence upholding the rule law and defending landed property the origins rights were seen being ancient which had existed from time immemorial these which some whigs considered include freedom the press and freedom were justified custom rather than natural rights they believed that the power the executive had while they supported limited they saw voting rather than however there was consistency whig and diverse writers including john locke david adam smith and edmund burke were all influential among although none them was universally british from the the concentrated parliamentary and electoral emphasizing natural rights and popular richard price and joseph priestley adapted the language locke the ideology the radicals saw parliamentary reform first step toward dealing with their many including the treatment protestant dissenters the slave high prices and high there was greater unity classical liberalism ideology than there had been with classical liberals were committed liberty and equal they believed that required free economy with minimal government writers such john bright and richard cobden opposed both aristocratic privilege and which they saw impediment the development class yeoman farmers some elements whiggery opposed this new and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature classical these elements became associated with anti corn law league exeter hall classical liberalism was the dominant political theory britain from the early century until the first world its notable victories were the catholic emancipation act the reform act and the repeal the corn laws the anti corn law league brought together coalition liberal and radical groups support free trade under the leadership richard cobden and john bright who opposed militarism and public their policies low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted william ewart gladstone when became chancellor the exchequer and later prime classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and nonconformism although classical liberals aspired minimum state they accepted the principle government intervention the economy from the early century with passage the factory acts from around laissez faire advocates the manchester school and writers the economist were confident that their early victories would lead period expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace but would face reversals government intervention and activity continued expand from the jeremy bentham and james mill although advocates laissez faire non intervention foreign and individual believed that social institutions could rationally redesigned through the principles utilitarianism the conservative prime benjamin disraeli rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated tory democracy the herbert spencer and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against the first world the liberal party had largely abandoned classical liberal the changing economic and social conditions the century led division between classical and social liberals while agreeing the importance individual differed the role the neo classical who called themselves true saw second treatise the best and emphasised limited while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare herbert spencer britain and william graham sumner were the leading classical liberal theorists the neo classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary with writers such robert nozick the united liberalism took strong root because had little opposition its whereas europe liberalism was opposed many reactionary nation especially farmers whose workers were little attention was paid the economic aspects thomas jefferson adopted many the ideals liberalism the declaration independence changed liberty and the more socially liberal liberty and the pursuit america industry became larger and larger part american and during the term first populist andrew jackson economic questions came the the economic ideas the jacksonian era were almost universally the ideas classical freedom was maximised when the government took hands attitude toward industrial development and supported the value the currency freely exchanging paper money for the ideas classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until series depressions thought impossible according the tenets classical economics led economic hardship from which the voters demanded the words william jennings bryan you shall not crucify the american farmer cross gold classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among american businessmen until the great depression the great depression saw sea change leading the development modern liberalism the words arthur schlesinger when the growing complexity industrial conditions required increasing government intervention order assure more equal the liberal faithful the goal rather than the dogma altered its view the and there emerged the conception social welfare state which the national government had the express obligation maintain high levels employment the supervise standards life and regulate the methods business and establish comprehensive patterns social intellectual sources john locke john locke john locke central classical liberal ideology was their interpretation john second treatise government and letter concerning toleration which had been written defence the glorious revolution although these writings were considered too radical the time for new they later came cited radicals and supporters the american however much later liberal thought was absent writings scarcely and his writings have been subject various there little for constitutionalism the separation powers and limited government james richardson identified five central themes individualism consent the concepts the rule law and government the significance and religious although locke did not develop theory natural envisioned individuals the state nature being free and the rather than the community was the point locke believed that individuals had given consent government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from this belief would influence later revolutionary government was expected serve the interests the not the and rulers were expected follow the laws enacted locke also held that the main purpose men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation their despite the ambiguity definition which limited property much land man plants improves cultivates and can use the product this principle held great appeal individuals possessed great locke held that the individual had the right follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose religion against dissenters but there were tolerance should shown for atheists who were seen catholics who were seen owing allegiance the pope over their own national adam smith adam smith adam smith adam the wealth nations published was provide most the ideas least until the publication mill principles smith addressed the motivation for economic the causes prices and the distribution and the policies the state should follow order maximise smith wrote that long demand prices and competition were left free government the pursuit material rather than would maximize the wealth society through driven production goods and invisible hand directed individuals and firms work toward the good unintended consequence efforts maximize their own this provided moral justification for the accumulation which had previously been viewed some assumed that workers could paid low was necessary for their which was later transformed ricardo and malthus into the iron law wages his main emphasis was the benefit free internal and international which thought could increase wealth through specialization also opposed restrictive trade state grants and organisations and trade government should limited public works and the administration financed taxes based smith economics was carried into practice the nineteenth century with the lowering tariffs the the repeal the poor relief act that had restricted the mobility and the end the rule the east india company over india say malthus and ricardo jean baptiste say thomas malthus david ricardo addition adam say law malthus theories population and iron law wages became central doctrines classical the pessimistic nature these theories led carlyle calling economics the dismal science and provided basis criticism capitalism its jean baptiste say was french economist who introduced adam economic theories into france and whose commentaries smith were read both france and say challenged labour theory value believing that prices were determined utility and also emphasised the critical role the entrepreneur the however neither those observations became accepted british economists the his most important contribution economic thinking was which was interpreted classical economists that there could overproduction and that there would always balance between supply and this general belief influenced government policies until the following this since the economic cycle was seen government did not intervene during periods economic hardship because was seen thomas malthus wrote two essay the principle population published and principles political economy published the second book which was rebuttal law had little influence contemporary his first book however became major influence classical that malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food because population grew while food production grew people were provided with they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food nature would then provide check growth the forms vice and gains income could prevent and any welfare for the poor would the poor were fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through david ricardo who was admirer adam covered many the same topics but while smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical ricardo used drawing conclusions reasoning from basic while ricardo accepted labour theory value acknowledged that utility could influence the price some rare rents agricultural land were seen the production that was surplus the subsistence required the wages were seen the amount required for subsistence and maintain current population according his iron law wages wages could never rise beyond subsistence ricardo explained profits return which itself was the product but conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was surplus appropriated capitalists which they were not utilitarianism utilitarianism utilitarianism provided the political justification for implementation economic liberalism british which was dominate economic policy from the although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and john stuart mill later writings the subject foreshadowed the welfare was mainly used justification for laissez faire the central concept which was developed jeremy bentham was that public policy should seek provide the greatest happiness the greatest while this could interpreted justification for state action reduce was used classical liberals justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit all individuals would political economy classical liberals saw utility the foundation for public this broke both with conservative tradition and lockean natural which were seen utility which emphasises the happiness became the central ethical value all although utilitarianism inspired ranging became primarily justification for laissez faire economics however classical liberals rejected adam smith belief that the invisible hand would lead general benefits and embraced thomas robert malthus view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and david ricardo view the inevitability class laissez faire was seen the only possible economic and any government intervention was seen useless and the poor law amendment act was defended scientific economic while the authors the elizabethan poor law were seen not having had the benefit reading commitment laissez faire however was not some economists advocated state support public works and classical liberals were also divided free trade ricardo for expressed doubt that the removal grain tariffs advocated richard cobden and the anti corn law league would have any general most classical liberals also supported legislation regulate the number hours that children were allowed work and usually did not oppose factory reform despite the pragmatism classical their views were expressed dogmatic terms such popular writers jane marcet and harriet martineau the strongest defender laissez faire was the economist founded james wilson the economist criticised ricardo for his lack support for free trade and expressed hostility believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic the economist took the position that regulation factory hours was harmful workers and also strongly opposed state support for health the provision and granting patents and the economist also campaigned against the corn laws that protected landlords the united kingdom great britain and ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports cereal rigid belief laissez faire guided the government response the great famine during which estimated million people the minister responsible for economic and financial charles wood expected that private enterprise and free rather than government would alleviate the the corn laws were finally repealed removal tariffs grain which kept the price bread artificially however repeal the corn laws came too late stop irish partly because was done stages over three free trade and world peace several including adam smith and richard cobden argued that the free exchange goods between nations could lead world peace view recognised such modern american political scientists robert alan dahl michael doyle bruce martin rassett and john robert oneal erik gartzke columbia university scholars like adam richard norman angell and richard rosecrance have long speculated that free markets have the potential free states from the looming prospect recurrent american political scientists john oneal and bruce russett well known for their work the democratic peace state the classical liberals advocated policies increase liberty and they sought empower the commercial class politically and abolish royal monopolies and the protectionist policies mercantilism encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive they also expected democracy and faire economics diminish the frequency adam smith argued the wealth nations that societies progressed from hunter gatherers

and benefited small but concentrated elite summing british imperialism which believed was the result the economic restrictions mercantilist policies and many classical those who advocated peace must also advocate free relationship modern liberalism many modern scholars liberalism argue that particularly meaningful distinction between classical and modern liberalism alan wolfe summarises this which reject any such distinction and instead for the existence continuous liberal understanding that includes both adam smith and john maynard keynes the idea that liberalism comes two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind how much government intervenes into the when instead discuss human purpose and the meaning adam smith and john maynard keynes are the same both them
