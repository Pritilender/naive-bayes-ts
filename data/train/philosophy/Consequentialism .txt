any particular john stuart mill his exposition hedonistic proposed hierarchy meaning that the pursuit certain kinds pleasure more highly valued than the pursuit other however some contemporary such peter singer are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction hence preference utilitarianism other contemporary forms utilitarianism mirror the forms consequentialism outlined ethical egoism ethical egoism ethical egoism can understood consequentialist theory according which the consequences for the individual agent are taken matter more than any other thus egoism will prescribe actions that may detrimental neutral the welfare some like henry sidgwick argue that certain degree egoism promotes the general welfare society for two because individuals know how please themselves and because everyone were austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably ethical altruism altruism ethical altruism can seen consequentialist ethic which prescribes that individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for this was advocated auguste comte who coined the term and whose ethics can summed the live for rule consequentialism consequentialist theories focus however this need not the rule consequentialism theory that sometimes seen attempt reconcile deontology and and some this stated criticism rule like rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain however rule consequentialism chooses rules based the consequences that the selection those rules rule consequentialism exists the forms rule utilitarianism and rule egoism various theorists are split whether the rules are the only determinant moral behavior for robert nozick holds that certain set minimal which calls are necessary ensure appropriate there are also differences how absolute these moral rules thus while constraints are absolute restrictions amartya sen proposes theory that recognizes the importance certain but these rules are not that they may violated strict adherence the rule would lead much more undesirable one the most common objections consequentialism that because based the consequentialist principle that what should concerned with maximizing the but then tells not act maximize the but follow rules even cases where know that breaking the rule could produce better brad hooker avoided this objection not basing his form

reverting generally reliable moral rules when one not position stand back and examine the dilemma this equates adhering rule consequentialism when one can only reason intuitive and act consequentialism when position stand back and reason more critical citation needed this position can described reconciliation between act consequentialism which the morality action determined that effects and rule consequentialism which moral behavior derived from following rules that lead positive citation needed the level approach consequentialism most often associated with hare and peter singer citation needed motive consequentialism another consequentialist version motive consequentialism which looks the state affairs that results from the motive choose action better least good each the alternative state affairs that would have resulted from alternative this version gives relevance the motive act and links its act can therefore not wrong the decision act was based right possible inference that one can not blamed for mistaken judgements the motivation was negative consequentialism most consequentialist theories focus promoting some sort good however one could equally well lay out consequentialist theory that focuses solely minimizing bad negative utilitarianism actual one major difference between these two approaches the positive consequentialism demands that bring about good states whereas negative consequentialism requires that avoid bad stronger versions negative consequentialism will require active intervention prevent bad and ameliorate existing weaker simple

after words but who endures the end will citation needed utilitarian the other must answer the charge that ends not justify the the problem arises these theories because they tend separate the achieved ends from the action which these ends were one implication utilitarianism that intention performing act may include all its foreseen the goodness the intention then reflects the balance the good and evil these with limits imposed upon the nature the act even say the breaking promise the execution innocent utilitarianism answering this must show either that what apparently immoral not

holds that action judged solely its most consequentialist theories hold that deliberate action different from deliberate decision not this contrasts with the acts and omissions which upheld some medical ethicists and some asserts there significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate actions which lead the same this contrast brought out issues such voluntary euthanasia pure

consequences are what primarily stake here the responsibility the citation needed the ideal observer one common tactic among particularly those committed altruistic account employ neutral observer from which moral judgements can john rawls critic argues that common with other forms relies the perspective such ideal the particular characteristics this ideal observer can vary from omniscient who would grasp all the consequences any ideally informed who knows much could reasonably but not necessarily all the circumstances all the possible consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal citation needed the real observer very and times arguably adopt the point view ideal individual moral agents not know everything about their particular and thus not know all the possible consequences their potential for this some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents choose the best action line with what they know about the however this approach vely then moral agents for recklessly fail reflect their and act way that brings about terrible could said acting morally justifiable acting situation without first informing oneself the circumstances the situation can lead even the most intended actions yielding miserable could argued that there moral imperative for agent inform himself much possible about situation before judging the appropriate course this derived from consequential informed agent able bring about better citation needed consequences for whom whistleblowing moral action always has effect certain people the various kinds consequentialism can differentiated beneficiary the good that one might ask consequences for agent focused neutral fundamental distinction can drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives and theories which permit that agents act for ends which they have some personal interest motivation these are called and theories agent neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value state affairs has for any particular thus neutral personal goals not count any more than anyone goals evaluating what action the actor should agent focused the other focuses the particular needs the moral thus focused such one that peter railton outlines the agent might concerned with the general but the agent more concerned with the immediate welfare herself and her friends and these two approaches could reconciled acknowledging the tension between interests individual and member various and seeking somehow optimize among all these citation needed for may meaningful speak action being good for someone individual but bad for them citizen their human many consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human however some philosophers argue that should not limit our ethical consideration the interests human beings jeremy bentham who regarded the founder utilitarianism argues that animals can experience pleasure and thus demanding that human should serious object moral more peter singer has argued that unreasonable that not give equal consideration the interests animals those human beings when choose the way are treat such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment humans and any more than necessarily implies identical treatment all kinds consequences one way divide various consequentialisms the types consequences that are taken matter

one might fix psychological goods the relevant thus one might pursue increase material equality political liberty instead something like the more ephemeral pleasure other theories adopt package several all promoted virtue ethics consequentialism can also contrasted with aretaic moral theories such virtue ethics whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences action should the

consequentialism alienating because requires moral agents put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents take strictly impersonal view all since only the and not who produces that said williams argues that this demands too much moral since consequentialism demands that they willing sacrifice any and all personal
