fatalism hypothesis justification nihilism probability scientific theory skepticism solipsism theory truth uncertainty determinism the philosophical position that for every including human there exist conditions that could cause other there are many depending upon what conditions are considered determinative deterministic theories throughout the history philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and some forms determinism can empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy physics the opposite determinism some kind indeterminism otherwise called nondeterminism determinism often contrasted with free will and moral responsibility determinism often taken mean causal determinism which physics known the concept that events within given paradigm are bound causality such way that any state object completely determined prior this meaning can distinguished from other varieties determinism mentioned other debates often concern the scope determined with some maintaining that the entire universe single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems multiverse numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties they include debates concerning determinism and free will technically denoted compatibilistic allowing the two and incompatibilistic denying their coexistence determinism should not confused with self determination human actions motives and determinism rarely requires that perfect prediction practically contents varieties philosophical connections with

varieties this article needs attention from expert philosophy please add reason talk parameter this template explain the issue with the wikiproject philosophy its portal may able help recruit july below appear some the more common viewpoints meant confused with determinism causal determinism the idea that every event necessitated antecedent events and conditions together with the laws however causal determinism broad enough term consider that choices and actions will often necessary links the causal chain that brings something other even though our choices and actions are themselves determined like everything still the according causal that the occurrence existence yet other things depends upon our choosing and acting certain causal determinism proposes that there unbroken chain prior occurrences stretching back the origin the the relation between events may not nor the origin that causal determinists believe that there nothing uncaused self caused historical determinism sort path dependence can also synonymous with causal causal determinism has also been considered more generally the idea that everything that happens exists caused antecedent the case nomological these conditions are considered events implying that the future determined completely preceding events combination prior states the universe and the laws yet they can also considered metaphysical origin such the case theological nomological determinism the most common form causal the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily rigid natural that every occurrence results inevitably from prior quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereof pose serious challenge this nomological determinism sometimes illustrated the thought experiment laplace demon nomological determinism sometimes called determinism although that physical determinism generally used synonymously with nomological determinism its opposite being physical indeterminism necessitarianism very related the causal determinism described metaphysical principle that denies all mere there exactly one way for the world leucippus claimed there were uncaused and that everything occurs for reason and predeterminism the idea that all events are determined the concept predeterminism often argued invoking causal implying that there unbroken chain prior occurrences stretching back the origin the the case this chain events has been and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes this established predeterminism can used mean such established causal which case categorised specific type can also used interchangeably with causal determinism the context its capacity determine future despite predeterminism often considered independent causal the term predeterminism also frequently used the context biology and which case represents form biological determinism fatalism normally distinguished from determinism fatalism the idea that everything fated that humans have control over their fate has arbitrary and need not follow any causal otherwise deterministic laws types fatalism include hard theological determinism and the idea predestination where there god who determines all that humans will this may accomplished either knowing their actions via some form omniscience decreeing their actions theological determinism form determinism which states that all events that happen are predestined monotheistic deity that they are destined occur given its omniscience two forms theological determinism here referenced strong and weak theological the first strong theological based the concept creator deity dictating all events everything that happens has been predestined happen omnipotent the second weak theological based the concept divine foreknowledge because god omniscience what god knows about the future will inevitably which consequently that the future already there exist slight variations the above some claim that theological determinism requires predestination all events and outcomes the divinity they not classify the weaker version theological unless libertarian free will assumed denied that the weaker version does not constitute theological with respect free theological determinism the thesis that god exists and has infallible knowledge all true propositions including propositions about our future more minimal criteria designed encapsulate all forms theological theological determinism can also seen form causal which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will logical determinism determinateness the notion that all whether about the present are either true false note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa depending views the nature time but also randomness the problem free will especially salient now with logical how can choices given that propositions about the future already have truth value the present already determined either true this referred the problem future contingents the fact that often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind temporal determinism eternalism the view special smart proponent this uses the term tenselessness describe the simultaneous existence present and the block hermann minkowski and albert einstein assumes that time fourth dimension like the three spatial other all the other parts time are like the city blocks and down although the order which they appear depends the driver see rietdijk putnam argument adequate determinism the idea that quantum indeterminacy can ignored for most macroscopic this because quantum decoherence random quantum events average the limit large numbers particles where the laws quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws classical stephen hawking explains similar says that the microscopic world quantum mechanics one determined that quantum effects rarely alter the predictions classical mechanics which are quite accurate albeit still not perfectly certain larger something large animal cell then would adequately even light quantum philosophical connections with nurture controversy although some the above forms determinism concern human behaviors and cognition others frame themselves answer the debate nature and nurture they will suggest that one factor will entirely determine scientific understanding has however the strongest versions these theories have been widely rejected single cause fallacy other the modern deterministic theories attempt explain how the interaction both nature and nurture entirely the concept heritability has been helpful make this biological determinism sometimes called genetic determinism the idea that each our beliefs and desires are fixed our genetic behaviorism the idea that all behavior can traced specific either environmental this focused determinism was developed john watson and skinner cultural determinism social determinism the focused theory that the culture which are raised that determines who environmental determinism also known climatic geographical holds the view that the physical rather than social determines supporters often also support behavioral determinism key proponents this notion have included ellen churchill ellsworth thomas griffith taylor and possibly jared although his status environmental determinist with particular factors other theories actually seek only highlight the importance particular factor predicting the these theories often use the factor sort guide constraint the they need not suppose that complete knowledge that one factor would allow make perfect psychological determinism can mean that humans must act according but can also synonymous with some sort psychological egoism the latter the view that humans will always act according their perceived best linguistic determinism claims that our language determines least the things can think and say and thus the sapir whorf hypothesis argues that individuals experience the world based the grammatical structures they habitually economic determinism the theory which attributes primacy the economic structure over politics the development human associated with the dialectical materialism karl marx technological determinism reductionist theory that presumes that technology drives the development its social structure and cultural with free will free will philosophers have debated both the truth and the truth free this creates the four possible positions the compatibilism refers the view that free will some compatible with the three incompatibilist positions the other deny this the hard incompatibilists hold that both determinism and free will not the libertarianists that determinism does not and free will might and the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free will does not the standard argument against free will according philosopher smart focuses the implications determinism for free however suggests free will denied whether determinism true one determinism all our actions are predicted and are assumed not the other determinism our actions are presumed random and such not seem free because had part controlling what his the moral landscape author and neuroscientist sam harris also argues against incompatibilist free offers one thought experiment where mad scientist represents example the mad scientist uses machine control all the and thus all the particular harris believes that longer this say the victim has free harris says nothing changes the machine controls desires random the victim still seems lack free harris then argues that are also the victims such unpredictable desires but due the unconscious machinations our rather than those mad based this writes this discloses the real mystery free our experience compatible with its utter how can say that see any evidence for the first adding that whether they are predictable not cause our that believes there compelling evidence absence free harris viewpoint implicitly assumes philosophy materialism that that mental events are reducible neurological some research founded the john templeton foundation suggested that reducing belief free will making them less helpful and more this could occur because the sense self efficacy suffers with the soul some determinists argue that materialism does not present complete understanding the because while can describe determinate interactions among material ignores the minds souls conscious number positions can immaterial souls are all that exist idealism immaterial souls exist and exert deterministic causal influence traditional interactionist dualism immaterial souls but are part deterministic immaterial souls but exert causal free determined epiphenomenalism occasionalism immaterial souls not exist there mind body dichotomy and there materialistic explanation for intuitions the with ethics and morality another topic debate the implication that determinism has morality hard determinism belief and not free particularly criticized for seeming make traditional moral judgments some however find this acceptable philosopher and incompatibilist peter van inwagen introduces this thesis argument that free will required for moral judgments the moral judgment that you have done implies that you should have done something else instead that you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you that there was something else for you implies that you could have done something else that you could have done something else implies that you have free will you have free will have done other than cannot make the moral judgment that you have done however compatibilist might have issue with process because one can not change the past like his arguments center compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might the moral judgment that you have done implies that you can something else instead that you can something else instead implies that there something else for you that there something else for you implies that you can something else that you can something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse you have free will other than can make the moral judgment that you should other than and punishing you responsible party for having done that you know you should not have done can help you remember not the history some the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are marcus aurelius omar thomas hobbes baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz david hume baron holbach paul heinrich pierre simon laplace arthur schopenhauer william james friedrich nietzsche albert einstein niels bohr ralph waldo emerson and more john searle ted honderich and daniel dennett mecca chiesa notes that

stoics part their theory universal causal the resulting philosophical which involved the confluence elements aristotelian ethics with stoic led the centuries the works alexander aphrodisias the first recorded western debate over determinism and issue that known theology the paradox free will the writings epictetus well middle platonist and early christian thought were instrumental this the jewish philosopher moses maimonides said the deterministic implications omniscient does god know does not know that certain individual will good thou sayest then necessarily follows that man compelled act god knew beforehand would otherwise knowledge would determinism the west often associated with newtonian physics which depicts the physical matter the universe operating according set knowable the billiard hypothesis product newtonian argues that once the initial conditions the universe have been the rest the history the universe follows were actually possible have complete knowledge physical matter and all the laws governing that matter any one then would theoretically possible compute the time and place every event that will ever occur laplace demon this the basic particles the universe operate the same fashion the rolling balls billiard moving and striking each other predictable ways produce predictable whether not encompassing newtonian mechanics deals only with caused object begins known position and hit dead object with some known then will pushed straight toward another predictable goes somewhere the newtonians one must question measurements the original position the the exact direction the striking gravitational other fields that were inadvertently etc then they repeated experiments and improvements accuracy will always bring observations closer the theoretically predicted when dealing with situations ordinary human newtonian physics has been enormously successful that has but fails spectacularly velocities become some substantial fraction the speed light and when interactions the atomic scale are before the discovery quantum effects and other challenges newtonian uncertainty was always term that applied the accuracy human knowledge about causes and and not the causes and effects newtonian mechanics well any following physical theories are results observations and and they describe how all within however old western scientists believed there are any logical connections found between observed cause and there must also some absolute natural laws belief perfect natural laws driving instead just describing what should led searching for set universal simple laws that rule the this movement significantly encouraged deterministic views western well the related theological views classical pantheism modern scientific perspective generative processes emergence although was once thought scientists that any indeterminism quantum mechanics occurred too small scale influence biological neurological there indication that nervous systems are influenced quantum indeterminism due chaos theory unclear what implications this has for free will given various possible reactions the standard problem the first not all biologists grant christof koch argues against and favour libertarian free will making arguments based generative processes emergence other proponents emergentist generative philosophy cognitive sciences and evolutionary psychology argue that determinism they suggest instead that illusion free will experienced due the generation infinite behaviour from the interaction deterministic set rules and parameters thus the unpredictability the emerging behaviour from deterministic processes leads perception free even though free will ontological entity does not certain experiments looking the neuroscience free will can said support this citation needed game life the strategy games chess and have rigorous rules which information such face hidden from either player and random events such happen within the yet chess and especially with its extremely simple deterministic can still have extremely large number unpredictable when chess simplified fewer however there are endgame tables available which dictate which moves play achieve perfect the implication this that given less complex environment with the original pieces reduced fewer perfectly predictable game chess possible this the winning player would able announce checkmate happening most given number moves assuming perfect defense the losing less moves the defending player chooses optimal moves the game progresses into its predicted this the experience free will emerges from the interaction finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behaviourial all these events could accounted and there were known way evaluate these the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become another example generative processes john horton conway playable game life nassim taleb wary such and coined the term ludic fallacy mathematical models many mathematical models physical systems are this true most models involving differential equations those measuring rate change over mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called stochastic because sensitive dependence initial conditions some deterministic models may appear behave such deterministic interpretation the model may not useful due numerical instability and finite amount precision such considerations can motivate the consideration stochastic model even though the underlying system governed deterministic quantum mechanics and classical physics day day physics macroscopic quantum phenomena since the beginning the quantum mechanics the physics the extremely has revealed previously concealed aspects events before newtonian physics the physics everyday taken isolation rather than approximation quantum newtonian physics depicts universe which objects move perfectly determined the scale where humans exist and interact with the newtonian mechanics remain and make relatively accurate predictions calculating the trajectory but whereas absolute knowledge the forces accelerating bullet would produce absolutely accurate prediction its modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt this main thesis relevant the fact that certainty never absolute practice and not just because david problem induction the equations newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence initial this example the butterfly effect which one the subjects chaos theory the idea that something even small butterfly could cause chain reaction leading hurricane years consequently even very small error knowledge initial conditions can result arbitrarily large deviations from predicted chaos theory thus explains why may practically impossible predict real whether determinism true the other the issue may not much about human abilities predict attain certainty much the nature reality for scientific look nature quantum realm quantum physics works differently many ways from newtonian physicist aaron connell explains that understanding our such small scales requires different logic than day life connell does not deny that all the scale human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum connell argues that must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum quantum mechanics the product careful application the scientific method logic and empiricism the heisenberg uncertainty principle frequently confused with the observer effect the uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely may measure the position and momentum particle the same time increase the accuracy measuring one are forced lose accuracy measuring the these uncertainty relations give that measure freedom from the limitations classical concepts which necessary for consistent description atomic this where statistical mechanics come into and where physicists begin require rather unintuitive mental path simply cannot exactly specified its full quantum path practical attribute our every day but one which quantum particles not meaningfully the probabilities discovered quantum mechanics nevertheless arise from measurement the perceived path the stephen hawking explains the result not traditional but rather determined some quantum particle may indeed trace exact and the probability finding the particles that path one clarification needed far prediction the quantum development least predictable the classical but the key that describes wave functions that cannot easily expressed ordinary far the thesis determinism these are quite these findings from quantum mechanics have found many applications and allow build transistors and lasers put another personal blu ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities the quantum none that should taken imply that other aspects quantum mechanics are not still for debate the topic predictable the double slit experiments are popular photons are fired one through slit apparatus distant curiously they not arrive any single nor even the two points lined with the slits the way you might expect bullets fired fixed gun distant instead the light arrives varying concentrations widely separated and the distribution its collisions with the target can calculated that sense the behavior light this apparatus but there way predict where the resulting interference pattern any individual photon will make its contribution there may ways use weak measurement acquire more information without violating the uncertainty principle some including albert einstein argue that our inability predict any more than probabilities simply due the idea beyond the conditions and laws can observe there are also hidden factors hidden variables that determine absolutely which order photons reach the detector they argue that the course the universe absolutely but that humans are screened from knowledge the determinative they only appears that things proceed merely probabilistically determinative they proceed absolutely deterministic these matters continue subject some critical finding was that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions which would violated local hidden variables really there have been number experiments verify such and far they not appear this would suggest there are hidden although many physicists believe better experiments are needed conclusively settle the issue see also bell test experiments furthermore possible augment quantum mechanics with local hidden variables achieve deterministic theory that agreement with example the bohm interpretation quantum this debate relevant because easy imagine specific situations which the arrival electron screen certain point and time would trigger one whereas its arrival another point would trigger entirely different event see schr cat thought experiment used part deeper thus quantum physics casts reasonable doubt the traditional determinism newtonian physics far reality does not seem absolutely this was the subject the famous bohr einstein debates between einstein and niels bohr and there still consensus adequate determinism see varieties above the reason that stephen hawking calls libertarian free will just compatibilistic free will which may the only kind free that can however daniel his book elbow room says that this means have the only kind free will worth for even more see free will other matters quantum determinism all uranium found earth thought have been

quantum mechanics more strongly ordered than classical because while classical mechanics chaotic quantum mechanics for the classical problem three bodies under force such gravity not integrable while the quantum mechanical three body problem tractable and using the faddeev equations clarification needed this does not mean that quantum mechanics describes the world more unless one already considers the wave function the true even this does not get rid the because anything without using classical but assigns the probabilities the classical rather than the quantum asserting that quantum mechanics deterministic treating the wave function itself reality implies single wave function for the entire universe starting the origin the such wave function would carry the probabilities not just the world
