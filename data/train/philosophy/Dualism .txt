dualistic and monist philosophies since each has supreme and transcendental first principle from which the two opposite entities then this also true for the known christian gnostic religions such bogomils catharism and more complex forms monist dualism also for instance hermeticism where nous thought that described have created man brings forth both good and dependent whether receives prompting from the god from the duality with pluralism considered logical history moral dualism began theological dualism was first seen implicitly egyptian religious beliefs the contrast the gods set death and osiris life the first explicit conception dualism came from the ancient persian religion zoroastrianism around the fifth century zoroastrianism monotheistic religion that believes that ahura mazda the eternal creator all good any violations ahura order arise from druj which everything from this comes significant choice for humans either they fully participate human life for ahura mazda they not and give druj personal dualism even more distinct the beliefs later the religious dualism christianity between good and evil not perfect dualism god will inevitably destroy satan early christian dualism largely based platonic dualism neoplatonism and christianity there also personal dualism christianity with body distinction based the idea immaterial christian duotheism bitheism ditheism dualistic cosmology theology may also refer although bitheism imply moral they are not ditheism bitheism implies two while moral dualism does not imply any theism theos god whatsoever both and imply belief two equally powerful gods with complementary antonymous however while bitheism implies ditheism implies rivalry and such between good and bright and summer and for ditheistic system would one which one god the other destructive theodicy the original conception zoroastrianism for ahura mazda was the spirit ultimate while ahriman angra mainyu was the spirit ultimate this zoroastrian conception polar opposition and conflict would later come influence the development christianity elaborated upon the idea the devil ultimate source evil opposed the christian idea that was previously absent citation needed bitheistic where the two deities are not conflict one could male and the other female duotheism one known example bitheistic duotheistic theology based gender polarity found the neopagan religion wicca which centered the worship divine couple the moon goddess and the horned god who are regarded however there also ditheistic theme within traditional the horned god has dual aspects bright and dark relating summer winter expressed the oak king and the holly who wiccan myth and ritual are said engage battle twice year for the hand the resulting the changing within bright and dark not correspond notions good and evil but are aspects the natural much like yin and yang however bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always easily for instance system where one god the representative summer and drought and the other winter and fertility the mythology persephone marcionism early christian held that the old and new testaments were the work two opposing both were first but different ontological dualism yin and yang dualism can mean the tendency humans perceive and understand the world being divided into two overarching categories this dualistic when one perceives tree thing separate from everything surrounding this form ontological dualism exists taoism and beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions yin and yang traditions such classical zen buddhism islamic sufism key enlightenment transcending this sort dualistic without merely substituting dualism with monism pluralism chinese philosophy the opposition and combination the two basic principles yin and yang large part chinese philosophy and important feature taoism both philosophy and yin and yang also discussed confucianism but lesser some the common associations with yang and respectively are male and light and dark active and motion and the yin and yang symbol actuality has very little with western instead represents the philosophy where two opposites exist harmony and are able transmute into each the yang symbol there dot yin yang and dot yang this symbolizes the connectedness the opposite forces different aspects the first contrast needed create distinguishable without which would experience therefore the independent principles yin and yang are actually dependent one another for each distinguishable the complementary dualistic concept taoism represents the reciprocal interaction throughout related feedback loop where opposing forces not exchange opposition but instead exchange reciprocally promote stabilization similar homeostasis underlying principle taoism states that within every independent entity lies part its within sickness lies health and vice this because all opposites are manifestations the single and are therefore not independent from one but rather variation the same unifying force throughout all mind matter and body dualism philosophy mind dualism philosophy philosophy mind dualism any narrow variety views about the relationship between mind and which claims that mind and matter are two ontologically separate mind body dualism claims that neither the mind nor matter can reduced each other any and thus opposed materialism and reductive materialism mind body dualism can exist substance dualism which claims that the mind and the body are composed distinct and property dualism which claims that there may not distinction but that mental and physical properties are still categorically and not reducible each this type dualism sometimes referred mind and body and stands contrast philosophical monism which views mind and matter being ultimately the same kind see also cartesian dualism substance dualism epiphenomenalism buddhist philosophy during the classical era buddhist philosophy india philosophers such dharmakirti argue for dualism between states consciousness and buddhist atoms the basic building blocks that make according the standard buddhist metaphysics typically western philosophy dualism considered dualism between mind and brain which ultimately involves mind interacting with the physical and therefore also interacting with the particles basic building that make the brain buddhist different that not dualism between the mind and but rather between states consciousness and basic building blocks according the buddhist atomism buddhist atoms are also they are unstructured points like many buddhists from dharmakirti philosophy involved mereological nihilism meaning that other than states the only things that exist are momentary quantum much like the particles quantum physics quarks electrons etc citation needed history the first significant argument against dualism came from thomas hobbes materialist critique the human hobbes argues that all human experience comes from biological processes contained within the body the leviathan response the french philosopher ren descartes developed cartesian dualism which posits that there mechanical body and immaterial mind which interact with one the body perceives external inputs and the awareness them comes from the the point interaction between the two the pineal gland the during the and materialistic monism has became the still addition already discussed theories dualism particularly the christian and cartesian there are new theories the defense naturalistic dualism comes from australian david chalmers born who argues there explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot bridged reductionism because consciousness logically autonomous the physical properties upon which according naturalistic account property dualism requires new fundamental category properties described new laws supervenience the challenge being analogous that understanding electricity based the mechanistic and newtonian models materialism prior maxwell equations similar defense comes from australian philosopher frank jackson born who revived the theory epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states not play role physical jackson argues that there are two kinds the first substance dualism that assumes there non corporeal form this body and soul are two different the second form property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties the same claims that functions the soul are very private experiences that are not accessible observation and therefore not accessible science least not can know for about facility for but will never know how the bat experiences that mind imagines girl who grows white she may grow learning all about the scientific facts but has way experiencing colors other than black when someone brings red tomato into her she she discovers new the experience red like that experience not physical fact but conscious soul dualism soul dualism some people also other are believed have two kinds soul several one these souls associated with body functions and sometimes thought disappear after but not and the other one able leave the body for shaman free soul may held able undertake spirit the plethora soul types may even more the bipartite view theology recognizes the existence both material and immaterial aspects human typically body and this distinct from the tripartite view that holds soul and spirit separate aspects person along with the theistic dualism dualism can refer the relationship between god and creation god and the this form dualism belief shared certain traditions christianity and christianity the dualism between god and creation has existed central belief multiple historical sects and traditions including catharism paulicianism and gnostic christianity christian dualism refers the belief that god and creation are but interrelated through indivisible sects like the cathars and the this dualism between the material created evil and moral historians divide christian dualism into absolute which held that the good and evil gods were equally and mitigated which held that material evil was subordinate the spiritual the christian theologians who adhere libertarian compatibilist view free that free will separates humankind from god has also been characterized form the theologian leroy stephens rouner compares the dualism christianity with the dualism that exists zoroastrianism and the vedanta tradition the theological use the word dualism dates back book that describes the dualism between good and the tolerance dualism ranges widely among the different christian monotheistic the conflict between dualism and monism has existed christianity since its the catholic encyclopedia describes the catholic the dualistic hypothesis eternal world existing side side with god was course the thirteenth but body dualism was the problem evil difficult reconcile with absolute and has prompted some christian sects veer towards gnostic forms christianity were more and some gnostic traditions posited that the devil was separate from god independent the christian dualists the byzantine the paulicians were seen manichean heretics byzantine this tradition christian founded constantine silvanus argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from moral the cathars christian sect southern believed that there was dualism between two one representing good and the other representing the roman catholic church denounced the cathars and sought crush the movement the the albigensian crusade was initiated pope innocent iii remove the cathars from languedoc where they were known the inquisition which began under pope gregory also targeted the hinduism dvaita vedanta dualistic conclusions the vedas school indian philosophy espouses dualism between god and the universe theorizing the existence two separate realities the first and the more important reality that vishnu brahman vishnu the supreme self god the absolute truth the the independent the second reality that dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate everything that composed the second such individual soul jiva matter etc exist with their own separate the distinguishing factor this philosophy opposed advaita vedanta monistic conclusion that god takes personal role and seen real eternal entity that governs and controls the because the existence individuals grounded the they are depicted images even shadows the but never any way identical with the salvation therefore described the realization that all finite reality essentially dependent the consciousness matter dualism while western philosophical traditions exemplified equate mind with the conscious self and theorize consciousness the basis body some eastern philosophies provide alternate intimately related substance dualism drawing metaphysical line between consciousness and matter where matter includes both body and samkhya and yogic philosophy samkhya and yoga schools indian philosophy there are two innate and independent realities consciousness itself purusha primordial

processes and mental events are conscious only the extent they receive illumination from consciousness compared light which illuminates the material configurations assumed the intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear ahamkara the ego the phenomenal appropriates all mental experiences itself
