concerned with whether correct hold such hence normative ethics sometimes called rather than however certain versions the ethical view called moral realism moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive the same traditionally normative ethics also known moral was the study what makes actions right and these theories offered overarching moral principle one could appeal resolving difficult moral the turn the moral theories became more complex and are longer concerned solely with rightness and but are interested many different kinds moral during the middle the the study normative ethics declined ethics grew this focus ethics was part caused intense linguistic focus analytic philosophy and the popularity logical positivism john rawls published theory justice noteworthy its pursuit moral arguments and eschewing this publication set the trend for renewed interest normative virtue ethics virtue ethics virtue ethics describes the character moral agent driving force for ethical and used describe the ethics socrates aristotle and other early greek socrates was one the first greek philosophers encourage both scholars and the common citizen turn their attention from the outside world the condition this knowledge bearing human life was placed while all other knowledge were self knowledge was considered necessary for success and inherently essential aware person will act completely within his capabilities his while ignorant person will flounder and encounter person must become aware every fact and its relevant his wishes attain posited that people will naturally what they know what evil bad actions are the result criminal was truly aware the intellectual and spiritual consequences his would neither commit nor even consider committing those any person who knows what truly right will automatically according while correlated knowledge with virtue similarly equated virtue with joy the truly wise man will know what what and therefore aristotle posited ethical system that may termed when person acts accordance with his nature and realizes his full will good and baby not but potential become real person the inherent potential must unhappiness and frustration are caused the unrealized potential leading failed goals and poor aristotle nature does nothing therefore imperative for people act accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents order content and happiness was held the ultimate all other such civic life wealth are merely means the self the awareness nature and the development the surest path aristotle asserted that man had three vegetable animal and rational physical nature can assuaged through exercise and emotional nature through indulgence instinct and and mental through human reason and developed rational development was considered the most essential philosophical awareness and uniquely moderation was with the extremes seen degraded and for courage the moderate virtue between the extremes cowardice and recklessness man should not simply but live well with conduct governed moderate this regarded virtue denotes doing the right the right the right the proper the correct for the right stoicism the stoic philosopher epictetus posited that the greatest good was contentment and peace apatheia was the highest self mastery over desires and emotions leads spiritual the unconquerable central this the will should independent and allowing person disturb the mental equilibrium essence offering yourself person free anger you you have control over your internal and therefore freedom from material attachments also thing the person should not but realize was thing that could similarly someone should those close them should hold their serenity because the loved one was made flesh and blood destined stoic philosophy says accept things that cannot resigning oneself existence and enduring rational death not people not lose their but instead return for they are returning god who initially gave what the person epictetus said difficult problems life should not but rather they are spiritual exercises needed for the health the just physical exercise required for the health the also stated that sex and sexual desire are avoided the greatest threat the integrity and equilibrium abstinence highly epictetus said remaining abstinent the face temptation was victory for which man could hedonism hedonism hedonism posits that the principal ethic maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain there are several schools hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence even momentary desires those teaching pursuit spiritual their consideration they range from those advocating self gratification regardless the pain and expense those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most cyrenaic hedonism founded aristippus cyrenaics supported immediate gratification drink and for tomorrow even fleeting desires should for fear the opportunity should forever there was little concern with the the present dominating the pursuit for immediate cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit enjoyment and indulgence without believing pleasure the only epicureanism epicureanism epicurean ethics hedonist form virtue epicurus presented sustained argument that correctly will coincide with rejected the extremism the cyrenaics believing some pleasures and indulgences detrimental human epicureans observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted negative some experiences were therefore rejected out and some unpleasant experiences endured the present ensure better life the epicurus the summum bonum greatest was exercised through moderation and excessive indulgence can destructive pleasure and can even lead for eating one food too often will cause person lose taste for eating too much food once will lead discomfort and pain and fear were living was essentially barring pain and death was not fear was considered the source most conquering the fear death would naturally lead happier epicurus reasoned there was afterlife and the fear death was there was life after then the person would not alive fear would existent irrational fret over circumstances that not such state death the absence state consequentialism state consequentialism state consequentialism also known mohist ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth action based how much contributes the basic goods the stanford encyclopedia philosophy describes mohist dating back the century remarkably sophisticated version based plurality intrinsic goods taken constitutive human

filial kind and the mohists believed that morality based promoting the benefit all under heaven and eliminating harm all under contrast state consequentialism not utilitarian because not hedonistic the importance outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance individual pleasure and consequentialism consequentialism ethical egoism consequentialism refers moral theories that hold that the consequences particular action form the basis for any valid moral judgment about that action create structure for see rule consequentialism thus from consequentialist morally right action one that produces good this view often expressed the aphorism the ends justify the the term consequentialism was coined anscombe her essay modern moral philosophy describe what she saw the central error certain moral such those propounded mill and sidgwick since the term has become common language ethical the defining feature consequentialist moral theories the weight given the consequences evaluating the rightness and wrongness consequentialist the consequences action rule generally outweigh other apart from this basic there little else that can unequivocally said about consequentialism however there are some questions that many consequentialist theories what sort consequences count good who the primary beneficiary moral how are the consequences judged and who judges one way divide various consequentialisms the types consequences that are taken matter that which consequences count good states according utilitarianism good action one that results increase positive and the best action one that results that effect for the greatest closely related eudaimonic consequentialism according which flourishing which may may not the same enjoying great deal the ultimate similarly one might adopt aesthetic which the ultimate aim produce however one might fix psychological goods the relevant thus one might pursue increase material equality political liberty instead something like the more ephemeral pleasure other theories adopt package several all promoted whether particular consequentialist theory focuses single good conflicts and tensions between different good states affairs are expected and must utilitarianism utilitarianism utilitarianism ethical theory that argues the proper course action one that maximizes positive such happiness welfare the ability live according personal jeremy bentham and john stuart mill are influential proponents this school fragment government bentham says the greatest happiness the greatest number that the measure right and and describes this fundamental axiom introduction the principles morals and legislation talks the principle but later prefers the greatest happiness utilitarianism the paradigmatic example consequentialist moral this form utilitarianism holds that what matters the aggregate positive effect everyone and not only any one john stuart mill his exposition proposed hierarchy meaning that the pursuit certain kinds pleasure more highly valued than the pursuit other another noteworthy proponent utilitarianism the philosopher sam harris author the moral landscape there are two types act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism act utilitarianism the principle utility applied directly each alternative act situation the right act then defined the one which brings about the best results the least amount bad rule utilitarianism the principle utility used determine the validity rules conduct moral rule like keeping established looking the consequences world which people broke promises will and world which promises were right and wrong are then defined following breaking those deontology deontological ethics deontological ethics deontology from greek deon duty and logia approach ethics that determines goodness rightness from examining acts the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove this contrast consequentialism which rightness based the consequences and not the act act may considered right even the act produces bad follows the rule that one should unto others they would have done unto and even the person who does the act lacks virtue and had bad intention doing the citation needed according have duty act way that does those things that are inherently good acts for follow objectively obligatory rule rule utilitarianism for the ends consequences our actions are not important and and our intentions are not important and immanuel theory ethics considered deontological for several different first kant argues that act the morally right people must act from duty deon second kant argued that was not the consequences actions that make them right wrong but the motives the person who carries out the immanuel kant argument that act the morally right one must act from begins with argument that the highest good must both good and good without something good when intrinsically good and good without when the addition that thing never makes situation ethically kant then argues that those things that are usually thought such intelligence perseverance and pleasure fail either intrinsically good good without pleasure for appears not good without because when people take pleasure watching someone this seems make the situation ethically concludes that there only one thing that truly nothing the indeed nothing even beyond the can possibly conceived which could called good without qualification except good will contemporary virtue ethics virtue ethics modern virtue ethics was popularized during the late century large part

universal that those who wish utilitarian consequentialist ground their theories religious alasdair macintyre who wrote the book after virtue was key contributor and proponent modern virtue although
