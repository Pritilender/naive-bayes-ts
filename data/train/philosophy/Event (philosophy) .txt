july philosophy events are objects time instantiations properties however universal definition has not been multiple theories exist concerning contents kim exemplification account events davidson theories events lewis theory events badiou theory events see also external links exemplification account events jaegwon kim theorized that events are they are composed three object property and time temporal interval events are defined using the operation unique event defined two the existence condition states exists and only object exemplifies the adic time this means unique event exists the above the identity condition states and only and kim uses these define events under five one they are unchangeable particulars that include changes and the states and conditions that two they have semi temporal location three only their constructive property creates distinct four holding constructive property generic event creates token relationship between and events are not limited their three requirements critics this theory such myles brand have suggested that the theory modified that event had spatiotemporal region consider the event flash the idea that event must include both the span time the flash lightning and the area which other problems exist within never specified what properties were universals tropes natural etc not specified properties are few the following response the basic generic events may best picked out relative scientific whether the theory sense theory the behavior sized objects highly sophisticated physical they are among the important relative the terms which lawful regularities can described and the basic parameters terms which the laws the theory are formulated this give our basic generic and the usual mathematical and perhaps other types operations them would yield defined generic commonly recognize such properties colors temperatures weights pushing and generic events and but must view this against the background our sense explanatory and predictive scheme the world around think highly likely that cannot pick out generic events completely priori there also major debate about the essentiality constitutive there are two major questions involved one event could have occurred the same manner were another and could occur the same manner would have occurred different kim holds that neither are true and that different conditions different person would lead separate however some consider natural assume the davidson theories events donald davidson and john lemmon proposed theory events that had two major respectively causal criterion and spatiotemporal the causal criterion defines event two events being the same and only they have the same cause and effect the spatiotemporal criterion defines event two events being the same and only they occur the same space the same time davidson however provided this metal ball becomes warmer during certain and during the same minute rotates through degrees must say that these are the same however one can argue that the warming the ball and the rotation are possibly temporally separated and are therefore separate lewis theory events david lewis theorized that events are merely spatiotemporal regions and properties membership class defines event event only class spatiotemporal both thisworldly assuming occurs the actual and the only problem with this definition only tells what event could but does not define unique this theory entails modal realism which assumes possible worlds exist worlds are defined sets containing all objects that exist part that however this theory some philosophers have attempted remove possible and reduce them other entities they hold that the world exist the only world that actually and that possible worlds are only lewis theory composed four key firstly the duplication states that and are separate events and only there one member that not member vice secondly there exist regions that are subsets possible worlds and events are not structured essential badiou theory events being and event alain badiou writes that the event multiple which basically does not make sense according the rules the other words hence the event and order for there there must intervention which changes the rules the situation order allow that particular event meaning multiple which belongs the multiple the these terms are drawn from defined reference set theory his there and everything that one happens when the situation accounts acknowledges defines counts for the event counted one the counted the one the intervention needs decide its belonging the this because his definition the event violates the prohibition against belonging other theoretical definition which violates set rules thus does not count extant its see also random
