aesthetics epistemology ethics logic metaphysics political philosophy branches aesthetics epistemology ethics logic metaphysics political philosophy social philosophy lists index outline years problems publications theories glossary philosophers philosophy portal existence has been variously defined common the world one aware conscious through senses and that persists independent other definitions describe everything that more everything some define everything that most people believe aristotle relates the concept causality ontology the philosophical study the nature being existence reality well the basic categories being and their traditionally listed part the major branch philosophy known metaphysics ontology deals with questions concerning what entities exist can said exist for does udfj exist and how such entities can related within hierarchy and subdivided according similarities and lively debate continues about the existence god epistemology studies criteria truth defining primary inherently accepted the investigation the first inherent every its self evident priori nature cannot consistently since person objecting existence according some standard proof must implicitly accept the existence materialism holds that the only thing that exists matter that all things are composed and all phenomena including consciousness are the result material life characteristic that distinguishes objects that have sustaining biological processes from those that not either because such functions have ceased death else because they lack such functions and are classified inanimate contents etymology historical conceptions early modern philosophy predicative nature semantics modern approaches existence the wide and narrow senses european views anti realist arguments dharmic middle view see also notes references external links etymology the word existence comes from the latin word exsistere meaning but means stand being the latin prefix for out added the causative the verb stare meaning historical conceptions avicennism scholasticism the western tradition the earliest known comprehensive treatments the subject are from plato phaedo republic and statesman and aristotle metaphysics though earlier fragmentary writing aristotle developed comprehensive theory according which only individual called fully have but other things such quantity time and place called the categories have derivative kind dependent individual metaphysics there are four causes existence change the material the formal the efficient and the final the neo platonists and some early christian philosophers argued about whether existence had any reality except the mind some taught that existence was snare and that the the and the devil existed only tempt weak humankind away from the medieval philosopher thomas aquinas argued that god pure and that god essence and existence are the about the same the nominalist philosopher william ockham argued book his summa totius logicae treatise all logic written some time before that categories are not form being their own but derivative the existence early modern philosophy the early modern treatment the subject derives from antoine arnauld and pierre nicole logic the art thinking better known the port royal logic first published arnauld thought that proposition judgment consists taking two different ideas and either putting them together rejecting after conceiving things our compare these ideas finding that some belong together and others unite separate this called affirming and general this judgment also called and easy see that must have two one which one affirms denies called the subject the other which affirmed called the attribute praedicatum the art thinking royal logic the two terms are joined the verb the predicate denied the thus every proposition has three the two and the copula that connects separates even when the proposition has only two the three terms are still for example god loves really means god lover god means god this theory judgment dominated logic for but has some obvious only considers proposition the form all are form logicians call universal does not allow propositions the form some are form logicians call existential neither nor includes the idea then some are simply adjoins conversely include the idea existence the way that triangle contains the idea three angles equal two right then automatically and have ontological proof indeed contemporary descartes famously argued regarding the concept god discourse meditation arnauld theory was current until the middle the nineteenth david hume argued that the claim that thing when added our notion does not add anything the for form complete notion and superadd that notion the claim that moses are not adding anything the notion kant also argued that existence not real predicate but gave explanation how this indeed his famous discussion the subject merely restatement doctrine that the proposition god the verb signifies the joining separating two concepts such god and omnipotence original schopenhauer claimed that everything that exists for and hence the whole this only object relation the perception the representation according him there can object without because everything objective already conditioned such manifold ways the knowing subject with the forms its and presupposes these predicative nature john stuart mill and also pupil herbart argued that the predicative nature existence was proved sentences like centaur poetic greatest number franz brentano challenged also better did frege brentano argued that can join the concept represented noun phrase the concept represented adjective give the concept represented the noun phrase for can join wise give wise but the noun phrase wise not whereas some man hence the copula must more than merely join separate furthermore adding exists wise give the complete sentence wise man has the same effect joining some wise using the the copula has the same effect exists brentano argued that every categorical proposition can translated into existential one without change meaning and that the exists and does not the existential proposition take the place the showed this the following frege developed similar view though his great work the foundations arithmetic did charles sanders peirce but peirce held that the possible and the real are not limited the individually existent the brentano view the basis the dominant position modern american philosophy that existence asserted the existential quantifier expressed quine slogan the value what there semantics mathematical logic there are two some and all though brentano pointed can make with just one quantifier and the first these some also expressed there thus the sentence there exists the term man asserted part but can also there exists triangle abstract idea part existence the same way that man physical body part abstractions such blindness and virtue exist the same sense that tables and houses what categories kinds can the subject the predicate worse does existence exist some existence implied without being the statement bridge crosses the thames cannot just about the and must about existence the other the statement bridge crosses the styx has the same but while the first case understand real bridge the real world made stone what existence would mean the second case less the nominalist approach argue that certain noun phrases can eliminated rewriting sentence form that has the same but does not contain the noun thus ockham argued that socrates has which apparently asserts the existence reference for wisdom can rewritten socrates which contains only the referring phrase socrates this method became widely accepted the twentieth century the analytic school however this argument may inverted realists arguing that since the sentence socrates can rewritten socrates has this proves the existence hidden referent for wise further problem that human beings seem process information about fictional characters much the same way that they process information about real for the united states presidential politician and actor named fred thompson ran for the republican party nomination potential voters identified fred thompson law and candidate thompson plays fictional character the television series law and order doubtless the people who make the comment are aware that law and order but some they process fiction were dubious discuss citation needed another example this the common experience actresses who play the villain soap opera being accosted public they are blame for the actions the characters they scientist might make clear distinction about objects that and assert that all objects that exist are made either matter but the worldview existence includes fictional and even contradictory thus reason from the statement pegasus flies the statement pegasus are not asserting that pegasus made but rather that pegasus exists particular the worldview classical when mathematician reasons from the statement abc the statement triangles she not asserting that triangles are made atoms but rather that triangles exist within particular mathematical model modern approaches according bertrand russell theory descriptions the negation operator singular sentence can take either wide narrow distinguish between some not where negation takes narrow and not the case that some where negation takes wide the problem with this view that there appears such scope distinction the case proper the sentences socrates not and not the case that socrates both appear have the same and they both appear assert presuppose the existence someone who not that negation takes narrow however russell theory analyses proper names into logical structure which makes sense this according russell socrates can analysed into the form the philosopher the wide scope this would then not the case that there existed philosopher greece who was the narrow scope would read the philosopher greece was not according the direct reference view early version which was originally proposed bertrand russell and perhaps earlier gottlob frege proper name strictly has meaning when there object which this view relies the argument that the semantic function proper name tell which object bears the and thus identify some but object can identified none thus proper name must have bearer existence the wide and narrow senses according the two view which derives from alexius meinong existential statements fall into two those asserting existence wide sense these are typically the form for singular some those asserting existence narrow sense these are typically the form the problem then evaded pegasus implies existence the wide for implies that something flies but does not imply existence the narrow for deny existence this sense saying that pegasus does not the world all things this into those like socrates the planet venus and new york that have existence the narrow and those like sherlock holmes the goddess venus and minas tirith that however common sense suggests the existence such things fictional characters european views influenced the views pupil alexius meinong and edmund husserl germanophone and francophone philosophy took different direction regarding the question anti realist arguments anti realism the view idealists who are skeptics about the physical maintaining that nothing exists outside the mind that would have access independent reality even may realists hold that perceptions sense data are caused independent who denies that other minds exist solipsist different from who claims that there fact the matter whether not there are unobservable other minds logical behaviorist dharmic middle view the indian philosopher nagarjuna largely advanced existence concepts and founded the madhyamaka school mah buddhism eastern anicca sanskrit anitya impermanence describes refers the fact that all conditioned things sankhara are constant state reality there thing that ultimately ceases only the appearance thing ceases changes from one form imagine leaf that falls the ground and while the appearance and relative existence the leaf the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes form new buddhism teaches middle avoiding the extreme views eternalism and nihilism the middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived exist and the way things really the differences are reconciled the concept shunyata addressing the existing served purpose for the identity what exists because the subject trailokya elaborates three kinds those form and formlessness which there are karmic taken further the trikaya doctrine describes how the buddha this accepted that the buddha exists more than one absolute see also being cogito ergo sum conservation law cosmogony cosmological argument existence precedes essence existence theorem existentialism
