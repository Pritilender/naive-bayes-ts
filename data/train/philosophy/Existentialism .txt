despite profound doctrinal shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human not merely the thinking but the feeling living human individual the starting point characterized what has been called the existential sense disorientation and confusion the face apparently meaningless absurd world many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic academic both style and too abstract and remote from concrete human ren kierkegaard generally considered have been the first existentialist though did not use the term proposed that each not society solely responsible for giving meaning life and living passionately and sincerely authentically existentialism became popular the years following world war and strongly influenced many disciplines besides including drama art

definitional issues and background there has never been general agreement the definition the term often seen historical convenience was first applied many philosophers long after they had while existentialism generally considered have originated with the first prominent existentialist philosopher adopt the term description was jean paul sartre sartre purports the idea that which all existentialists have common the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes scholar frederick copleston explains according philosopher steven crowell defining existentialism has been relatively and argues that better understood general approach used reject certain systematic philosophies rather than systematic philosophy sartre lecture delivered described existentialism the attempt draw all the consequences from position consistent although many outside scandinavia consider the term existentialism have originated from kierkegaard more likely that kierkegaard adopted this term least the term existential description his from the norwegian poet and literary critic johan sebastian cammermeyer welhaven this assertion comes from two the norwegian philosopher erik lundestad refers the danish philosopher fredrik christian sibbern sibbern supposed have had two conversations the first with welhaven and the second with the first conversation that believed that welhaven came with word that said covered certain which had close and positive attitude relationship described this was then brought kierkegaard the second claim comes from the norwegian historian rune slagstad who claims prove that kierkegaard himself said the term existential was borrowed from the strongly believes that was kierkegaard himself who said that hegelians not study philosophy use phrase welhaven from one time when spoke with him about the other the norwegian historian anne lise seip critical and believes the statement fact stems from the norwegian literary historian cathrinus bang there also exists the belief that meaninglessness and absurdity create behavior pattern that not consistent with that which considered normal other existentialism jars you out your like sexual and the the individual consciousness paramount the societal impact one may have and your reality that dictates your not anybody citation needed concepts existence precedes essence existence precedes essence central proposition existentialism that existence precedes essence which means that the most important consideration for individuals that they are independently acting and conscious beings existence rather than what roles stereotypes definitions other preconceived categories the individuals fit essence the actual life the individuals what constitutes what could called their true instead there being arbitrarily attributed essence others use define thus human through their own consciousness create their own values and determine meaning their although was sartre who explicitly coined the similar notions can found the thought existentialist philosophers such heidegger and kierkegaard the subjective thinker form the form his his style his form must just manifold are the opposites that holds the systematic eins zwei drei abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever applied the the same degree the subjective thinker the same degree his form must also concretely but just himself not not not also his form none these his form must first and last related and this regard must have his disposal the the the the subordinate setting etc which belong the well balanced character the esthetic are themselves the subjective thinker has only one and has nothing with localities and such the setting not the fairyland the where poetry produces nor the setting laid and historical accuracy not the setting inwardness existing human the concretion the relation the categories one historical accuracy and historical actuality are ren kierkegaard concluding hong often claimed this context that people define which often perceived stating that they can wish for and then according most existentialist however this would constitute inauthentic instead the phrase should taken say that people are defined only insofar they act and that they are responsible for their for someone who acts cruelly towards other people that defined cruel furthermore this action such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity cruel this opposed their human nature bearing the sartre writes his work existentialism humanism man first all encounters surges the and defines himself the more therapeutic aspect this also person can choose act different and good person instead cruel here also clear that since humans can choose either cruel they neither these things the absurd absurdism the notion the absurd contains the idea that there meaning the world beyond what meaning give this meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality unfairness the this contrasts with the notion that bad things happen good the metaphorically there such thing good person bad what happens and may just well happen good person bad person because the any point anything can happen and tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the the notion the absurd has been prominent literature throughout many the literary works ren samuel beckett franz kafka fyodor dostoyevsky eug ionesco jean paul and albert camus contain descriptions people who encounter the absurdity the relation the concept the devastating awareness meaninglessness that albert camus claimed that there only one truly serious philosophical and that his the myth sisyphus although prescriptions against the possibly deleterious consequences these kinds encounters from religious stage insistence persevering spite the concern with helping people avoid living their lives ways that put them the perpetual danger having everything meaningful break down common most existentialist the possibility having everything meaningful break down poses threat quietism which inherently against the existentialist has been said that the possibility suicide makes all humans facticity facticity facticity concept defined sartre being and nothingness the itself which humans are the mode not this can more easily understood when considering relation the temporal dimension one past what one the sense that constitutes however say that one only past would ignore significant part reality the present and the while saying that past only what one would entirely detach from oneself denial own concrete past constitutes inauthentic and the same goes for all other kinds facticity having one that allow person run faster than the speed values etc facticity both limitation and condition limitation that large part facticity consists things one have chosen etc but condition the sense that values most likely depend however even though facticity set being for cannot determine the value ascribed facticity still ascribed freely that consider two one whom has memory his past and the other remembers they have both committed many but the first knowing nothing about leads rather normal life while the second feeling trapped his own continues life blaming his own past for trapping him this there nothing essential about his committing but ascribes this meaning his however disregard facticity the continual process one projects oneself into the would put oneself denial and would thus other the origin projection must still though the mode not being another aspect facticity that entails angst both the sense that freedom produces angst when limited and the sense that the lack the possibility having facticity step for one take responsibility for something one has done also produces what not implied this account existential however that values are consideration values may cause one reconsider and change consequence this fact that one responsible for not only but also the values one this entails that reference common values excuse the even though these are the values the society which the individual they are also their own the sense that they could choose them different any thus the focus freedom existentialism related the limits the responsibility one bears result the relationship between freedom and responsibility one and clarification freedom also clarifies that for which one authenticity authenticity many noted existentialist writers consider the theme authentic existence authentic existence involves the idea that one has create and then live accordance with this what meant authenticity that one should act not one acts any other essence the authentic act one that accordance with condition freedom this includes but not the degree that this facticity can any way determine choices the sense that one could then blame background for making the choice one the role facticity relation authenticity involves letting actual values come into play when one makes choice instead like choosing randomly that one also takes responsibility for the act instead choosing without allowing the options have different contrast the inauthentic the denial live accordance with this can take many from pretending choices are meaningless through convincing oneself that some form determinism sort mimicry where one acts one how one should act often determined image one has how one such oneself bank lion prostitute etc acts this image usually corresponds some sort social but this does not mean that all acting accordance with social norms the main point the attitude one takes own freedom and and the extent which one acts accordance with this the other and the look other the other when written with capital concept more properly belonging phenomenology and its account intersubjectivity however the concept has seen widespread use existentialist and the conclusions drawn from differ slightly from the phenomenological the experience the other the experience another free subject who inhabits the same world person its most basic this experience the other that constitutes intersubjectivity and when one experiences someone and this other person experiences the world the same world that person only from over the world itself constituted objective that something that there identical for both the person experiences the other person experiencing the same this experience the look what termed the look sometimes the gaze while this its basic phenomenological constitutes the world and oneself objectively existing subjectivity one experiences oneself seen the look precisely the same way that one experiences the other seen also acts kind limitation this because the look tends objectify what when one experiences oneself the one experience oneself nothing but sartre own example man peeping someone through keyhole can help clarify this man entirely caught the situation reflexive state where his entire consciousness directed what goes the suddenly hears creaking floorboard behind and becomes aware himself seen the thus filled with shame for perceives himself would perceive someone else doing what was peeping the look then constitutive another characteristic feature the look that other really needs have been quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement old the look some kind mystical telepathic experience the actual way the other sees one there may also have been someone but could have not noticed that the person was only perception the way another might perceive angst angst living educational theory existential angst sometimes called anxiety anguish term that common many existentialist generally held negative feeling arising from the experience human freedom and the archetypal example the experience one has when standing cliff where one not only fears falling off but also dreads the possibility throwing oneself this experience that nothing holding one senses the lack anything that predetermines one either throw oneself off stand and one experiences own can also seen relation the previous point how angst before and this what sets apart from fear that has while the case one can take definitive measures remove the object the case such constructive measures are the use the word nothing this context relates both the inherent insecurity about the consequences and the fact experiencing freedom one also realizes that one fully responsible for these there nothing people for that acts their that they can blame something goes therefore not every choice perceived having dreadful possible consequences can human lives would unbearable every choice facilitated however this change the fact that freedom remains condition every angst often described drama adolescent troubles with during their developmental this adolescent trouble loathing often tied sexual both males and females often feel this angst and worry that they will not find both partner romantic conditional love for who they adolescents face the prospect adulthood where they must take control their life the dread both facing life alone and the fear freedom and responsibility often lead despair despair existential crisis generally defined loss more loss hope reaction breakdown one more the defining qualities self person invested being particular such bus driver upstanding and then finds his thing would normally found state despair hopeless for singer who loses the ability sing may despair she has nothing else fall back nothing rely for her she finds herself unable what defined her what sets the existentialist notion despair apart from the conventional definition that existentialist despair state one even when overtly long identity depends qualities that can perpetual and there sartrean human essence found conventional reality which constitute the sense despair universal human kierkegaard defines either let each one learn what both can learn that unhappiness never lies his lack control over external since this would only make him completely works love when the forsaken worldliness earthly life shuts itself the confined air develops the moment gets stuck and stands the prospect need felt for enlivening breeze cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest suffocate lovingly hope all things the opposite despairingly hope nothing love hopes all things yet never put relate oneself expectantly the possibility the good relate oneself expectantly the possibility evil the decision choose hope one decides infinitely more than because eternal opposition positivism and rationalism positivism rationalism existentialists oppose definitions human beings primarily and therefore oppose positivism and rationalism existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based subjective meaning rather than pure the rejection reason the source meaning common theme existentialist the focus the feelings anxiety and dread that feel the face our own radical freedom and our awareness kierkegaard advocated rationality means interact with the objective world the natural but when comes existential reason human reason has like sartre saw problems with calling form bad attempt the self impose structure world phenomena the that fundamentally irrational and according rationality and other forms bad faith hinder people from finding meaning try suppress their feelings anxiety and people confine themselves within everyday sartre thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing being possessed one form another the the possessed

recognize that existing subject studying the words more recollection this contrast looking collection truths that are outside and unrelated the but may develop who lectures earnest things distance from everyday life the learner who should put existentialism and nihilism existential nihilism although nihilism and existentialism are distinct they are often confused with one primary cause confusion that friedrich nietzsche important philosopher both but also the existentialist insistence the inherent meaninglessness the existentialist philosophers often stress the importance angst signifying the absolute lack any objective ground for move that often reduced moral existential nihilism pervasive theme the works existentialist however persist through encounters with the seen camus the myth sisyphus one must imagine sisyphus and only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality created kierkegaard regained sort morality the religious although himself agree that was the religious suspends the and sartre final words being and nothingness are all these which refer pure and not accessory reflection can find their reply only the ethical shall devote them future etymology the term existentialism was coined the french catholic philosopher gabriel marcel the when marcel applied the term him colloquium jean paul sartre rejected but changed his mind october publicly adopted the existentialist label lecture the club maintenant the lecture was published existentialisme est humanisme existentialism humanism short book that did much popularize existentialist some scholars argue that the term should used only refer the cultural movement europe the and associated with the works the philosophers jean paul sartre simone beauvoir maurice ponty and albert camus other scholars extend the term and yet others extend far back socrates however the term often identified with the philosophical views paul history century kierkegaard and nietzsche ren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche ren kierkegaard friedrich nietzsche ren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche were two the first philosophers considered fundamental the existentialist though neither used the term existentialism and unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism the they focused subjective human experience rather than the objective truths mathematics and which they believed were too detached observational truly get the human like pascal they were interested quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness life and the use diversion escape from unlike kierkegaard and nietzsche also considered the role making free particularly regarding fundamental values and and how such choices change the nature and identity the kierkegaard knight faith and bermensch are representative people who exhibit freedom that they define the nature their own nietzsche idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel kierkegaard opposed the level abstraction and not nearly hostile actually christianity argues through pseudonym that the objective certainty religious truths specifically not only but even founded logical yet continues imply that leap faith possible means for individual reach higher stage existence that transcends and contains both aesthetic and ethical value kierkegaard and nietzsche were also precursors other intellectual including postmodernism and various strands psychology however kierkegaard believed that individuals should live accordance with their dostoyevsky fyodor dostoyevsky the first important literary author also

crisis saint manuel the martyr which has been collected anthologies existentialist another spanish ortega gasset writing held that human existence must always defined the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances his soy circunstancia myself and sartre likewise believed that human existence not abstract but always also many thought his plays were absurd although martin buber

coining the term existentialism introduced important existentialist themes french audience his early essay existence and and his metaphysical journal dramatist well marcel found his philosophical starting point condition metaphysical the human individual searching for harmony transient harmony for was sought through secondary dialogical rather than dialectical approach the characterized wonder and and open the presence other people and god rather than merely information about for such presence implied more than simply being there one thing might the presence another connoted extravagant availability and the willingness put oneself the disposal the marcel contrasted secondary reflection with scientific technical primary reflection which associated with the activity the abstract cartesian ego for philosophy was concrete activity undertaken feeling human being incarnate embodied concrete although jean paul sartre adopted the term existentialism for his own philosophy the marcel thought has been described almost diametrically that unlike marcel was and became catholic convert the psychologist and philosopher karl jaspers who later described existentialism phantom
