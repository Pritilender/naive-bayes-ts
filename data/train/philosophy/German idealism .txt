speculative philosophical movement that emerged germany the late and early was reaction against immanuel kant critique pure reason and was closely linked with both romanticism and the revolutionary politics the enlightenment the most notable thinkers the movement were johann gottlieb fichte friedrich schelling and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel while friedrich heinrich jacobi gottlob ernst

the word idealism has more than one the philosophical meaning idealism here that the properties discover objects depend the way that those objects appear perceiving and not something they possess apart from our experience the very notion thing itself should understood option set functions for operating such that consider something that appears without respect the specific manner which the question what properties thing might have independently the thus incoherent for citation needed clarification needed background kant work purported bridge the two dominant philosophical schools the rationalism which held that knowledge could attained reason alone priori prior and empiricism which held that knowledge could arrived only through the senses posteriori after kant solution was propose that while can via sensory particular facts about the world which termed phenomena cannot know the form they must take prior any experience which called noumena that cannot know what objects will but can know how will encounter kant called his mode philosophising critical philosophy that was supposedly less concerned with setting out positive doctrine than with critiquing the limits the theories can set the conclusion called transcendental idealism this distinguished from classical idealism and subjective idealism such george berkeley which held that external objects have actual being real existence only when they are perceived kant said that there are noumena that things that exist other than being merely sensations and ideas our kant held the critique pure reason that the world appearances empirically real and transcendentally the mind plays central role influencing the way that the world perceive phenomena through time space and the categories the understanding this notion that was taken heart philosophical the other end the arthur schopenhauer not normally classed german idealist citation needed considered himself transcendental idealist his major work the world will and representation discusses his indebtedness and the work includes extensive analysis the critique the young hegelians number philosophers who developed work various were some cases the other karl marx who was numbered among had professed himself materialist kant transcendental idealism consisted taking point view outside and above oneself and understanding that the mind directly knows only phenomena whatever exists other than mental ideas that appear the itself and cannot directly and immediately kant had criticized pure wanted restrict judging and speaking only objects possible the main german who had been theology reacted against stringent theorists jacobi leap faith friedrich heinrich jacobi addressed his book idealism and realism kant concept jacobi agreed that the objective itself cannot directly however must taken subject must believe that there real object the external world that related the representation mental idea that directly this faith belief result revelation immediately but logically truth the real existence itself revealed disclosed the observing this the subject directly knows the subjective representations that appear the and strongly believes the objective itself that exists outside the presenting the external world object jacobi legitimized belief and its theological reducing the external world matter wanted merely open little door for faith reinhold karl leonhard reinhold published two volumes letters concerning the kantian philosophy and they provided clear explication which were previously inaccessible due use complex technical reinhold also tried prove assertion that humans and other animals can know only images that appear their never things that are not mere appearances order establish his reinhold stated axiom that could not possibly from this all knowledge consciousness could his axiom representation distinguished consciousness the subject from the subject and and referred thereby not from but from principle that referred mental images representations conscious this analyzed knowledge into the knowing the known and the image representation the order understand transcendental necessary reflect deeply enough distinguish experience consisting these three subject subject representation and schulze kant noted that mental idea representation must representation and deduced that something external the gave the name ding sich thing itself that which however gottlob ernst schulze wrote anonymously that the law cause and effect only applies the phenomena within the not between those phenomena and any themselves outside the that itself cannot the cause idea image thing the this discredited philosophy using own reasoning disprove the existence fichte johann gottlieb fichte after schulze had seriously criticized the notion johann gottlieb fichte produced philosophy similar but without fichte asserted that our ideas mental images are merely the productions our knowing for there external itself that produces the the the knowing the cause the external object fichte style was challenging exaggeration already difficult also fichte claimed that his truths were apparent non intuition that the truth can immediately seen the use schopenhauer student wrote fichte because the itself had just been once prepared system without any consequently rejected the assumption anything that was not through and through merely our representation and therefore let the knowing subject all all any rate produce everything from its own for this once did away with the essential and most meritorious part the kantian the distinction between priori and posteriori and thus that between the phenomenon and the for declared everything priori naturally without any proofs for such monstrous instead gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask profundity and the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising moreover appealed boldly and openly intellectual that really inspiration parerga and paralipomena schelling friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling schelling attempted rescue theism from refutation the proofs for now the philosophy schelling from the first admitted the possibility knowledge although likewise started from the philosophy which denies such with regard the experience friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling claimed that the needs the because there subject without and vice the ideas mental images the mind are identical the extended objects which are external the according absolute indifferentism there difference between the subjective and the that the ideal and the arthur schopenhauer criticized absolute identity the subjective and the the ideal and the verything that rare minds like locke and kant had separated after incredible amount reflection and was again poured into the pap that absolute for the teaching those two thinkers locke and may very appropriately described the doctrine the absolute diversity the ideal and the the subjective and the objective schleiermacher friedrich schleiermacher was theologian who asserted that the ideal and the real are united understood the ideal the subjective mental activities intellect and the real for the objective area nature and physical schleiermacher declared that the unity the ideal and the real manifested the two divisions not have productive causal effect each rather they are both equally existent the absolute transcendental entity which maimon salomon maimon influenced german idealism criticizing claiming that kant did not explain how opposites such sensibility and understanding could relate each maimon claimed that the dualism between these faculties was analogous the old cartesian dualism between the mind and and that all the problems the older dualism should hold mutatis mutandis for the new such was the heterogeneity between understanding and maimon further that there could criterion determine how the concepts the understanding apply the intuitions thus pointing out these problematic maimon and the humean critics left foothold open for skepticism within the framework own for now the question arose how two such heterogeneous realms the intellectual and the sensible could known correspond with one the problem was longer how know that our representations correspond with things themselves but how know that priori concepts apply posteriori intuitions schelling and however tried solve this problem claiming that opposites are absolutely citation needed maimon concept infinite mind the basis all opposites was similar the german idealistic attempt rescue theism positing absolute mind maimon metaphysical concept infinite was similar ich and ignored the results criticism and returned kantian transcendent what characterizes schelling and speculative idealism contrast critical idealism the recurrence metaphysical ideas from the rationalist what kant forbade violation the limits human fichte schelling and hegel saw necessity the critical philosophy now maimon was the crucial figure behind this reviving metaphysical ideas from within the problematic the critical gave them new legitimacy and opened the possibility for critical resurrection maimon said have influenced writing here seems striking similarity between discussion spinoza the lebensgeschichte and discussion spinoza the lectures the history philosophy hegel georg wilhelm friedrich hegel georg wilhelm friedrich hegel was german philosopher born stuttgart rttemberg day southwest hegel responded philosophy suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given kant his antinomies pure reason applied not only the four areas kant gave world infinite finite material composite atomic etc but all objects and notions and know this suggested makes vital part philosophical given that abstract thought thus went consider how historical formations give rise different philosophies and ways for thought fails when only given abstraction and not united with considerations historical his major work the phenomenology spirit went trace the formation consciousness through history and the importance other people the awakening consciousness see master slave dialectic thus hegel introduces two important ideas metaphysics and the integral importance history and the other person his work theological that replaces the traditional concept god with that absolute spirit spinoza who changed the anthropomorphic concept god into that vague underlying was praised hegel whose concept absolute fulfilled similar hegel claimed that you are either spinozist not philosopher although read context clear that this not intended praise but complaint about the philosophy the because the chapter from which the quote taken hegel highly critical reality results from according objects that appear spectator originate mind responses neo kantianism neo kantianism kantianism refers broadly revived type philosophy along the lines that laid down immanuel kant the more specifically criticism the kantian philosophy his work the world will and representation well other kantian philosophers such jakob friedrich fries and johann friedrich has some more specific reference later german hegelianism hegelianism right hegelians young hegelians karl marx hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth its according bertrand russell the leading academic both america and were largely his influence has continued contemporary philosophy but mainly continental philosophy schopenhauer arthur schopenhauer arthur schopenhauer contended that spinoza had great influence kantian german schopenhauer consequence criticism all speculative theology almost all the philosophizers germany cast themselves back that the whole series unsuccessful attempts known the name kantian philosophy simply spinozism tastelessly got veiled all kinds unintelligible language and otherwise twisted and according kant original with its refutation all speculative theology had been transformed the german through the use his technical such and they attempted speak what exists beyond experience this revive the notions free and immortality kant had effectively relegated these ineffable notions faith and british idealism british idealism thomas hill green bradley bernard bosanquet mctaggart harold joachim john henry muirhead geoffrey reginald gilchrist mure during the

according jos ortega gasset with kantian german never before has lack truthfulness played such large and important role they did whatever they felt like doing with magic they changed anything into any other according ortega the basic force behind their work was not strictly and exclusively the desire for ortega gasset quoted schopenhauer parerga and paralipomena volume which schopenhauer wrote that schelling and hegel forgot the fact that one can feel authentic and bitter for schopenhauer ortega hoped that philosophers like those three men could learn true and fruitful such that the problem
