evolution from prakriti causes the creation constituents including intellect buddhi ego ahamkara and mind manas samkhya theorises the existence are many living souls jeevatmas who possess but denies the existence ishvara samkhya holds that the eternal pure due identifies itself with products prakriti such intellect and ego this results endless transmigration and however once the realisation arises that distinct from the self longer subject transmigration and absolute freedom kaivalya arises western dualism deals with the distinction between the mind and the whereas samkhya between the soul and the concept the atma different from the concept the mind and mind itself thought evolute rather than the soul absolute reality that eternal indivisible attributeless pure matter and beyond originally samkhya was not but confluence with yoga developed theistic yoga indian philosophy yoga the name one the six orthodox philosophical the yoga philosophical system closely allied with the samkhya school the yoga school expounded patanjali accepts the samkhya psychology and but more theistic than the evidenced the addition divine entity the five elements the parallels between yoga and samkhya were close that max ller says that the two philosophies were popular parlance distinguished from each other samkhya with and samkhya without the intimate relationship between samkhya and yoga

kaivalya the foundational text the yoga school the yoga sutras patanjali who regarded the founder the formal yoga the sutras the yoga philosophy are ascribed who may have max ller the author representative the philosophy without being necessarily the author the hindu philosophy distinguishes seven major branches yoga also referred classical system yoga codified pata jali and classified one the six stika orthodox schools hindu jnana yoga also called buddhi yoga centred the faculty discernment and virtually identical with the spiritual path karma which the world everyday work becomes the tool which self bhakti yoga the path devoted service tantra yoga focused the techniques and physical teachings contained within body texts called tantras mantra one the most ancient forms yoga which the acoustical properties the spoken word are used concentrate the hatha yoga system physical purification designed reintegrate and balance the mind and body preparation for yoga first described yogi nyaya the nyaya school based the nyaya sutras they were written aksapada probably the sixth century the most important contribution made this school its this methodology based system logic that has subsequently been adopted the majority the indian this comparable the relationship between western science and which was derived largely from aristotelian nevertheless nyaya was seen its followers more than logical its own they believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way gain release from and they took great pains identify valid sources knowledge and distinguish these from mere false according there are exactly four sources perception inference comparison and knowledge obtained through each these either valid nyaya developed several criteria this nyaya probably the closest indian equivalent analytic the later naiyanikas gave logical proofs for the existence and uniqueness ishvara response which that was fundamentally important later development nyaya was the system navya vaisheshika the vaisheshika school postulates atomic pluralism which all objects the physical universe are reducible certain types and brahman regarded the fundamental force that causes consciousness these the school was founded the sage kana bhuk literally atom eater around the century major ideas contained the vaisheshika sutra are there are nine classes four classes atoms water light and space akasha time direction infinity souls atman mind manas individual souls are eternal and pervade material body for there are seven categories pad rtha experience substance quality activity generality particularity inherence and although the vaisheshika school developed independently from the the two eventually merged because their closely related metaphysical its classical however the vaisheshika school differed from the nyaya one crucial where nyaya accepted four sources valid the vaisheshika accepted only perception and purva mimamsa the main objective the purva mimamsa school was establish the authority the consequently this most valuable contribution hinduism was its formulation the rules vedic its adherents propounded unquestionable faith the vedas and regular performance the yaj they believed the power the mantras and sustain all the activity the keeping with this they placed great emphasis dharma which consisted the performance vedic the mimamsa philosophers accepted the logical and philosophical teachings the other but felt they did not sufficiently emphasise attention right they believed that the other schools thought that aimed for release moksha were not allowed for complete freedom from desire and because the very striving for liberation stemmed from simple desire according mimamsa only acting accordance with the prescriptions the vedas may one attain the mimamsa school later shifted its views and began teach the doctrines brahman and its adherents then advocated the release escape the soul from its constraints through enlightened although mimamsa does not receive much scholarly its influence can felt the life the practising because all hindu ceremony and law influenced this vedanta the vedanta later mimamsa concentrates the philosophical teachings the upanishads rather than the ritualistic injunctions the brahmanas etymologically vedanta the last segment knowledge the also known the while the earlier segments the vedas are called karma parts vedas that focus spiritual practices such devotion and meditation are called upasana while the traditional vedic rituals continued practised meditative and propitiatory more centered understanding began these were mystical aspects vedic religion that focused self and spiritual more than traditional the more abstruse vedanta the essence the encapsulated the vedantic thought drew vedic hymns and the brihadaranyaka upanishad believed have appeared far back years while thirteen upanishads are accepted over hundred the most significant contribution vedantic thought the idea that consciousness continuous with and indistinguishable from consciousness the aphorisms the vedanta sutras are presented poetic which allows for variety consequently the vedanta separated into six each interpreting the texts its own way and producing its own series advaita advaita vedanta advaita literally means this the oldest and most widely acknowledged vedantic its first great consolidator was adi shankaracharya who continued the line thought the upanishadic and that his teacher gaudapada wrote extensive commentaries the major vedantic scriptures and was successful the revival and reformation hindu thinking and way according this school brahman the only and there exists nothing whatsoever which not brahman the appearance dualities and differences this world superimposition brahman called maya maya the illusionary and creative aspect brahman which causes the world maya neither existent nor but appears exist case any illusion for example when person tries know brahman through his due the influence maya brahman appears god ishvara separate from the world and from the there difference between the individual soul jivatman and brahman the spiritual practices such devotion god meditation self less action etc purifies the mind and indirectly helps perceiving the one whose vision obscured ignorance does not see the dual nature the blind not see the resplendent hence the only direct cause liberation knowledge which directly removes the after one sees own self and the universe the non dual brahman existence vishishtadvaita vishishtadvaita ramanujacharya was the foremost proponent the philosophy vishishtadvaita qualified vishishtadvaita advocated the concept supreme being with essential qualities vishishtadvaitins argued against the advaitin conception brahman impersonal empty they saw brahman eternal but also the source all which was omnipresent and actively involved them the sense object perception was illusory and sign however the sense self was not complete illusion since was derived from the universal beingness that ramanuja saw vishnu personification dvaita dvaita vedanta dualistic conclusions the vedas school philosophy was founded madhvacharya espouses dualism theorising the existence two separate realities the first and the more important reality that vishnu vishnu the supreme self god the absolute truth the the independent the second reality that dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate everything that composed the second such individual soul jiva matter etc exist with their own separate the distinguishing factor this philosophy opposed advaita vedanta monistic conclusion that god takes personal role and seen real eternal entity that governs and controls the five further distinctions are vishnu distinct from vishnu distinct from souls are distinct from soul distinct from another and matter distinct from other souls are eternal and are dependent upon the will this theology attempts address the problem evil with the idea that souls are not because the existence individuals grounded the they are depicted images even shadows the but never any way identical with the salvation therefore described the realisation that all finite reality essentially dependent the dvaitadvaita dvaitadvaita was proposed nimbarka century vaishnava philosopher from the andhra according this philosophy there are three categories brahman soul and soul and matter are different from brahman that they have attributes and capacities different from brahman exists while soul and matter are thus soul and matter have existence that separate yet further brahman the soul the and matter the thing also the highest object worship krishna and his consort attended thousands gopis the celestial and devotion consists shuddhadvaita shuddhadvaita the purely philosophy propounded vallabhacharya the founding philosopher was also the guru the samprad tradition the path hindu vaishnava tradition focused the worship krishna acintya bheda abheda achintya bheda abheda chaitanya mahaprabhu stated that the soul energy god both distinct and distinct from whom identified krishna govinda and that although may experienced through process loving devotion bhakti followed the dvaita concept sri this philosophy inconceivable oneness and shaivism early history shaivism difficult however the vatara upanishad bce considered the earliest textual exposition systematic philosophy shaivism represented various philosophical including dualist abheda dualist bheda and dualist bhed bheda perspectives vidyaranya his works mentions three major schools shaiva pashupata shaivism shaiva siddhanta and kashmir shaivism pashupata shaivism pashupata shaivism the oldest the major shaivite schools the philosophy pashupata sect was systematized lakulish the century pashu pashupati refers the effect created the word designates that which dependent something whereas pati means the cause the word designates the who the cause the the the pashupatas disapproved the vaishnava theology known for its doctrine servitude souls the supreme the grounds that dependence upon anything could not the means cessation pain and other desired they recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not emancipated because they still depend upon something other than according soul possesses the attributes the supreme deity when becomes liberated from the germ every pashupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the the insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent the sentient the insentient was further divided into effects and the effects were ten the four elements and their colour the causes were thirteen the five organs the five organs the three internal intellect the ego principle and the cognising these insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification self with salvation pashupata shaivism involved the union the soul with god through the shaiva siddhanta considered normative tantric shaivism shaiva siddhanta provides the normative cosmology and theological categories tantric being dualistic the goal shaiva siddhanta become ontologically distinct shiva through this tradition later merged with the tamil saiva movement and expression concepts shaiva siddhanta can seen the bhakti poetry the nayanars kashmir shaivism kashmir shaivism arose during the eighth ninth century kashmir and made significant both philosophical and until the end the twelfth century categorised various scholars monistic idealism absolute idealism theistic realistic transcendental physicalism concrete monism school aivism consisting trika and its philosophical articulation even both kashmir shaivism and advaita vedanta are dual philosophies which give primacy universal consciousness chit brahman kashmir opposed all things are manifestation this this implies that from the point view kashmir the phenomenal world akti and exists and has its being consciousness chit whereas advaita holds that brahman inactive kriya and the phenomenal world illusion the objective human according kashmir merge shiva universal realize
