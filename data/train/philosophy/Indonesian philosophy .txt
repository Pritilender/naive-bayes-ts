sumardjo therefore the necessary task this school philosophy seek recall and revitalize the ethnic original since the values are lokalitas ialah ibu manusia and people are existence balita ialah bapak manusia sumardjo the following are some philosophical notions which this school adat for this school adat plays very important adat the main inspiration for ethnic the intellectual legacy which belongs particular ethnic adat inherited from forefathers later generations the ethnic indonesians believe that adat not human but the spirits and supernatural powers ruling the this adat very different from what englishmen call tradition custom convention today its meaning not simply but more particularly goes far includes everything englishmen call law nowadays and goes much further than law determining the needs and the actions individuals and the ordains the ceremonies birth and the times and the methods for sowing building praying for and many other economics politics philosophy and art all come within its indeed from one point adat simply social expression the community much not human and its exercise men are still constantly watched over the spirits and supernatural powers ruling because the adat which regulates the entire life the community dominated spirits and supernatural that communal life inevitably static and deeply its roots lay the obscurity the when the ancestors laid down the adat once and for minangkabau people crack with the heat rot the such environment the word has special denoting something sacred powerful and full wisdom alisjahbana myths origin among intellectual legacy which the adat inherited indonesians set myths origin the myths are sung and only recently important ceremonies held special occasions death marriage harvest festival and the benuaq tribe east kalimantan for has set myths known temputn this temputn tells myths origin world and human and animal plants water fire rain death ancestor and some social taboos michael hopes karaakng according temputn far before humankind had been they were two families who inhabited the the raw materials used the sky create the earth and the finally the first human came into was married who was his own and had many some whom later became seniangs group spirits who live the responsible for the policing the most important moral affairs and they are charge adat guardians the seniangs can inflict punishments the their children were not only the human race and but also animals like wildcats the bears ancestor the pigs the forefathers ancestor snakes and many others michael hopes karaakng pantun pantun original kind poem created line poem that consists two the first two lines are called sampiran and the second two lines isi the sampiran always provides analogy for the isi and symbolizes macrocosm for microcosm the mythology went humankind was made materials from which the sky created the sky and the and pantun reflects this belief very the sampiran represents the sky and the while the isi signifies the both between sampiran and isi there must logical correspondence they both are symbols harmony the nature and humankind sumardjo below example pantun tujuh hari dalam hutan air tak nasi tak makan sehari tiada pandang tuan rasanya susut tubuh badan the sampiran which says seven days deep forest drinking eating rice must have logical correspondence with the isi which says meeting you sir day feels like the body becomes thinner and thinner the sampiran says about the suffering one can feel when deep forest seven days without drink and while the isi says about the suffering one can feel when does not meet day the lover really longs yearns the sampiran therefore analogizes the isi the suffering the pepatah pepatah like proverb saying these sayings are part the adat the sense that they give guidance and instruction every member particular ethnic group treat others well the believed that pepatah were created ancestors inspired supernatural powers and spirits nasroen the wording pepatah taken from which means that all guidance for life must derived from the laws nature nature has its own laws and obligation submit the myth origin told humans were parts they were made they had live total submission its laws nasroen here are some examples pepatah dalam laut dapat dalam hati siapa tahu can assume the depth the but cannot assume what teaches very clearly about the danger assuming what for this knowledge can only obtained asking the people not ada ada semut where there there teaches the law causality which effect can inferred there malu sesat jalan you are shy asking you will get lost your teaches the importance asking questions the process seeking after knowledge and the adat social structure has been stated above that not only did adat include custom convention and but also included kind social the social structure bound common adat was typified scale communities people villages nomads wandering over specific these communities were rather like miniature democratic republics their headmen were elected from the descendants the oldest branch the and they saw the needs and interests the assisted council really important decisions were taken collective called mupakat naturally democracy this which premium put unanimity the position the balai was extremely this was the building which meetings and discussions were can think them the centers social life within these small communities alisjahbana the principal duty the village government was administer the adat handed down from generation and settle any disputes that might
