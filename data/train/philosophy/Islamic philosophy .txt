there indication that the limited knowledge and experience humans can lead also important observe while reason aql sometimes recognised source islamic this may have totally different meaning from reason philosophy islamic philosophy generic term that can defined and used different its broadest sense means the world view derived from the islamic texts concerning the creation the universe and the will the another sense refers any the schools thought that flourished under the islamic empire the shadow the islamic culture and islamic its narrowest sense translation falsafa meaning those particular schools thought that most reflect the influence greek systems philosophy such neoplatonism and aristotelianism the historiography islamic philosophy marked disputes how the subject should properly some the key issues involve the comparative importance eastern intellectuals such ibn sina and western thinkers such ibn and also whether islamic philosophy can read face value should interpreted esoteric fashion supporters the latter like leo strauss maintain that islamic philosophers wrote conceal their true meaning order avoid religious persecution but scholars such oliver leaman disagree formative influences islamic philosophy the name implies refers philosophical activity within the islamic the main sources classical early islamic philosophy are the religion islam itself especially ideas derived and interpreted from the quran and greek philosophy which the early muslims inherited result along with islamic indian philosophy and persian philosophy many the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and the latter exemplified greek early islamic philosophy early islamic philosophy socrates early islamic which refers philosophy during the islamic golden age traditionally dated between the and two main currents may the first kalam which mainly dealt with islamic theological questions and the other falsafa which was founded interpretations aristotelianism and neoplatonism there were attempts later theologians harmonizing both notably ibn sina who founded the school avicennism ibn rushd who founded the school averroism and others such ibn haytham and rayh kalam kalam ilm arabic the philosophy that seeks islamic theological principles through dialectic arabic the word literally means speech one first debates was that between partisans the qadar meaning have who affirmed free will and the jabarites meaning force constraint who believed fatalism the century the hijra new movement arose the theological school basra iraq wasil ibn ata was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary then sunni tradition and became leader new systematized the radical opinions preceding particularly those the qadarites and this new school was called tazilite from tazala separate the compelled defend their principles against the sunni islam their looked for support philosophy and represent early attempt pursue rational theology later offshoot this known ash arism aimed reconcile critical dialectical thinking with stricter islamic the tazilite and arite schools are collectively called mutakallimun and their type theology was known ilm kalam scholastic theology later kalam was used mean simply theology the duties the heart opposed conjunction fikh the duties the body falsafa falsafa greek loanword meaning philosophy the greek pronunciation philosophia became falsafa from the century due caliph mun and his ancient greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs and the peripatetic school began find able among them were kindi farabi ibn sina and ibn rushd all whose fundamental principles were considered criticized the mutakallamin another represented the brethren purity used aristotelian language expound fundamentally neoplatonic and neopythagorean world during the abbasid caliphate number thinkers and some them heterodox muslims played role transmitting hindu and other islamic knowledge the christian west they contributed making aristotle known christian europe three speculative farabi ibn sina and kindi combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through some differences between kalam and falsafa aristotle attempted demonstrate the unity but from the view which that matter was followed that god could not the creator the however demonstrate through causal the existence first cause from which stemmed all changeable undermining the traditional views aristotle divine can fact creating according the human soul simply substantial form the set properties that make matter into living human this seems imply that the human soul cannot exist apart from the indeed aristotle clear that the least some parts cannot separated from the and those have the right idea who think that the soul does not exist without the least one psychological the active intellect can exist apart from the however according many the active intellect superhuman entity emanating from god and enlightening the human not part any individual human thus aristotle theories seem deny the immortality the individual human wherefore the mutakallimun had before anything establish system philosophy demonstrate the creation that they adopted the theory atoms enunciated democritus they taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor originally atoms were created and are created now occasion seems bodies come into existence through the aggregation the sunderance these but this theory did not remove the objections philosophy creation for indeed supposed that god commenced his work certain definite time his and for certain definite must admitted that was imperfect before accomplishing his before attaining his order obviate this the motekallamin extended their theory the atoms time and claimed that just space constituted atoms and time likewise constituted small indivisible the creation the world once was easy matter for them demonstrate the existence and that god omnipotent and omniscient end the classical period the kalam attacked both the philosophers and the perished for lack the same however falsafa came under serious critical the most devastating attack came from ghazali whose work tahafut falasifa the incoherence the philosophers effectively demolished the main arguments the peripatetic ibn rushd ibn averro maimonides contemporary was one the last the islamic peripatetics and set out defend the views the falsafa against the theories ibn rushd not differ fundamentally from those ibn bajjah and ibn tufail who only follow the teachings ibn sina and farabi like all islamic ibn rushd admits the hypothesis the intelligence the spheres and the hypothesis universal through which motion communicated from place place all parts the universe far the supreme hypotheses the mind the arabic did away with the dualism involved doctrine pure energy and eternal but while farabi ibn sina and other persian and muslim philosophers over subjects that trenched traditional ibn rushd delighted dwelling upon them with full particularity and thus not only matter but form potentially inherent otherwise were creation nihilo according this therefore the existence this world not only ibn sina declared but also logic logic islamic philosophy early islamic logic played important islamic law placed importance formulating standards which gave rise novel approach logic kalam but this approach was later displaced ideas from greek philosophy and hellenistic philosophy with the rise the tazili philosophers who highly valued aristotle organon the works influenced islamic philosophers were crucial the reception aristotelian logic medieval along with the commentaries the organon averroes the works farabi avicenna ghazali and other muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms also played central role the subsequent development european logic during the renaissance according the routledge encyclopedia philosophy for the islamic logic included not only the study formal patterns inference and their validity but also elements the philosophy language and even epistemology and metaphysics because territorial disputes with the arabic islamic philosophers were very interested working out the relationship between logic and and they devoted much discussion the question the subject matter and aims logic relation reasoning and the area formal logical they elaborated upon the theory terms propositions and syllogisms formulated interpretatione and prior the spirit they considered the syllogism the form which all rational argumentation could and they regarded syllogistic theory the focal point even poetics was considered syllogistic art some fashion most the major islamic important developments made muslim logicians included the development avicennian replacement aristotelian avicenna system logic was responsible for the introduction hypothetical syllogism temporal modal logic and inductive logic other important developments early islamic philosophy include the development strict science citation the isnad backing and the development scientific method open inquiry disprove the ijtihad which could generally applied many types logic islamic law and theology early forms analogical reasoning inductive reasoning and categorical syllogism were introduced fiqh islamic sharia islamic and kalam islamic from the century with the process qiyas before the arabic translations later during the islamic golden age there was debate among islamic logicians and theologians over whether the term qiyas refers analogical inductive reasoning categorical some islamic scholars argued that qiyas refers inductive ibn hazm disagreed arguing that qiyas does not refer inductive reasoning but categorical syllogistic reasoning real sense and analogical reasoning metaphorical sense the other ghazali and modern abu muhammad asem maqdisi argued that qiyas refers analogical reasoning real sense and categorical syllogism metaphorical other islamic scholars the however argued that the term qiyas refers both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism real aristotelian logic the first original arabic writings logic were produced kindi who produced summary earlier logic his the first writings logic with aristotelian elements was produced farabi who discussed the topics future contingents the number and relation the categories the relation between logic and grammar and aristotelian forms inference also credited for categorizing logic into two separate the first being idea and the second being proof averroes author the most elaborate commentaries aristotelian was the last major logician from andalus avicennian logic avicenna developed his own system logic known avicennian alternative aristotelian the avicennian logic had replaced aristotelian logic the dominant system logic the islamic the first criticisms aristotelian logic were written avicenna who produced independent treatises logic rather than criticized the logical school baghdad for their devotion aristotle the investigated the theory definition and classification and the quantification the predicates categorical propositions and developed original theory temporal modal syllogism its premises included modifiers such all most and some while avicenna often relied deductive reasoning used different approach ibn sina contributed inventively the development inductive logic which used pioneer the idea syndrome his medical avicenna was the first describe the methods difference and concomitant variation which are critical inductive logic and the scientific method ibn hazm wrote the scope logic which stressed the importance sense perception source ghazali had important influence the use logic making use avicennian logic kalam despite the logical sophistication ghazali the rise the ash ari school the from the century slowly suffocated original work logic much the islamic though logic continued studied some islamic regions such persia and the levant fakhr din razi criticised first figure and developed form inductive logic foreshadowing the system inductive logic developed john stuart mill systematic refutations greek logic were written the illuminationist school founded shahab din suhrawardi who developed the idea decisive necessity important innovation the history logical philosophical another systematic refutation greek logic was written ibn taymiyyah the radd ala mantiqiyyin refutation greek logicians where argued against the though not the the syllogism and favour inductive reasoning metaphysics islamic metaphysics cosmological and ontological arguments avicenna proof for the existence god was the first ontological argument which proposed the metaphysics section the book healing this was the first attempt using the method priori proof which utilizes intuition and reason avicenna proof existence unique that can classified both cosmological argument and ontological ontological insofar necessary intellect the first basis for arguing for necessary the proof also cosmological insofar most taken with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end necessary distinction between essence and existence islamic imbued with islamic theology distinguishes more clearly than aristotelianism the difference between essence and existence whereas existence the domain the contingent and the essence endures within being beyond the this was first described avicenna works metaphysics who was himself influenced farabi some orientalists those particularly influenced thomist scholarship argued that avicenna was the first view existence wujud accident that happens the essence mahiyya however this aspect ontology not the most central the distinction that avicenna established between essence and one cannot therefore make the claim that avicenna was the proponent the concept essentialism per given that existence wujud when thought terms necessity would ontologically translate into notion the wajib wujud dhatihi which without description definition without quiddity essence mahiyya lahu consequently avicenna ontology existentialist when accounting for qua existence terms necessity wujub while essentialist terms thinking about qua existence terms qua imkan mumkin wujud meaning contingent some argue that avicenna anticipated frege and bertrand russell holding that existence accident and also anticipated alexius meinong view about nonexistent also provided early arguments for necessary being cause all other existents the idea essence existence concept which dates back avicenna and his school well shahab din suhrawardi and his illuminationist philosophy existence essence the opposite notion was developed the works averroes and mulla sadra transcendent theosophy resurrection adem adam noah ibr abraham ism ishmael isaac moses mar mary jesus abdul muttalib muhammad dotted lines indicate multiple generations ibn nafis wrote the theologus autodidactus defense the system islam and the doctrines the missions the religious the resurrection the and the transitoriness the the book presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality the human using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus forms evidence later islamic scholars viewed this work response avicenna metaphysical argument spiritual resurrection opposed bodily which was earlier criticized ghazali the mention all the prophets from adam muhammad quraan indicates islamic philosophy from the days whereas may not known that time the name soul and spirit the muslim physician avicenna and ibn nafis developed their own theories the they both made distinction between the soul and the spirit and the avicennian doctrine the nature the soul was influential among the scholastics some views the soul included the idea that the immortality the soul consequence its and not purpose for his theory the ten viewed the human soul the tenth and final intellect avicenna generally supported aristotle idea the soul originating from the heart whereas ibn nafis the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul related the entirety and not one few organs further criticized idea that every unique soul requires the existence unique this case the ibn nafis concluded that the soul related primarily neither the spirit nor any but rather the entire matter whose temperament prepared receive that and defined the soul nothing other than what human indicates saying thought experiments avicennism thought experiments consciousness while was imprisoned the castle fardajan near hamadhan avicenna wrote his famous floating thought experiment demonstrate human self awareness and the substantiality the referred the living human intelligence particularly the active intellect which believed the hypostasis which god communicates truth the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility nature his floating thought experiment tells its readers imagine themselves suspended the isolated from all sensations which includes sensory contact with even their own argues this one would still have self consciousness thus concludes that the idea the self not logically dependent any physical thing and that the soul should not seen relative terms but primary substance this argument was later refined and simplified ren descartes epistemic terms when can abstract from the supposition all external but not from the supposition own time contrast ancient greek philosophers who believed that the universe had infinite past with medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept the universe having finite past with this view was inspired the creation myth shared the three abrahamic religions judaism christianity and islam the christian philosopher john philoponus presented the first such argument against the ancient greek notion infinite however the most sophisticated medieval arguments against infinite past were developed the islamic kindi the jewish philosopher saadia gaon saadia ben and the islamic theologian ghazali they developed two logical arguments against infinite the first being the argument from the impossibility the existence actual which the second the argument from the impossibility completing actual infinite successive states both arguments were adopted later christian philosophers and and the second argument particular became more famous after was adopted immanuel kant his thesis the first antimony concerning truth metaphysics avicenna ibn defined truth what corresponds the mind what outside avicenna elaborated his definition truth his metaphysics the truth thing the property the being each thing which has been established his quodlibeta thomas aquinas wrote commentary definition truth his metaphysics and explained the truth each avicenna says his metaphysica nothing else than the property its being which has been established that called true gold which has properly the being gold and attains the established determinations the nature now each thing has properly being some nature because stands under the complete form proper that whereby being and species that nature early islamic political philosophy emphasized inexorable link between science and religion and emphsized the process ijtihad find ibn haytham reasoned that discover the truth about necessary eliminate human opinion and and allow the universe speak for his aporias against ptolemy ibn haytham further wrote the following comments truth sought for itself the are immersed uncertainties and the scientific authorities such whom greatly are not immune from the seeker after the truth not one who studies the writings the ancients following his natural puts his trust but rather the one who suspects his faith them and questions what gathers from the one who submits argument and and not the sayings human being whose nature fraught with all kinds imperfection and thus the duty the man who investigates the writings learning the truth his make himself enemy all that and applying his mind the core and margins its attack from every should also suspect himself performs his critical examination that may avoid falling into either prejudice constantly sought knowledge and and became belief that for gaining access the effulgence and closeness there better way than that searching for truth and natural philosophy physics medieval islam atomism alchemy and chemistry medieval islam atomistic philosophies are found very early islamic and represent synthesis the greek and indian like both the greek and indian islamic atomism was charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious yet was such fertile and flexible idea greece and flourished some schools islamic the most successful form islamic atomism was the asharite school most notably the work the philosopher ghazali asharite atomism atoms are the only material things and all else the world accidental meaning something that lasts for only nothing accidental can the cause anything except exists for contingent events are not subject natural physical but are the direct result constant without which nothing could thus nature completely dependent which meshes with other asharite islamic ideas causation the lack other traditions islam rejected the atomism the asharites and expounded many greek especially those active school philosophers including the noted commentator averroes explicitly rejected the thought ghazali and turned extensive evaluation the thought averroes commented detail most the works aristotle and his commentaries did much guide the interpretation aristotle later jewish and christian scholastic cosmology astronomy medieval islam there are several cosmological verses the qur which some modern writers have interpreted foreshadowing the expansion the universe and possibly even the big bang theory don those who reject faith see that the heavens and the earth were single entity then ripped them and the heavens did create with our and cause quran contrast ancient greek

heliocentric view the universe expressed section god has placed the sun the center the universe just the capital country placed its middle and the palace the center the evolution struggle for existence the tazili scientist and philosopher jahiz was the first the muslim biologists and philosophers develop early theory evolution speculated the influence the environment considered the effects the environment the likelihood animal and first described the struggle for existence precursor natural selection ideas the struggle for existence the book animals have been summarized animals engage struggle for for resources avoid being eaten and breed environmental factors influence organisms develop new characteristics ensure thus transforming into new animals that survive breed can pass their successful characteristics chapter india entitled vasudeva and the wars the abu rayhan biruni attempted give naturalistic explanation why the struggles described the mahabharata had take explains using natural processes that include biological ideas related which has led several scholars compare his ideas darwinism and natural selection this due biruni describing the idea artificial selection and then applying the agriculturist selects his letting grow much and tearing out the the forester leaves those branches which perceives whilst cuts away all the bees kill those their kind who only

that result which they are intended produce the economy removes them make room for the nasir din tusi explains how the elements evolved into minerals then plants then animals and then humans tusi then goes explain how hereditary variability was important factor for biological evolution living things the organisms that can gain the new features faster are more they gain advantages over other the

courage and appropriate tools some these organs are real for horns teeth and knife and feet and the thorns and needles some animals are similar animals that have other means defense the gazelle and protect themselves with the help flight and some for bees ants and some bird have united communities order protect themselves and help each tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced such humans probably anthropoid apes live the western sudan and other distant corners the they are close animals their deeds and the human has features that distinguish him from other but has other features that unite him with the animal vegetable kingdom even with the inanimate transmutation species dinawari considered the founder arabic botany for his book plants discussed plant evolution from its birth its describing the phases plant growth and the production flowers and ibn miskawayh fawz asghar and the brethren purity encyclopedia the brethren purity the epistles ikhwan safa developed theories evolution that possibly had influence charles darwin and his inception darwinism but has one time been criticized these state that god first created matter and invested with energy for matter therefore adopted the form vapour which assumed the shape water due the next stage development was mineral life different kinds stones developed course their highest form being mirjan coral stone which has branches like those after mineral life evolves vegetation the evolution vegetation culminates with tree which bears the qualities this the date palm has male and female does not wither all its branches are chopped but dies when the head cut the palm therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among then born the lowest evolves into ape this not the statement this what ibn maskawayh states and this precisely what written the epistles ikhwan safa the muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into lower kind barbarian man then became superior human man becomes saint prophet evolves into higher stage and becomes angel the one higher angels indeed none but everything begins from him and everything returns english translations the encyclopedia the brethren purity were available from while arabic manuscripts the fawz asghar and the epistles ikhwan safa were also available the university cambridge the these works likely had influence century and possibly charles darwin citation needed the ibn khaldun further developed the evolutionary ideas found the encyclopedia the brethren purity the following statements from his work the muqaddimah express evolutionary explained there that the whole existence its simple and composite worlds arranged natural order ascent and that everything constitutes uninterrupted the essences the end each particular stage the worlds are nature prepared transformed into the essence adjacent either above below this the case with the simple material the case with palms and which the last stage their relation snails and which the stage also the case with creatures combining themselves cleverness and their relation the being who has the ability think and the preparedness for that exists either each stage the meant when speak their plants not have the same fineness and power that animals therefore the sages rarely turned animals are the last and final stage the three minerals turn into and plants into but animals cannot turn into anything finer than numerous other islamic scholars and including the polymaths ibn haytham and khazini discussed and developed these translated into these works began appear the west after the renaissance and may have had impact western philosophy and phenomenology book optics the ash ari polymath ibn haytham considered pioneer phenomenology articulated relationship between the physical and observable world and that intuition psychology and mental functions his theories regarding knowledge and perception linking the domains science and led philosophy existence based the direct observation reality from the point much his thought phenomenology was not further developed until the philosophy mind psychology medieval islam the philosophy mind was studied medieval islamic psychological thought which refers the study the nafs literally self psyche arabic the islamic world particularly during the islamic golden age well modern times and related psychology psychiatry and the neurosciences place and space the arab polymath hasan ibn haytham died presented thorough mathematical critique and refutation aristotle conception place topos his risala qawl makan treatise discourse place aristotle physics book delta stated that the place something the dimensional boundary the containing body that rest and contact with what ibn haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place makan the imagined void mutakhayyal between the inner surfaces the containing showed that place was akin space foreshadowing descartes notion place space qua extensio even leibniz analysis situs ibn mathematization place rested several geometric including his study the sphere and other which showed that the sphere kura the largest magnitude with respect other geometric solids that have equal surface for sphere that has equal surface area that cylinder would larger magnitude than the hence the sphere occupies larger place than that occupied the unlike what entailed aristotle definition that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal ibn haytham rejected aristotle philosophical concept place mathematical later the philosopher abd latif baghdadi tried defend the aristotelian conception place treatise radd ala ibn haytham makan refutation ibn place although his effort was admirable from philosophical was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical ibn haytham also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications his book optics his experimental proof the intromission model vision led changes the way the visual perception space was contrary the previous emission theory vision supported euclid and ptolemy tying the visual perception space prior bodily alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness spatial perception therefore the autonomy without tangible notions distance and size for sight can tell next nothing about such philosophy education the medieval islamic world elementary school was known maktab which dates back least the like madrasahs which referred higher education maktab was often attached the ibn sina known avicenna the one his wrote chapter dealing with the maktab entitled the role the teacher the training and upbringing guide teachers working maktab schools wrote that children can learn better taught classes instead individual tuition from private tutors and gave number reasons for why this the citing the value competition and emulation among pupils well the usefulness group discussions and ibn sina described the curriculum maktab school some describing the curricula for two stages education maktab school primary education ibn sina wrote that children should sent maktab school from the age and taught primary education until they reach the age during which wrote that they should taught the qur islamic metaphysics language literature islamic ethics and manual skills which could refer variety practical secondary education ibn sina refers the secondary education stage maktab schooling the period when pupils should begin acquire manual regardless their social writes that children after the age should given choice choose and specialize subjects they have interest whether was manual literature preaching medicine geometry trade and commerce craftsmanship any other subject profession they would interested pursuing for future career wrote that this was transitional stage and that there needs flexibility regarding the age which pupils the emotional development and chosen subjects need taken into philosophy science islamic science scientific method the pioneering development the scientific method the arab ash ari polymath ibn haytham was important contribution the philosophy science the book optics his scientific method was very similar the modern scientific method and consisted the following observation statement problem formulation hypothesis testing hypothesis using experimentation analysis experimental results interpretation data and formulation conclusion publication findings the model the motions ibn haytham also describes early version occam razor where employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical attempts eliminate from his planetary model the cosmological hypotheses that cannot observed from aporias against ptolemy ibn haytham commented the difficulty attaining scientific truth sought for itself the are immersed uncertainties and the scientific authorities such whom greatly are not immune from held that the criticism existing theories which dominated this book holds special place the growth scientific the seeker after the truth not one who studies the writings the ancients following his natural puts his trust but rather the one who suspects his faith them and questions what gathers from the one who submits argument and and not the sayings human being whose nature fraught with all kinds imperfection and thus the duty the man who investigates the writings learning the truth his make himself enemy all that and applying his mind the core and margins its attack from every should also suspect himself performs his critical examination that may avoid falling into either prejudice ibn haytham attributed his experimental scientific method and scientific skepticism his islamic believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only god reasoned that discover the truth about necessary eliminate human opinion and and allow the universe speak for the winding motion ibn haytham further wrote that faith should only apply prophets islam and not any other the following comparison between the islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative from the statements made the noble shaykh clear that believes ptolemy words everything without relying demonstration calling but pure imitation taqlid that how experts the prophetic tradition have faith may the blessing god upon but not the way that mathematicians have faith specialists the demonstrative ibn haytham described his search for truth and knowledge way leading him closer constantly sought knowledge and and became belief that for gaining access the effulgence and closeness there better way than that searching for truth and his contemporary rayh also introduced early scientific method nearly every field inquiry for his treatise mineralogy kitab jamahir book precious stones the most exact experimental while the introduction his study india declares that execute our has not been possible follow the geometric and develops comparative sociology scientific method the was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into mechanics the first conduct elaborate experiments related astronomical phenomena and pioneer experimental psychology unlike his contemporary avicenna scientific method where general and universal questions came first and led experimental biruni developed scientific methods where universals came out experimental and theories are formulated after during his debate with avicenna natural philosophy biruni made the first real distinction between scientist and philosopher referring avicenna philosopher and considering himself mathematical scientific method was similar the modern scientific method many particularly his emphasis repeated biruni was concerned with how conceptualize and prevent both systematic errors and random errors such errors caused the use small instruments and errors made human argued that instruments produce random errors because their imperfections idiosyncratic then multiple observations must analyzed qualitatively and this arrive sense single value for the constant sought whether arithmetic mean reliable estimate experimental medicine avicenna ibn considered the father modern medicine for his introduction experimental medicine and clinical trials the experimental use and testing drugs and precise guide for practical experimentation the process discovering and proving the effectiveness medical substances his medical the canon medicine which was the first book dealing with experimental laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness new drugs medications which still form the basis modern clinical the drug must free from any extraneous accidental must used not disease the drug must tested with two contrary types because sometimes drug cures one disease its essential qualities and another its accidental the quality the drug must correspond the strength the for there are some drugs whose heat less than the coldness certain that they would have effect the time action must that essence and accident are not the effect the drug must seen occur constantly many for this did not was accidental the experimentation must done with the human for testing drug lion horse might not prove anything about its effect peer review the first documented description peer review process found the ethics the physician written ishaq bin ali rahwi raha syria who describes the first medical peer review process his well later arabic medical manuals state that visiting physician must always make duplicate notes condition every when the patient was cured had the notes the physician were examined local medical council other who would review the practising notes decide whether her performance have met the required standards medical their reviews were the practicing physician could face lawsuit from maltreated other fields epistemology avicennism avicennian epistemology and psychology avicenna most influential theory epistemology his theory which developed the concept tabula rasa argued that the human intellect birth rather like tabula pure potentiality that actualized through education and comes and that knowledge attained through empirical familiarity with objects this world from which one abstracts universal which developed through syllogistic method reasoning observations lead prepositional which when compounded lead further abstract the ibn tufail further developed the concept tabula rasa his arabic novel hayy ibn yaqzan which depicted the development the mind feral child from tabula rasa that complete isolation from desert island the latin translation his entitled philosophus autodidactus published edward pococke the younger had influence john locke formulation tabula rasa essay concerning human understanding eschatology islamic eschatology islamic eschatology concerned with the qiyamah end the world last judgement and the final judgement humanity eschatology relates one the six articles faith aqidah like the other abrahamic religions islam teaches the bodily resurrection the the fulfillment divine plan for and the immortality the human soul though jews not necessarily view the soul the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures jannah heaven while the unrighteous are punished jahannam hell significant fraction one the quran deals with these with many hadith elaborating the themes and islamic apocalyptic literature describing the armageddon often known fitna and malahim ghayba the shi ite tradition ibn nafis dealt with islamic eschatology some depth his theologus autodidactus where rationalized the islamic view eschatology using reason and science explain the events that would occur according islamic presented his rational and scientific arguments the form arabic fiction hence his theologus autodidactus may considered the earliest science fiction work legal philosophy fiqh sharia sharia refers the body islamic law the term means way path the legal framework within which public and some private aspects life are regulated for those living legal system based islamic principles fiqh the term for islamic made the rulings islamic component islamic fiqh expounds the methodology which islamic law derived from primary and secondary mainstream islam distinguish fiqh which means understanding details and inferences drawn from sharia that refers principles that lie behind the scholars hope that fiqh and sharia are harmony any given but they cannot philosophical novels the islamic ibn tufail and ibn nafis were pioneers the philosophical novel ibn tufail wrote the first fictional arabic novel hayy ibn yaqdhan philosophus autodidactus response ghazali the incoherence the philosophers and then ibn nafis also wrote fictional novel theologus autodidactus response ibn philosophus autodidactus both these novels had protagonists hayy philosophus autodidactus and kamil theologus autodidactus who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated cave and living seclusion desert both being the earliest examples desert island however while hayy lives alone the desert island for most the story philosophus autodidactus the story kamil extends beyond the desert island setting theologus autodidactus developing into the first example science fiction novel ibn nafis described his book theologus autodidactus defense the system islam and the doctrines the missions the religious the resurrection the and the transitoriness the presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality the human using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus prove his later islamic scholars viewed this work response the metaphysical claim avicenna and ibn tufail that bodily resurrection cannot proven through view that was earlier criticized latin translation philosophus autodidactus was published prepared edward pococke the the first english translation simon ockley was published and german and dutch translations were also published the philosophus autodidactus went have significant influence european literature and became influential seller throughout western europe the and these translations later inspired daniel defoe write robinson crusoe which also featured desert island narrative and was regarded the first novel english philosophus autodidactus also had
