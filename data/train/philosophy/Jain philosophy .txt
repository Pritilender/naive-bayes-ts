insistence that truth relative and multifaceted and for its willingness accommodate all possible points the rival strongly upholds the individualistic nature soul and personal responsibility for and that reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for throughout its the jain philosophy remained unified and although jainism was divided into various sects and the contribution jain philosophy developing some indian philosophies has been jain philosophical concepts like ahimsa karma moksa samsara and like have been assimilated into the philosophies other indian religions like

interacting with each these constituents behave according the natural laws and their nature without interference from external dharma true religion according jainism vatthu dhamm translated the intrinsic nature substance its true karma action goodness karma jainism karma the basic principle within overarching not only encompasses the causality but also conceived extremely subtle which infiltrates the obscuring its transparent and pure karma thought kind that taints the soul with various colours based its soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates various states like heavens humans jains cite sufferings and pain evidence for the existence jain texts have classified the various types karma according their effects the potency the the jain theory seeks explain the karmic process specifying the various causes karmic influx and bondage placing equal emphasis deeds and the intentions behind those the jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility individual and eliminates reliance supposed existence divine grace the jain doctrine also holds that possible for both modify our and obtain release from through the austerities and purity cosmology jain cosmology jainism and creationism jain cosmology denies the existence supreme being responsible for creation and operation according jainism this loka universe uncreated existing since immutable beginningless and jain texts describe the shape the universe similar man standing with legs apart and arm resting his the universe according jainism narrow top and broad middle and once again becomes narrow the mah rya jinasena famous for his some foolish men declare that the creator made the the doctrine that the world was created ill advised and should god created the where was before the you say was

unique contribution this mainstream development philosophy occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues namely with those concerning the nature how knowledge and what way knowledge can said knowledge for the jains takes place the which without the limiting factor humans have partial knowledge the object knowledge known partially and the means knowledge not operate their full according tattv tra the knowledge the basic jaina truths can obtained pram means instruments knowledge which can yield comprehensive knowledge and naya particular yielding partial pram are five mati sensory sruta scriptural avadhi clairvoyance manahparyaya telepathy and omniscience the first two are described being indirect means knowledge parok with the others furnishing direct knowledge pratyak which meant that the object known directly the jains came out with their doctrines relativity used for logic and anek the theory relative pluralism the theory conditioned predication nayav the theory partial these philosophical concepts have made most important contributions the ancient indian philosophy especially the areas scepticism and anek anekantavada one the most important and fundamental doctrines jainism refers the principles pluralism and multiplicity the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points and that single point view the complete jains contrast all attempts proclaim absolute truth with adhgajany yah which can illustrated through the parable the blind men and elephant this each blind man felt different part elephant leg ear etc all the men claimed understand and explain the true appearance the but could only partly due their limited this principle more formally stated observing that objects are infinite their qualities and modes they cannot completely grasped all aspects and manifestations finite human according the only the kevalis omniscient can comprehend objects all aspects and others are only capable partial according the specific human view can claim represent absolute truth anek encourages its adherents consider the views and beliefs their rivals and opposing proponents anek apply this principle religion and reminding themselves that any religion even which clings too dogmatically its own committing error based its limited point the principle anek also influenced mohandas karamchand gandhi adopt principles religious ahi and satyagraha the theory conditioned predication which provides expression anek nta recommending that the epithet prefixed every phrase not only extension anek nta ontology but separate system logic capable standing its the sanskrit etymological root the term perhaps maybe but the context means some from reality single proposition can express the nature reality thus the term should prefixed before each proposition giving conditional point view and thus removing any dogmatism the since ensures that each statement expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints known saptibha the theory seven conditioned these seven also known saptibha are asti some sti some sti some and some and some and some and some each these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature reality from relative point view space substance and ignore the complexity reality commit the fallacy dogmatism nayav nayav the theory partial standpoints nayav compound two sanskrit words naya partial and school thought used arrive certain inference from point object has infinite aspects but when describe object speak only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant this does not deny the other qualities modes and other they are just irrelevant from particular authors like natubhai shah explain nayav with the example for when talk blue bmw are simply considering the color and make the however our statement does not imply that the car devoid other attributes like engine cylinders speed price and the this particular viewpoint called naya partial type critical philosophy nayav holds that all philosophical disputes arise out confusion and the standpoints adopt although may not realise the outcome purposes that may while operating within the limits language and seeing the complex nature used the language nayas naya being partial expression enables comprehend reality part ethics ahimsa jainism mahavrata the jain morality and ethics are rooted its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective jaina ethics evolved out the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated the mahavratas the five great vows ahimsa non violence satya truth asteya non stealing brahmacharya celibacy aparigraha non possession these ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality physical but also through verbal action and thus ahimsa has observed through speech and the other rules the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major jainism does not invoke fear reverence for god conformity the divine character reason for moral and observance the moral code not necessary simply because neither its observance necessary simply because altruistic conducive general welfare the state the rather egoistic imperative aimed while true that the moral and religious injunctions were laid down law arihants who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral their adherence just not please but because the life the arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive the own helping him reach spiritual just the arihants achieved moksha liberation observing the moral can who follows this atomism the most elaborate and preserved indian theory atomism comes from the philosophy the jaina school dating back least the century some the jain texts that refer matter and atoms are pancastikayasara kalpasutra tattvarthasutra and pannavana the jains envisioned the world consisting wholly except for param atoms were the basic building blocks their concept atoms was very similar classical differing primarily the specific properties each according jain has one kind one one and two kinds though unclear what was meant kind atoms can exist one two subtle which case they can fit infinitesimally small and which case they have extension and occupy finite certain characteristics correspond with that atomic for example characterized continuous motion either straight line case attractions from other follows curved this corresponds with the description orbit electrons across the ultimate particles are also described particles with positive snigdha smooth and negative ksa rough charges that provide them the binding although atoms are made the same basic they can combine based their eternal properties produce any six aggregates which seem correspond with the greek concept elements earth water shadow sense karmic and unfit the karma was but was mechanistic phenomenon caused buildups subtle karmic matter within the they also had detailed theories how atoms could react vibrate move and perform other which were thoroughly infinity the jain mathematical text surya prajnapti classifies numbers into three enumerable innumerable and each these was further subdivided into three enumerable lowest intermediate and highest nearly truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable nearly truly infinitely infinite the jains were the first discard the idea that all infinites were the same they recognized different types infinite length one dimension infinite area two infinite volume three and infinite perpetually infinite number according singh joseph and agrawal the highest enumerable number the jains corresponds the modern concept aleph null the cardinal number the infinite set integers the smallest cardinal transfinite number the jains also defined whole system infinite cardinal which the highest enumerable number the the jaina work the theory sets two basic types infinite numbers are both physical and ontological grounds distinction was made between asa innumerable and ananta unlimited between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded contributions indian philosophy jainism had major influence developing system philosophy and ethics that had major impact mohandas karamchand gandhi the scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically indian karma ahimsa moksa reincarnation and like either have their origins the shramana traditions were propagated and developed jain the sramanic ideal mendicancy and that the worldly life was full suffering and that emancipation required giving desires and withdrawal into lonely and contemplative was stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal active and ritually punctuated life based household duties and chants sramanas developed and laid emphasis karma moksa and schools and traditions jain philosophy arose from the shramana its years mahavira remained fundamentally the same preached mahavira who preached essentially the same religion the previous tirthankara however modified the four vows parshva adding fifth celibacy jain texts like the uttaradhyana sutra speak parallel existence the order parsva which was ultimately merged into mahaviras harry oldmeadow notes that the jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status the the schisms into mbara and digambara traditions arose mainly account differences question practice nudity amongst monks and liberation apart from these minor differences there are major philosophical differences between the different sects the tattv tra which encapsulates major philosophical accepted all traditions this coherence philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like jaini remark that the course history jainism heretical movements like tantric bhakti movement developed outside mainstream thus there are traditions within but basically the same philosophy that the core earlier traditions per the jain sangh was divided into two major mbaras believe that women can attain liberation and that nudity mbara scriptures support both acelakatva nudity monks and sacelakatva the wearing white clothes they also hold that the jain canon was not digambaras hold that nudity necessary for liberation and only men can attain the final stage attachment the body remaining they also hold that the canonical literature was eventually the now defunct yapaniya sect followed the digambara practice nudity and eating from the hands while standing along with mbara beliefs and they notably also permitted their ascetics ardhambara public areas the yapaniya sect was absorbed into the digambara community during the medieval medieval traditions the period century was period reforms the later schools arose against certain practices and belief that were perceived corrupting and not sanctioned the following schools arose during this sthanakvasi the arising from the mbara rejected idol worship unsanctioned terapanthi the digambara terapantha movement arose protest against the institution bhattarakas jain priestly usage flowers and offerings jain and worship minor terapanthi the also iconic arose from sthanakvasis account differences religious practices and recent developments recent events lead dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis austerities saw the arising two new sects within jainism the these were essentially led the laity rather than ascetics and soon became major force reckoned the sectarian cult shrimad rajchandra who was one the major influences mahatma now one the most popular another cult founded laying stress determinism and knowledge has gained large following jain philosophers jains hold the jain doctrine eternal and based universal the current time they trace the origins its philosophy the first however the tradition holds that the ancient jain texts and purvas which documented the jain doctrine were lost and historically the jain philosophy can traced from ras post mah many intellectual giants amongst the jain ascetics contributed and gave concrete form the jain philosophy
