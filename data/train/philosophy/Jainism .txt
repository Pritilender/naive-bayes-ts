points single one which jains contrast all attempts proclaim absolute truth with this which can illustrated through the parable the blind men and elephant this each blind man feels different part its leg ear and all them claim understand and explain the true appearance the elephant due their limited can only partly this principle more formally stated observing that objects are infinite their qualities and modes they cannot completely grasped all aspects and manifestations finite human only kevalins omniscient can comprehend objects all aspects and others are only capable partial accordingly specific human view can claim represent absolute truth anek encourages its adherents consider the views and beliefs their rivals and opposing proponents apply this principle religions and
