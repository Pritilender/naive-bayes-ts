action creates good does good bad action creates bad does bad karma also refers conceptual principle that originated often descriptively called the principle sometimes the karma theory the law the context karma complex and difficult different schools indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient indian their definition some combination causality that may ethical ethicization that good bad actions have and rebirth other indologists include the meaning karma that which explains the present circumstances individual with reference his her actions these actions may those current some schools indian possibly actions their past furthermore the consequences may result current future the difficulty arriving definition for karma arises because the diversity views among the various schools hinduism that exist and some for consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously some consider karma essential but not and few schools hinduism discuss and conclude karma and rebirth flawed buddhism and jainism have their karma karma thus has not rather multiple definitions and different concept whose importance and scope varies between buddhism jainism and other traditions that originated and various schools each these flaherty claims furthermore there going debate regarding whether karma metaphysical karma theory across different indian religious shares certain common causality ethicization and karma and causality common theme theories karma its principle one the earliest association karma causality occurs the brihadaranyaka upanishad for now man like this like according acts and according will man good acts will become man bad bad becomes pure pure bad bad and here they say that person consists and his his and his his and whatever deed that will brihadaranyaka upanishad the relationship karma causality central motif all schools jain and buddhist the theory karma causality holds that executed actions individual affects the individual and the life she and the intentions individual affects the individual and the life she disinterested unintentional actions not have the same positive negative karmic interested and intentional for actions that are originate without any bad intent such are considered existent karmic impact influence the another causality shared karmic that like deeds lead like thus good karma produces good effect the while bad karma produces bad this effect may moral emotional that one karma affects happiness and the effect karma need not the effect karma can later current and some schools extends future the consequence effects karma can described two phalas and samskaras phala fruit the visible invisible effect that typically immediate within the current samskaras are always those invisible effect that are produced inside the actor because the thus transforming the agent and affecting his her ability happy unhappy this life well future the theory karma often presented the context samskaras karmic principle can suggests karl principle psychology and karma seeds habits and habits create the nature karma also seeds self and perception influences how one experiences life both habits and self perception affect the course breaking bad habit not requires conscious karmic effort for release from cycle negative thus psyche and suggests well other link karma causality ancient indian the idea karma may compared the notion character suggests both are assessment the person and determined that habitual thinking and karma and ethicization the second theme common karma theories this begins with the premise that every action has which will come fruition either this future thus morally good acts will have positive whereas bad acts will produce negative present situation thereby explained reference actions his present previous karma not itself reward and but the law producing halbfass good karma considered dharma and leads punya while bad karma considered adharma and leads sin the theories karma are ethical suggests this because the ancient scholars india linked intent and actual action the reward demerit and theory without ethical premise would pure causal the merit reward demerit punishment would same regardless the one attitudes and desires matter the evaluation where the outcome suggests the moral responsibility for less the even though causal responsibility may the same karma theory considers not only the but also attitude and desires before and during the the karma concept thus encourages each person seek and live moral well avoid immoral the meaning and significance karma thus building block ethical karma and rebirth the third common theme karma theories the concept reincarnation rebirth rebirth fundamental concept buddhism jainism and the concept has been intensely debated ancient literature with different schools indian religions considering the relevance rebirth either unnecessary karma basic rebirth derivative suggests karma fact asserts while reincarnation suggests rebirth necessary corollary rebirth the concept that all life forms through cycle that series births and the rebirths and consequent life may different condition the karma theories suggest that the condition and form depends the quality and quantity schools that believe every living soul transmigrates after carrying the seeds karmic impulses from life just into another life and lifetime this cycle continues except for those who consciously break this cycle reaching moksa those who break the cycle reach the realm those who continue the the theory karma and raises numerous such when and why did the cycle start the first what the relative karmic merit one karma versus another and and what evidence there that rebirth actually among various schools hinduism realized these debated their own some reaching what they considered internally consistent while other schools modified and emphasized while few schools hinduism such lokayatana abandoned karma and theory schools buddhism consider rebirth cycle integral their theories soteriology history the earliest known occurrence karman ancient indian literature where occurs some times there means work and the context ritual sacrificial satapatha brahmana the word karma appears with expanded context where sacrifice declared the greatest while satapatha brahmana associates the potential becoming amara immortal with the fire altar agnicayana karma however none these sources unambiguously link karma ethicization and the earliest unambiguous presentation karma doctrine appears the for the causality and ethicization occurs ranyaka had and again truly one becomes good through good and evil through evil brihadaranyaka upanishad unclear how and who invented the principle karma for the first development that ultimately led eloquent phrases upanishads and those the literature buddhism and some scholars suggest the concept karma may have originated the shramana tradition which buddhism and jainism are obeyesekere offers alternate first shows that the idea rebirth not unique rebirth theories emerged ancient times greece melanesia and obeyesekere goes suggest that tribal teachers the ganges valley may have provided the inspiration for the karma flaherty notes that this merely shifting one unknown with another because know nothing about these hypothetical tribal other crediting unknown sages for karma doctrine may simply scholarly way admitting that not know who invented the karma scholars suggest least some the complex ideas the then developing theory karma flowed from vedic thinkers buddhist and jain for the question whether karma can transferred from one person another sraddha troubled many schools well jainas and sraddha rites literature traceable have originated vedic mcdermott has demonstrated that buddhists struggled with sraddha while jaini shows jainism scholars would not allow the possibility karma this dynamic suggests that scholars buddhism and jainism were sharing debating evolving and forming their own conclusions appropriate karmic doctrine over period indian corollaries and controversies the theory karma has several such its implication free will and the practice karma transfer between karma free will and destiny one the significant controversies with the karma doctrine whether always implies and its implications free this controversy also referred the moral agency problem the controversy not unique karma but found some form all theistic the free will controversy can outlined three person who rapes commits any other unjust can claim all his bad actions were product his devoid free can not make agent and that merely delivering necessary punishments his wicked victims deserved for their own karma past are crimes and unjust actions due free because forces does person who suffers from unnatural death loved rape any other unjust assume moral gratuitous harm and seek should one blame oneself for bad karma over past assume that the unjust suffering does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for education because all suffering deserved and consequence past why learn anything when the balance sheet karma from past lives will determine action and the explanations and replies the above free will problem vary the specific school buddhism and the replies offered remain the schools such yoga and advaita that have emphasized current life over the dynamics karma residue moving across past allow free their well other are the theory karma includes both the action and the intent behind that not only one affected past one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent good intent and act can proven beyond reasonable new karma can and the process justice can proceed against this new the actor who rapes commits any other unjust must considered the moral agent for this new and life forms not only receive and reap the consequence their past together they are the means evaluate judge give and deliver consequence karma karma theory that explains some not all see moral evil versus natural evil other schools well buddhism and jainism that consider cycle rebirths central their and that karma from past lives affects believe that both free will cetan and karma can however their answers have not persuaded all psychological indeterminacy another issue with the theory karma that psychologically suggests that one can know what their karma was previous and the karma from past lives can determine then the individual psychologically unclear what anything she can now shape the more reduce something goes wrong such sickness failure work the individual unclear karma from past lives was the the sickness was caused curable infection and the failure was caused something this psychological indeterminacy problem also not unique the theory found every religion with the premise that god has some way influences human with karma and free will problem schools that insist primacy rebirths face the most their answers psychological indeterminacy issue the same those for addressing the free will transferability karma some schools asian particularly allow transfer karma merit and demerit from one person this transfer exchange physical quality just like exchange physical goods between two human the practice karma even its karma transfer raises questions similar those with substitutionary atonement and vicarious defeats the ethical dissociates the causality and ethicization the theory karma from the moral proponents some buddhist schools suggest that the concept karma merit transfer encourages religious and such transfers are not mechanism transfer bad karma from one person another that demerit sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled karma merit transfer ceremonies few and disputed other schools hinduism such the yoga and advaita vedantic philosophies and jainism hold that karma can not eastern interpretation hinduism karma hinduism karma concept hinduism developed and evolved over the earliest upanishads began with the questions about how and why man and what happens after answers the the early theories these ancient sanskrit include pancagni vidya the five fire pitryana the cyclic path and devayana the path the those who superficial rituals and seek material claimed these ancient travel the way their fathers and recycle back into another those who into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge were claimed climb into the higher path the these who break the cycle and are not with the composition the epics the common introduction dharma hinduism the ideas causality and essential elements the theory karma were being recited folk for man himself himself man inherits the good evil act another the fruit the same quality the mahabharata the thirteenth book the also called the teaching book anushasana parva sixth chapter opens with yudhisthira asking the course life already can human effort shape the replies both function current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the over and over the chapters mahabharata recite the key postulates karma that intent and action has karma lingers and and all positive negative experiences life require effort and for happiness comes due good suffering results from evil all things are nothing whatsoever action bore then everything would the world worked from fate would mahabharata over various schools hinduism developed many different definitions some making karma appear quite while others make room for free will and moral among the six most studied schools the theory karma evolved different their respective scholars reasoned and attempted address the internal implications and issues the karma according nyaya school hinduism considers karma and rebirth vaisesika school does not consider karma from past lives doctrine very samkhya school considers karma secondary importance prakrti mimamsa school gives negligible role karma from past disregards samsara and yoga school considers karma from past lives one behavior and psychology the current life what has consequences and leads vedanta school acknowledges rebirth but concludes theory that not derived from reality and cannot considers invalid for its failure explain evil inequality other observable facts about treats convenient fiction solve practical problems upanishadic and declares the advaita vedanta actions current life have moral consequences and liberation possible within life jivanmukti realized the above six schools illustrate the diversity but are not each school has schools such vedanta nondualism and dualism furthermore there are other schools hinduism such lokayata the who denied theory rebirth well the existence this school the properties things come from the nature causality emerges from the actions and nature things and determinative principles such karma god are sikhism sikhism all living beings are described being under the influence maya three always present together varying mix

when these two components consciousness and interact experience the life know herman quoting from tattvarthasutra describes karmas mechanism that makes thoroughly experience the themes our life until gained optimal knowledge from them and until our emotional attachment these themes falls according padmanabh jaini his emphasis reaping the fruits only own karma was not restricted the both hindus and buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same each the latter however developed practices basic contradiction such addition shrardha the ritual hindu offerings the son find among hindus widespread adherence the notion divine intervention ones while buddhists eventually came propound such theories like granting transfer merit and only jainas have been absolutely unwilling allow such ideas penetrate their despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount social pressure them the key points where the theory karma jainism differs from the other religions such theistic traditions can stated karma operates sustaining mechanism natural universal without any need external entity manage absence the exogenous divine jainism advocates that karma changes even with the and not just the thus even think evil someone would endure karma bandha increment bad for this the ratnatraya gives very strong emphasis samyak dhyan rationality and samyak rationality and not just samyak rationality jain soul released worldly affairs soon able emancipate from the famous illustration that the mother rishabha the first tirthankara the present time who reached such emancipation elevating sequentially her thought while she was visiting her tirthankara this illustration explains how nirvana and moksha are different than other religions the presence another soul achieved kevala jnana and subsequently without any need intervention the the karmic theory jainism operates tirthankaras are not attributed godhood thus even the tirthankaras themselves have through the stages for attaining that while buddhism does give similar and some extent matching account for gautama hinduism maintains totally different theory where divine needed for jainism treats all souls

shintoism view karma means empowering and life affirming falun gong ownby claims that falun gong differs from buddhism its definition the term karma that taken not process award and but exclusively negative the chinese term virtue reserved for what might otherwise termed good karma understood the source all suffering what buddhism might refer bad person has done bad things over his many and for people this results for cultivators karmic aging sickness and this ordinary falun gong teaches that the spirit locked the cycle also known samsara due the accumulation this black substance that accumulates other dimensions lifetime after doing bad deeds and thinking bad falun gong states that karma the reason for and what ultimately blocks people from the truth the universe and attaining the same also the cause ones continued rebirth and says that due accumulation karma the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over until the karma paid off eliminated through the person destroyed due the bad deeds has ownby regards the concept karma cornerstone individual moral behaviour falun and also readily traceable the christian doctrine one reaps what one others say matthew

that the eyes higher the purpose human life not merely but awaken quickly setting and that what they really have they are opening door for those who fail return will have choice but reincarnate with this continuing until they amass huge amount karma and are ownby regards this the basis for falun apparent opposition taking medicine when they are missing opportunity work off karma allowing illness run its course suffering depletes fight the illness through penny shares this since believes that karma the primary factor that causes sickness penny disease comes from karma and karma can eradicated through cultivation xinxing then what good will medicine himself states that not forbidding practitioners from taking maintaining that what doing telling people the relationship between practicing
