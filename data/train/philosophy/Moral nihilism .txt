nihilism also known ethical nihilism the meta ethical view that nothing intrinsically moral for moral nihilist would say that killing for whatever neither inherently right nor inherently moral nihilists consider morality complex set rules and recommendations that may give social economical advantage its but otherwise without universal even relative truth any moral nihilism distinct from moral relativism which does allow for moral statements true false objective but does not assign any static truth values moral and course moral universalism which holds moral statements objectively true insofar only true statements can moral nihilism implies moral skepticism contents forms moral nihilism expressivism error theory global falsity presupposition failure moral nihilists history criticisms see also references bibliography and further reading forms moral nihilism according armstrong the basic thesis moral nihilism that nothing morally there however several forms that this thesis can take see and russ there are two important forms moral error theory and expressivism expressivism one form moral nihilism expressivism denies the principle that our moral judgments try and fail describe the moral because expressivists believe when someone says something immoral they are not saying right expressivists are not trying speak the truth when making moral they are simply trying express their are not making effort describe the way the world are not trying report the moral features possessed various motives instead are venting our commanding others act certain revealing plan when condemn for are expressing our opposition indicating our disgust publicizing our reluctance perform and strongly encouraging others not for can all these things without trying say anything that this makes expressivism form non cognitivism non cognitivism ethics the view that moral statements lack value and not assert genuine this involves rejection the cognitivist shared other moral that moral statements seek describe some feature the garner this position its own logically compatible with realism about moral values that one could reasonably hold that there are objective moral values but that cannot know them and that our moral language does not seek refer this would amount endorsement type moral rather than typically however the rejection the cognitivist thesis combined with the thesis that there moral facts van but moral statements cannot and one cannot know something that not non cognitivism implies that moral knowledge impossible garner not all forms cognitivism are forms moral however notably the universal prescriptivism hare cognitivist form moral error theory error theory built three there are moral features this nothing right therefore moral judgments are however our sincere moral judgments but always describe the moral features thus always lapse into error when thinking moral are trying state the truth when make moral but since there moral all our moral claims are hence the these three principles lead the conclusion that there moral knowledge requires there moral there can moral thus moral values are purely error theorists combine the cognitivist thesis that moral language consists apt statements with the nihilist thesis that there are moral like moral nihilism however error theory comes more than one global falsity and presupposition failure global falsity the which one might call the global falsity form error claims that moral beliefs and assertions are false that they claim that certain moral facts that not exist fact mackie argues for this form moral mackie argues that moral assertions are only true there are moral properties that are intrinsically but there good reason believe that there are such intrinsically motivating properties see the argument from queerness and motivational internalism presupposition failure the second which one might call the presupposition failure form error claims that moral beliefs and assertions are not true because they are neither true nor this not form non cognitivism for moral assertions are still thought truth apt rather this form moral nihilism claims that moral beliefs and assertions presuppose the existence moral facts that not this analogous presupposition failure cases moral take for the claim that the present king france some argue that this claim apt that has the logical form but neither true nor false because presupposes that there currently king but there the claim suffers from presupposition richard joyce argues for this form moral nihilism under the name moral nihilists history the philosophy niccol machiavelli sometimes presented model moral but this best his book principe the prince praised many acts violence and which shocked european tradition that throughout the middle ages had inculcated moral lessons its political machiavelli does say that the prince must override traditional moral rules favor maintaining reasons but also particularly his other that the successful ruler should guided pagan rather than christian virtues hence machiavelli presents alternative the ethical theories his rather than out rejection all closer being example moral nihilism thrasymachus portrayed plato republic thrasymachus for that rules justice are structured benefit those who are able dominate political and social thrasymachus however interpreted offering revisionary account rather than total rejection morality and normative discourse glover has cited realist views amoralism held early athenians and some ethical positions affirmed joseph stalin criticisms criticisms moral nihilism come primarily from moral realists citation needed who argue that there are positive moral still criticisms arise out the other realist camps subjectivists and relativists not only but each school moral nihilism has its own criticisms one another the critique error theory for accepting the semantic thesis moral citation needed still other detractors deny that the basis moral objectivity need the moral naturalist though form moral agrees with the critique metaphysical justifications for right and moral naturalists prefer define morality terms observables some even appealing science morality citation needed see also evolution morality nihilism cognitivism moral relativism moral skepticism morality perspectivism psychological determinism
