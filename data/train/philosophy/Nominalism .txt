either two metaphysical positions regarding what exists nominalism may refer position that denies the existence universal entities but accepts that particular objects entities may refer denial the existence abstract objects while accepting the existence concrete objects each position contrasted with nihilism which denies the existence nominalism either the assertion that everything that exists particular that everything that exists nominalism metaphysical view philosophy according which general abstract terms and predicates exist while universals abstract objects which are sometimes thought correspond these not there are least two main versions one version denies the existence universals things that can instantiated exemplified many particular things strength humanity the other version specifically denies the existence abstract objects objects that not exist space and most nominalists have held that only physical particulars space and time are and that universals exist only post res that subsequent particular however some versions nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities numbers while others are concrete entities entities that exist space and time tables chairs nominalism primarily position the problem universals which dates back least plato and opposed realism the view that universals exist over and above however the name nominalism emerged from debates medieval philosophy with roscellinus the term stems from the for john stuart mill once that there nothing general except the philosophy law nominalism finds its application what called constitutional nominalism contents the problem universals varieties nominalism analytic philosophy and mathematics history criticisms see also notes references and further reading external links the problem universals nominalism arose reaction the problem universals specifically accounting for the fact that some things are the same for fluffy and kitzler are both cats the fact that certain properties are such the the shirt and kermit the frog are one wants know virtue what are fluffy and kitzler both and what makes the the and kermit the realist answer that all the green things are green virtue the existence single abstract thing this part all the green with respect the color the the shirt and one their parts this the three parts are literally greenness repeatable because there one thing that manifests itself wherever there are green nominalism denies the existence the motivation for this flows from several the first one being where they might plato famously one that there realm abstract forms universals apart from the physical world see theory the forms particular physical objects merely exemplify instantiate the but this raises the where this universal one possibility that outside space and view sympathetic with this possibility holds precisely because some form immanent several physical must also transcend each those physical this the forms are transcendent only insofar they are immanent many physical other immanence implies they are not opposed one this would there separate world realm forms that distinct from the physical thus shirking much the worry about where locate universal however naturalists assert that nothing outside space and some neoplatonists such the pagan philosopher plotinus and the christian philosopher augustine imply anticipating conceptualism that universals are contained within the mind god complicate what the nature the instantiation exemplification relation conceptualists hold position intermediate between nominalism and realism saying that universals exist only within the mind and have external substantial moderate realists hold that there realm which universals but rather universals are located space and time wherever they are now recall that like supposed single nominalists consider unusual that there could single thing that exists multiple places the realist maintains that all the instances greenness are held together the exemplification but this relation cannot finally many philosophers prefer simpler ontologies populated with only the bare minimum types quine said they have taste for desert they try express everything that they want explain without using universals such catness varieties nominalism there are various forms nominalism ranging from extreme one extreme predicate nominalism which states that fluffy and for are both cats simply because the predicate applies both and this the case for all similarity attribute among the main criticism this view that does not provide sufficient solution the problem fails provide account what makes the case that group things warrant having the same predicate applied resemblance nominalists believe that applies both cats because fluffy and kitzler resemble exemplar cat closely enough classed together with members its kind that they differ from each other and other quite less than they differ from other and this warrants classing them some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation itself but the only universal others argue that each resemblance relation and resemblance relation simply virtue its resemblance other resemblance this generates infinite but many argue that not vicious class nominalism argues that class membership forms the metaphysical backing for property two particular red balls share property that they are both members classes corresponding their that being red and being version class nominalism that sees some classes natural held anthony quinton conceptualism philosophical theory that explains universality particulars conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept universals from perspective that denies their presence particulars outside the perception another form nominalism trope theory trope particular instance like the specific greenness one might argue that there objective resemblance relation that holds among like another route argue that all apparent tropes are constructed out more primitive tropes and that the most primitive tropes are the entities complete physics primitive trope resemblance may thus accounted for terms causal indiscernibility two tropes are exactly resembling substituting one for the other would make difference the events which they are taking varying degrees resemblance the macro level can explained varying degrees resemblance the micro and level resemblance explained terms something less robustly physical than causal david armstrong perhaps the most prominent contemporary argues that such based variant nominalism has but holds that unable account for the laws nature the way his theory universals citation needed ian hacking has also argued that much what called social constructionism science contemporary times actually motivated unstated nominalist metaphysical for this scientists and constructionists tend shout past each analytic philosophy and mathematics notion that especially ontology and the philosophy mathematics should abstain from set theory owes much the writings nelson goodman see especially goodman who argued that concrete and abstract entities having called individuals exist collections individuals likewise but two collections having the same individuals are the same the principle extensionality set theory assures that any matching pair curly braces enclosing one more instances the same individuals denote the same hence are all the same for goodman and other also identical and any combination matching curly braces and one more instances and long and are names individuals and not collections goodman richard milton martin and willard quine all advocated reasoning about collectivities means theory virtual sets see especially quine one making possible all elementary operations sets except that the universe quantified variable cannot contain any virtual the foundation mathematics nominalism has come mean doing mathematics without assuming that sets the mathematical sense this means that quantified variables may range over universes numbers points primitive ordered pairs and other abstract ontological but not over sets whose members are such only small fraction the corpus modern mathematics can rederived nominalistic history plato was perhaps the first writer western philosophy clearly state nominalist which plainly customarily hypothesize single form connection with each the many things which apply the same for there are many beds and but there are only two forms such one the bed and one the republic trans grube what about someone who believes beautiful but believe the beautiful don you think living dream rather than wakened republic the platonic universals corresponding the names bed and beautiful were the form the bed and the form the the bed itself and the beautiful itself platonic forms were the first universals posited such our term universal due the english translation aristotle technical term katholou which coined specially for the purpose discussing the problem katholou contraction the phrase kata holou meaning the aristotle famously rejected certain aspects theory but clearly rejected nominalism and indeed every general signifies not but some quantity something that sophistical refutations xxii trans pickard applied nominalism redirects the thesis nomalism the highest level self actualism whereby all individuals are equal and collectively creates community actualism where everyone without nominalism thus categorical but without hierarchy and leads directing thought towards the general idea the community rather than the individual alice wonderland the problem nominalism presented anecdotal example when use humpty dumpty said rather scornful means just what choose mean neither more nor the question said whether you can make words mean many different criticisms critique the historical origins the category late medieval the concept has been
