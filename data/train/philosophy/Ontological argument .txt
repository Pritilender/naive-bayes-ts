faith and rationality ontological argument any one category philosophical arguments for the existence god using ontology many arguments fall under the category the but they tend involve arguments about the state being more ontological arguments tend start with priori theory about the organization the that organizational structure the argument will provide reasons why god must widely accepted that the first ontological argument was proposed anselm canterbury his proslogion anselm defined god that than which nothing greater can and then argued that this being must exist the even the mind the fool who denies the existence suggested the greatest possible being exists the must also exist only exists the greater being one which exists the mind and therefore this greatest possible being must exist seventeenth century french philosopher ren descartes deployed similar descartes published several variations his each which centered the idea that existence immediately inferable from clear and idea supremely perfect the early eighteenth gottfried leibniz augmented ideas attempt prove that supremely being coherent more recent ontological argument came from kurt del who proposed formal argument for norman malcolm revived the ontological argument when located stronger ontological argument alvin plantinga challenged this argument and proposed based modal logic attempts have also been made validate proof using automated theorem prover other arguments have been categorized including those made islamic philosopher mulla sadra the first critic the ontological argument was gaunilo marmoutiers used the analogy perfect suggesting that the ontological argument could used prove the existence this was the first many parodies all which attempted show that the argument has absurd consequences later thomas aquinas rejected the argument the basis that humans cannot know also david hume offered empirical criticising its lack evidential reasoning and rejecting the idea that anything can exist immanuel kant critique was based what saw the false premise that existence predicate argued that existing adds nothing including the essence and thus supremely being can conceived not finally philosophers including broad dismissed the coherence maximally great proposing that some attributes greatness are incompatible with rendering maximally great incoherent contents classification development anselm ren descartes gottfried leibniz mulla sadra kurt del norman malcolm alvin plantinga sankara dictum automated reasoning criticisms and objections gaunilo thomas aquinas david hume immanuel kant douglas gasking coherence maximally great being other criticisms notes bibliography external links classification the traditional definition ontological argument was given immanuel contrasted the ontological argument literally any argument concerned with with the cosmological and theoretical according the kantian ontological arguments are those founded priori reasoning graham oppy who elsewhere expressed the view that urgent depart from the traditional defined ontological arguments those that begin with nothing but priori and necessary and conclude that god oppy however that not all the traditional ontological argument necessity and are found all ontological arguments and his work ontological arguments and belief god suggested that better definition ontological argument would employ only considerations entirely internal the theistic oppy subclassified ontological arguments into conceptual modal meinongian experiential mereological higher hegelian based the qualities their defined these qualities definitional arguments invoke conceptual arguments invoke the possession certain kinds ideas modal arguments consider meinongian arguments assert distinction between different categories experiential arguments employ the idea that god exists solely those who have had experience and hegelian arguments are from hegel later categorized mereological arguments that draw the theory the part william lane craig criticized study too vague for useful craig argued that argument can classified ontological attempts deduce the existence along with other necessary from his suggested that proponents ontological arguments would claim one fully understood the concept one must accept his william rowe defined ontological arguments those that start from the definition god using only priori conclude with development although the ontological argument may have been implicit the works greek philosophers such plato and the neoplatonists the mainstream view that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed anselm canterbury some scholars argued that the islamic philosopher avicenna ibn developed special kind ontological argument before but other scholars have doubted this daniel dombrowski marked three major stages the development the anselm initial explicit the eighteenth century criticisms kant and and the identification second ontological argument proslogion twentieth century anselm theologian and philosopher anselm canterbury proposed ontological argument the second and third chapters his proslogion anselm argument was not presented order prove rather proslogion was work meditation which documented how the idea god became evident chapter the proslogion anselm defined god being than which greater can suggested that even the can understand this and this understanding itself means that the being must exist the the concept must exist either only our both our mind and such being exists only our then greater that which exists the mind and can therefore can conceive being than which nothing greater can must exist thus being than which nothing greater could which anselm defined must exist anselm argument chapter can summarized our understanding god being than which greater can the idea god exists the being that exists both the mind and reality greater than being that exists only the god only exists the then can conceive greater that which exists cannot imagine something that greater than therefore god chapter anselm presented the notion being that cannot conceived not argued that something can conceived not then something greater can consequently thing than which nothing greater can conceived cannot conceived not exist and must this can read restatement the argument chapter although norman malcolm believed stronger ren descartes ren descartes composed number ontological which differed from generally they are less formal arguments than natural descartes wrote the fifth meditation but the mere fact that can produce from thought the idea something that entails everything that clearly and distinctly perceive belong that thing really does belong not this possible basis for another argument prove the existence certainly the idea supremely perfect one that find within just surely the idea any shape and understanding that belongs his nature that always exists less clear and distinct than the case when prove any shape number that some property belongs its descartes argued that existence can deduced from his just geometric ideas can deduced from the nature used the deduction the sizes angles triangle suggested that the concept god that supremely perfect holding all seems have assumed that existence predicate thus the notion god did not include would not supremely would lacking consequently the notion supremely perfect god who does not descartes therefore according his god must gottfried leibniz gottfried wilhelm leibniz saw problem with ontological that descartes had not asserted the coherence supremely being proposed unless the coherence supremely perfect being could the ontological argument leibniz saw perfection impossible therefore would impossible demonstrate that all perfections are reasoned that all perfections can exist together single and that argument still mulla sadra transcendent theosophy mulla sadra was iranian shia islamic philosopher who was influenced earlier muslim philosophers such avicenna and well the sufi metaphysician ibn sadra discussed arguments for the existence claiming that they were not priori rejected the argument the basis that existence precedes essence that the existence human beings more fundamental than their sadra put forward new known argument the righteous the argument attempts prove the existence god through the reality and conclude with eternal this thing demonstrated through and path identical with the other the truth attained from external such from the possible the from the originated the eternal from motion the unmoved the argument the there middle term other than the his version the ontological argument can summarized there existence existence perfection above which perfection may conceived god perfection and perfection existence existence singular and simple there metaphysical pluralism that singular reality graded intensity scale perfection that denial pure monism that scale must have limit point greatest intensity and greatest hence god mulla sadra describes this argument his main work asfar four existence objective and simple and there difference between its unless terms perfection and strength and and the culmination its where there nothing more its independence from any other nothing more perfect should every imperfect thing belongs another thing and needs become and has already been perfection prior actuality and existence also has been explained that the perfection thing the thing and not thing addition thus either existence independent others need the former the which pure nothing more perfect than and him there room for existence the latter other than and regarded his acts and and for other than him there unless through for there imperfection the reality and imperfection added existence only because the quality being impossible for effect identical with its cause terms kurt del ontological proof mathematician kurt del provided formal argument for god existence the argument was constructed del but not published until long after his provided logically valid argument based modal uses the conception ultimately concluding with definition like and only has essential properties those and only those properties which are positive definition essence and only for every property has necessarily and only entails definition necessarily exists and only every essence necessarily exemplified axiom property then its negation not positive axiom any property entailed strictly implied positive property positive axiom the property being like positive axiom property then necessarily positive axiom necessary existence positive axiom for any property then being necessarily positive theorem property then possibly exemplified corollary the property being like consistent theorem something then the property being like essence that thing theorem necessarily the property being like exemplified del defined being having every positive left the term positive undefined del proposed that understood aesthetic and moral alternatively the opposite privation the absence necessary qualities the warned against interpreting positive being morally aesthetically good the greatest advantage and least this includes negative instead suggested that positive should interpreted being purely without negative listed theorems follow from the most criticisms the theory focus those axioms the assumptions oppy argued that del gives definition positive suggested that these positive properties form there reason believe that any such set exists which theologically that there only one set positive properties which theologically norman malcolm norman malcolm published anselm ontological argument sought distinguish what saw two ontological arguments proposed anselm chapters and his proslogion malcolm supported criticism argument chapter that existence cannot perfection however identified what sees second ontological argument chapter which not susceptible such malcolm identified two key arguments first that being whose existence logically impossible greater than being whose existence logically and that god being than which greater cannot malcolm supported that definition god and suggested that makes the proposition existence logically necessarily true statement the same way that square has four logically necessarily thus while rejecting the idea existence itself being malcolm argued that necessary existence this proved the existence unsurpassably great necessary alvin plantinga analytic philosopher alvin plantinga criticized and offered argued malcolm does prove the necessary existence the greatest possible follows that there being which exists all worlds whose greatness some worlds not does demonstrate that such being has unsurpassed greatness this attempt resolve this plantinga differentiated between greatness and excellence excellence particular world depends only its properties that greatness depends its properties all therefore the greatest possible being must have maximal excellence every possible plantinga then restated using the concept maximal argued that possible for being with maximal greatness being with maximal greatness exists possible this the then being with maximal greatness exists every and therefore this the conclusion relies form modal axiom which states that something possibly then its possibility necessary possibly true all plantinga also states that something possibly necessarily then necessarily true true all other something not inherently contradictory possibly then possibly true all worlds including the actual version his argument being has maximal excellence given possible world and only omniscient and wholly good and being has maximal greatness has maximal excellence every possible possible that there being that has maximal therefore possibly necessarily true that omnipotent and perfectly good being therefore axiom necessarily true that omnipotent and perfectly good being therefore omnipotent and perfectly good being plantinga argued although the first premise not rationally not contrary michael martin argued certain components perfection are such omnipotence and then the first premise contrary martin also proposed parodies the suggesting that the existence anything can demonstrated with provided defined perfect special every possible richard gale argued that premise the possibility begs the question stated that one only has the epistemic right accept the premise one understands the nested modal operators and that one understands them within the system without which the argument then one understands that possibly essence the same necessarily thus the premise begs the question because the conclusion embedded within juan manuel correa the university oxford argued that the argument can used prove that god does not exist simply affirming that possible that god does not exist being has maximal excellence given possible world and only omniscient and wholly good and being has maximal greatness has maximal excellence every possible possible that there not being that has maximal therefore possibly necessarily true that omnipotent and perfectly good being does not therefore axiom necessarily true that omnipotent and perfectly good being does not therefore omnipotent and perfectly good being does not sankara dictum approach supporting the possibility premise version the argument was attempted alexander pruss started with the century indian philosopher sankara dictum that something cannot have perception even veridical that the follows that have perception that then even though might not the case that least the case that possibly mystics fact perceive the existence maximally great follows that the existence maximally great being least automated reasoning paul oppenheimer and edward zalta used automated theorem prover validate ontological prover subsequently discovered formally valid not necessarily sound ontological argument from single logical criticisms and objections gaunilo one the earliest recorded objections argument was raised one gaunilo marmoutiers invited his reader conceive island more than any other suggested according this island must necessarily island that exists would more gaunilo criticism does not explicitly demonstrate flaw rather argues that argument are many other arguments the same logical form which cannot offered further criticism ontological suggesting that the notion god cannot anselm had argued that many theists would accept that cannot fully therefore humans cannot fully conceive the ontological argument cannot anselm responded criticism arguing that the argument applied only concepts with necessary suggested that only being with necessary existence can fulfill the remit that than which nothing greater can furthermore contingent such could always improved and thus could never reach state for that anselm dismissed any argument that did not relate being with necessary other parodies have been including the devil corollary the devil corollary and the extreme devil the devil corollary proposes that being than which nothing worse can conceived exists the understanding sometimes the term lesser used place using logical the parody argues that exists the worse being would one that exists thus such being the devil corollary but argues that worse being would one that does not exist does not the extreme devil corollary advances proposing that worse being would that which does not exist the such being exists neither reality nor the timothy chambers argued that the devil corollary more powerful than challenge because withstands the challenges that may defeat also claimed that the devil corollary strong underwrites the devil which threatens argument its very thomas aquinas thomas aquinas while proposing five proofs existence his summa theologica objected suggested that people cannot know the nature god therefore cannot conceive god the way anselm the ontological argument would meaningful only someone who understands the essence god aquinas reasoned only god can completely know his only could use the his rejection the ontological argument caused other catholic theologians also reject the david hume scottish philosopher and empiricist david hume argued that nothing can proven exist using only priori reasoning his dialogues concerning natural religion the character cleanthes proposes there evident absurdity pretending demonstrate matter prove any arguments priori nothing unless the contrary implies nothing that distinctly implies whatever conceive can also conceive there therefore whose existence implies consequently there whose existence hume also suggested have abstract idea existence apart from part our ideas other cannot claim that the idea god implies his suggested that any conception god may can conceive either existing not believed that existence not quality completely perfect being need not thus claimed that not contradiction deny although this criticism directed against cosmological argument similar that samuel clarke his first boyle lecture has been applied ontological arguments immanuel kant immanuel kant put forward influential objection the ontological argument his critique pure reason the critique was primarily and explicitly directed but also attacked kant refutation consists several separate but interrelated shaped his central distinction between analytic and synthetic analytic the predicate expresses something that already contained within concept and therefore tautology synthetic the links the concept something outside that not conceptually contained within new knowledge consists synthetic kant questioned the intelligibility the concept necessary considered examples necessary such triangle has three and rejected the transfer this logic the existence god first argued that such necessary propositions are necessarily true only such being triangle must have three the necessary does not make the existence triangle thus argued the proposition would follow exists this does not mean that exists second argued that contradictions arise only when the subject and predicate are maintained therefore judgement existence cannot denies the kant then proposed that the statement god must analytic the predicate must inside outside the respectively the proposition the ontological argument takes then the statement would true only because the meaning given the kant claimed that this merely tautology and cannot say anything about however the statement the ontological argument does not the existence god not contained within the definition god evidence for god would need kant goes obviously not real and cannot part the concept proposed that existence not this because existence does not add the essence but merely indicates its occurrence stated that taking the subject god with all its predicates and then asserting that god add new predicate the conception argued that the ontological argument works only existence this not then conceivable for completely perfect being not thus defeating the ontological kant claimed that the concept god not one particular rather object pure asserted that god exists outside the realm experience and because cannot experience god through kant argued that impossible know how would verify this contrast material which can verified means the douglas gasking australian philosopher douglas gasking developed version the ontological argument meant prove was not intended rather its purpose was illustrate the problems gasking saw the ontological gasking asserted that the creation the world the most marvellous achievement the merit such achievement the product its quality and the the greater the disability the the more impressive the non gasking would the greatest therefore the universe the product existent could conceive greater one which does not existent creator greater than one which god does not gasking proposition that the greatest disability would existence response assumption that existence predicate and gasking uses this logic assume that existence must oppy criticized the viewing weak parody the ontological stated although may accepted that would greater achievement for existent creator create something than creator who there reason assume that existent creator would greater continued arguing that there reason view the creation the world the most marvellous achievement finally stated that may inconceivable for existent being create anything coherence maximally great being his development the ontological leibniz attempted demonstrate the coherence supremely perfect broad countered that two characteristics necessary for perfection are incompatible with the notion supremely perfect being becomes the ontological argument assumes the definition god purported classical theism that god omnipotent omniscient and morally kenneth einar himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may god then should able create being with free then should know exactly what such being will thus rendering them without free this analysis would render the ontological argument the characteristics required maximally great being cannot coexist one thus such being could not other criticisms bertrand russell during his early hegelian phase accepted the once great god the ontological argument however later criticized the asserting that the argument does modern seem very but easier feel convinced that must fallacious than find out precisely where the fallacy drew distinction between existence and arguing that the essence person can described and their existence still remain biologist richard dawkins his book the god delusion rejects the argument infantile noting that scientist rather than the very idea that such grand conclusions should follow from such logomachist trickery offends also feels deep suspicion any line reasoning that reached such significant conclusion without feeding single piece data from the real
