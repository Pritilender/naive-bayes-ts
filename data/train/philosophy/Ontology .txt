overview ontology analytic philosophy concerns the determination whether some categories being are fundamental and asks what sense can the items those categories said the inquiry into being much being being qua being into beings insofar they and not insofar for particular facts can obtained about them particular properties belong citation needed some notably the platonic school contend that all nouns including abstract nouns refer existent other philosophers contend that nouns not always name but that some provide kind shorthand for reference collection either objects events this latter mind instead referring refers collection mental events experienced person society refers collection persons with some shared and geometry refers collection specific kind intellectual between these poles realism and nominalism stand variety other positions but any ontology must give account which words refer which why and what categories some fundamental questions principal questions ontology what can said into what can sort existing what are the meanings what are the various modes being various philosophers have provided different answers these one common approach divide the extant subjects and predicates into groups called categories such lists categories differ widely from one and through the ordination different categorical schemes that ontology relates such fields library science and artificial intelligence such understanding ontological however merely taxonomic classificatory aristotle categories are the ways which being can addressed simply such what its quidditas how its how much where its relatedness other etc further examples ontological questions citation needed what existence what does mean for being existence property existence genus general class that simply divided specific which are are all entities how the properties object relate the object what features are the essential opposed merely accidental attributes given how many levels existence ontological levels are and what constitutes what physical object can one give account what means say that physical object can one give account what means say that physical entity what constitutes the identity when does object out opposed merely changing beings exist other than the modes objectivity and the object split modern philosophy concepts essential ontological dichotomies include universals and particulars substance and accident abstract and concrete objects essence and existence determinism and indeterminism types philosophers can classify ontologies various ways using criteria such the degree

needed the first occurrence english ontology recorded the oed oxford english online was work gideon harvey archelogia philosophica new principles containing philosophy metaphysicks dynamilogy discourse religio philosophi natural physicks natural philosophy london thomson citation needed likely the word was first used its latin form philosophers based the latin which themselves are based the citation needed origins parmenides and monism parmenides was among the first propose ontological characterization the fundamental nature his prologue proem describes two views existence initially that nothing comes from and therefore existence eternal consequently our opinions about truth must often false and most western philosophy including the fundamental concepts falsifiability have emerged from this this posits that existence what can conceived created hence there can neither void nor and true reality can neither come into being nor vanish from rather the entirety creation uniform and though not infinite characterized its shape that perfect parmenides thus posits that perceived everyday everything that can apprehended but one part single this idea somewhat anticipates the modern concept ultimate grand unification theory that finally describes all existence terms one related sub atomic reality which applies citation needed ontological pluralism ontological pluralism the opposite eleatic monism the pluralistic conception being the century anaxagoras and leucippus replaced the reality being unique and with that becoming and therefore more fundamental and elementary ontic plurality this thesis originated the hellenic stated two different ways anaxagoras and the first theory dealt with seeds which aristotle referred homeomeries the various the second was the atomistic which dealt with reality based the vacuum the atoms and their intrinsic movement citation needed the materialist atomism proposed leucippus was indeterminist but then developed democritus deterministic way was later century that the original atomism was taken again indeterministic epicurus confirmed the reality composed infinity unchangeable corpuscles atoms atomon lit but gives weight characterize atoms while for leucippus they are characterized figure order and position the they besides creating the whole with the intrinsic movement the vacuum producing the diverse flux their movement influenced the parenklisis lucretius names clinamen and that determined the chance these ideas foreshadowed our understanding traditional physics until the nature atoms was discovered the citation needed plato plato developed this distinction between true reality and arguing that what real are eternal and unchanging forms ideas precursor universals which things experienced sensation are best merely and real only far they copy partake such plato presumes that all nouns refer real whether sensible bodies insensible hence the sophist plato argues that being form which all existent things participate and which they have common though unclear whether intended the sense existence copula identity and against that forms must exist not only but also negation and being his categories aristotle identifies ten possible kinds things that can the subject the predicate for aristotle there are four different ontological citation needed according the various categories ways addressing being such according its truth falsity fake counterfeit whether exists and itself simply comes accident according its movement finished presence metaphysics book theta according avicenna and interpretation greek aristotelian and platonist ontological doctrines medieval metaphysics being either contingent qua possible necessary being that which cannot but since its being entails contingent qua possible being neither necessary nor impossible for not ontologically and brought from potential existing into actual existence way cause that external its its being borrowed unlike the necessary which subsisting and impossible for not for the necessarily does not and the affirmation its being other ontological topics ontological formations the concept ontological refers formations social relations understood dominant ways temporal spatial corporeal epistemological and performative relations are taken central understanding dominant that particular ontological formation based how ontological categories space embodiment knowing and performing are objectively and different ontological formations include the customary including the the the modern and the the concept was first introduced paul globalism nationalism tribalism and carried forward series writers including damian grenfell and manfred steger the engaged theory approach ontological formations are seen layered and intersecting rather than singular they are formations this approach avoids the usual problems great divide being posited between the modern and the ontological and epistemological certainty ren descartes with pense donc cogito ergo sum therefore argued that the something that can know exists with epistemological certainty descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead proof the certainty the existence god using the ontological argument that had been formulated first anselm canterbury citation needed certainty about the existence the and the however came under increasing criticism the sociological most notably george herbert mead and erving goffman saw the cartesian other generalized the imaginary audience that individuals use when thinking about the according not assume there self begin self not presupposed stuff out which the world rather the self arises the the cartesian other was also used sigmund freud who saw the superego abstract regulatory and mile durkheim who viewed this psychologically manifested entity which represented god society citation needed body and questioning the meaning being schools subjectivism objectivism and relativism existed various times the and the postmodernists and body philosophers tried reframe all these questions terms bodies taking some specific action this relied great degree insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action natural and artificial studied biology ecology and cognitive science citation needed the processes which bodies related environments became great and the idea being itself became difficult really what did people mean when they said must was some linguists advocated dropping the verb from the english leaving prime supposedly less prone bad others mostly tried dig into the word and its heidegger distinguished human being existence from the being things the heidegger proposes that our way being human and the way the world for are cast historically through fundamental ontological these fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication horizon unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background such human beings understood unquestioningly subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated everyday the locus our way being historical epoch the communicative event language for however communication the first place not among human but language itself shapes response questioning the inexhaustible meaning being even the focus traditional ontology the beings their standing presence can shifted pose the question the human being ontology and language some philosophers suggest that the question what least issue usage rather than question about this perspective conveyed analogy made donald davidson suppose person refers and makes some comments pertinent but uses the word consistently throughout instead one might readily catch that this person simply calls and the oddity analogously find people asserting there such and not ourselves think that exist might conclude that these people are not nuts davidson calls this assumption they simply use there differently than the question what least partially topic the philosophy and not entirely about ontology this viewpoint has been expressed eli hirsch hirsch interprets hilary putnam asserting that different concepts the existence can this position does not contradict the view that some things but points out that different will have different rules about assigning this how determine the the world then becomes subject for ontology and human geography human geography there are two types small which accounts for the practical describing functions being part the thought oversimplify and ignore key the other big systematically logically and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal this concept relates closely view that the human mind can only perceive bigger world they continue live within the confines their caves however spite the ontology relies the symbolic agreements among that ontology crucial for the axiomatic language reality and actuality according whitehead for useful distinguish the terms and this actual has philosophical status fundamental ontological while real one which may may derive its reality from its logical relation some actual entity for occasion the life socrates actual but being man does not make actual because refers indeterminately many actual such several occasions the life and also several occasions the lives and but the notion man derives its reality from its reference those many actual each which actual actual occasion concrete while terms such are abstractions from many concrete relevant according actual entity must earn its philosophical status fundamental ontological priority satisfying several philosophical there going behind actual find something more fundamental fact this criterion regarded expressing postulated distinguished actual entity must completely determinate the sense that there can confusion about its identity that would allow confounded with another actual this sense actual entity completely with potential something other than what course source potentiality for the creation other actual which may said part likewise the concretion realization potentialities other actual entities which are its partial causation between actual entities essential their consequently for each actual entity has its distinct and definite extension physical minkowski space and uniquely description minkowski space supports descriptions time and space for particular part the aim the philosophy such ontology that the actual entities should all qua actual they should all satisfy single definite set well stated ontological criteria whitehead proposed that his notion occasion experience satisfies the criteria for its status the philosophically preferred definition actual from purely logical point each occasion experience has full measure the characters both objective and subjective subjectivity and objectivity refer different aspects occasion and way they exclude each examples other philosophical proposals candidates actual this are leibniz monads and descartes res and the more modern states aristotle such have behind them more fundamental the primary and this sense not satisfy whitehead not happy with monads actual entities because they are windowless and not cause each states are often not closely often without specific mention extension physical minkowski they are therefore not necessarily processes but may their name simply static states some states affairs are contingent and are therefore have something behind one summary the whiteheadian actual entity that process another referring its causal linkage other actual that all contrast with windowless this view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities really but not fundamentally and primarily factual causally they have existence with reality only derived from their reference actual whiteheadian actual entity has unique and completely definite place and whiteheadian abstractions are not tightly defined time and and the some are timeless and entities all abstractions have logical conceptual rather than efficacious their lack definite time does not make them unreal they refer actual whitehead calls this the ontological prominent ontologists anselm canterbury thomas aquinas aristotle david malet armstrong alain badiou gustav bergmann bernard
