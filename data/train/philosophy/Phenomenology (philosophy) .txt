phenomenology navigation search phenomenography phenomenology phenomenology from greek phain menon that which and gos study the philosophical study the structures experience and philosophical movement was founded the early years the century edmund husserl and was later expanded upon circle his followers the universities ttingen and munich germany then spread france the united states and often contexts far removed from early phenomenology primarily concerned with the systematic reflection and study the structures consciousness and the phenomena that appear acts this ontology study can clearly differentiated from the cartesian method analysis which sees the world sets and objects acting and reacting upon one husserl conception phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only

identify its roots the philosophy immanuel kant his critique pure reason kant distinguished between phenomena objects interpreted human sensibility and and noumena objects things themselves which humans cannot directly according century kantianism operated two broad structural linguistics and hicks the structuralists were seeking subjective noumenal and the phenomenologists were content with describing the phenomena without asking what connection external reality those experiences might its most basic phenomenology thus attempts create conditions for the objective study topics usually regarded subjective consciousness and the content conscious experiences such judgments perceptions and emotions although phenomenology seeks does not attempt study consciousness from the perspective clinical psychology instead seeks through systematic reflection determine the essential properties and structures citation needed there are several assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its first rejects the concept objective phenomenologists prefer grouping assumptions through process called phenomenological second phenomenology believes that analyzing daily human behavior can provide one with greater understanding the third assumption that not should this because persons can understood through the unique ways they reflect the society they live fourth phenomenologists prefer gather conscious rather than traditional finally phenomenology considered oriented and therefore phenomenologists gather research using methods that are far less restricting than other husserl derived many important concepts central phenomenology from the works and lectures his the philosophers and psychologists franz brentano and carl stumpf important element phenomenology that husserl borrowed from brentano intentionality often described aboutness the notion that consciousness always consciousness something the object consciousness called the intentional object and this object constituted for consciousness many different through for perception memory retention and protention signification etc throughout these different though they have different structures and different ways being about the object still constituted the identical consciousness directed the same intentional object direct perception the immediately following retention this object and the eventual remembering though many the phenomenological methods involve various phenomenology anti reductionistic the reductions are mere tools better understand and describe the workings not reduce any phenomenon these other when reference made essence idea when one details the constitution identical coherent thing describing what one really sees being only these sides and these does not mean that the thing only and exclusively what described the ultimate goal these reductions understand how these different aspects are constituted into the actual thing experienced the person experiencing phenomenology direct reaction the psychologism and physicalism citation needed although previously employed hegel his phenomenology spirit was adoption this term circa that propelled into becoming the designation philosophical philosophical phenomenology its though the specific meaning the term varies according how conceived given envisioned phenomenology method philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated western thought since plato favor method reflective attentiveness that discloses the lived loosely rooted epistemological with sceptic roots called epoch husserl method entails the suspension judgment while relying the intuitive grasp free presuppositions and sometimes depicted the science the phenomenological method rooted husserl theory consciousness developed from intentionality represents alternative the representational theory which holds that reality cannot grasped directly because available only through perceptions reality that are representations the husserl countered that consciousness not the mind but rather conscious something other than itself the intentional whether the object substance figment imagination the real processes associated with and underlying the hence the phenomenological method relies the description phenomena they are given their immediacy according maurice natanson the radicality the phenomenological method both continuous and discontinuous with general effort subject experience critical take nothing for granted and show the warranty for what claim entails unusual combination discipline and detachment theoretical explanations and hand information while determining experience the the phenomenological method serves momentarily erase the world speculation returning the subject his her primordial experience the whether the object inquiry according husserl the suspension belief what ordinarily take for granted infer conjecture diminishes the power what customarily embrace objective according diger safranski husserl and his great ambition was disregard anything that had until then been thought said about consciousness the world the lookout for new way letting the things they approach without covering them with what they already martin heidegger modified conception phenomenology because what heidegger perceived husserl subjectivist whereas husserl conceived humans having been constituted states heidegger countered that consciousness peripheral the primacy existence the mode being dasein which cannot reduced consciousness from this one state mind rather than determinant including those aspects existence that one not conscious shifting the center gravity from consciousness existence heidegger altered the subsequent direction one consequence modification phenomenology became increasingly relevant psychoanalysis whereas husserl gave priority depiction consciousness that was fundamentally alien the psychoanalytic conception the heidegger offered way conceptualize experience that could accommodate those aspects existence that lie the periphery sentient historical overview the use the term phenomenology has least two main meanings philosophical history one the writings hegel another the writings edmund husserl and deriving from the writings his former research assistant martin heidegger for hegel phenomenology approach philosophy that begins with exploration phenomena what presents itself conscious means finally grasp the logical ontological and metaphysical spirit that behind this has been called dialectical phenomenology for edmund husserl phenomenology the reflective study the essence consciousness experienced from the person point phenomenology takes the intuitive experience phenomena what presents itself phenomenological its starting point and tries extract from the essential features experiences and the essence what when generalized the essential features any possible this has been called transcendental phenomenology husserl view was based aspects the work franz brentano and was developed further philosophers such maurice ponty max scheler edith stein dietrich von hildebrand and emmanuel levinas although the term phenomenology was used occasionally the history philosophy before husserl modern use ties more explicitly his particular following list thinkers rough chronological order who used the term phenomenology variety with brief comments their friedrich christoph oetinger german pietist for the study the divine system johann heinrich lambert mathematician physician and philosopher known for the theory appearances underlying empirical immanuel kant the critique pure reason distinguished between objects phenomena which are objects shaped and grasped human sensibility and and objects things themselves noumena which not appear space and time and about which can make legitimate hegel challenged doctrine the unknowable and declared that knowing phenomena more fully can gradually arrive consciousness the absolute and spiritual truth most notably his phenomenology spirit published carl stumpf student brentano and mentor used phenomenology refer ontology sensory citation needed edmund husserl established phenomenology first kind descriptive and later transcendental and eidetic science considered the founder contemporary max scheler developed further the phenomenological method edmund husserl and extended include also reduction the scientific method influenced the thinking pope john paul dietrich von hildebrand and edith stein martin heidegger criticized theory phenomenology and attempted develop theory ontology that led him his original theory dasein the dualistic human alfred developed phenomenology the social world the basis everyday experience that has influenced major sociologists such harold garfinkel peter berger and thomas luckmann francisco varela chilean philosopher and developed the basis for experimental phenomenology and werner erhard born uses the phenomenological methodology provide actionable access being leader and the effective exercise later usage mostly based related introduction and use the this branch philosophy differs from others that tends more descriptive than prescriptive phenomenological terminology intentionality intentionality refers the notion that consciousness always the consciousness something the word itself should not confused with the ordinary use the word but should rather taken playing the etymological roots the originally intention referred stretching lat intendere and this context refers consciousness stretching out towards its object although one should careful with this seeing there not some consciousness first subsequently stretches out its rather consciousness occurs the simultaneity conscious act and its intentionality often summed whether this something that consciousness about direct perception fantasy inconsequential the concept intentionality whatever consciousness directed that what consciousness conscious this means that the object consciousness have physical object apprehended perception can just well fantasy consequently these structures perception memory fantasy etc are called intentionalities the cardinal principle the term intentionality originated with the scholastics the medieval period and was resurrected brentano who turn influenced conception who refined the term and made the cornerstone his theory the meaning the term complex and depends entirely how conceived given the term should not confused with the psychoanalytic conception unconscious intuition intuition phenomenology refers those cases where the intentional object directly present the intentionality the intention filled the direct apprehension the you have intuited having cup coffee front for seeing feeling even imagining these are all filled and the object then intuited the same goes for the apprehension mathematical formulae you not have the object referred the object not but still but then emptily examples empty intentions can signitive intentions intentions that only imply refer their citation needed evidence everyday use the word evidence signify special sort relation between state affairs and state evidence for the proposition however the concept evidence meant signify the subjective achievement this not attempt reduce the objective sort evidence subjective but rather attempt describe the structure having something present intuition with the addition having present intelligible evidence the successful presentation intelligible the successful presentation something whose truth becomes manifest the evidencing noesis and noema noema which quite this pair derived from the greek nous designate respectively the real noesis and the ideal noema intentional act act the noesis the part the act that gives particular sense character judging perceiving loving hating accepting rejecting and this real the sense that actually part what takes place the consciousness the subject the the noesis always correlated with noema for the full noema complex ideal structure comprising least noematic sense and noematic the correct interpretation what husserl meant the noema has long been but the noematic sense generally understood the ideal meaning the act and the noematic core the referent object meant the act one element controversy whether this noematic object the same the actual object the act assuming some kind ideal empathy and intersubjectivity empathy intersubjectivity empathy refers the experience own body another while often identify others with their physical this type phenomenology requires that focus the subjectivity the well our intersubjective engagement with original this was done sort apperception built the experiences your own the lived body your own body experienced yourself your own body manifests itself you mainly your possibilities acting the what lets you reach out and grab for but and more allows for the possibility changing your point this helps you differentiate one thing from another the experience moving around seeing new aspects often referred making the absent present and the present and still retaining the notion that this the same thing that you saw other aspects just moment ago your body also experienced both object you can touch your own and your own subjectivity you experience being the experience your own body your own subjectivity then applied the experience which through constituted another you can thus recognise the emotions etc this experience empathy important the phenomenological account intersubjectivity intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity what you experience objective experienced being intersubjectively available available all other this does not imply that objectivity reduced subjectivity nor does imply relativist for instance intersubjective verifiability the experience one also experiences oneself being subject among other and one experiences oneself existing objectively for these others one experiences oneself the noema noeses subject empathic one experiences oneself objectively existing intersubjectivity also part the constitution especially lifeworld lifeworld the lifeworld lebenswelt the world each one lives one could call the background horizon all and that which each object stands out itself and with the meaning can only hold for the lifeworld both personal and intersubjective then called homeworld and does not enclose each one solus ipse husserl logische untersuchungen

dietrich von hildebrand existential phenomenology existential phenomenology existential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology its rejection the transcendental merleau ponty objects the transcendence the which for husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the heidegger thinks conscious being always already the transcendence maintained existential phenomenology the extent that the method phenomenology must take presuppositionless starting point transcending claims about the world arising for natural scientific attitudes theories the ontological nature the while husserl thought philosophy scientific discipline that had founded phenomenology understood epistemology heidegger held radically different heidegger himself states their differences this for the phenomenological reduction the method leading phenomenological vision from the natural attitude the human being whose life involved the world things and persons back the transcendental life consciousness and its noematic which objects are constituted correlates for phenomenological reduction means leading phenomenological vision back from the apprehension whatever may the character that the understanding the being this being projecting upon the way according philosophy was not all scientific but more fundamental than science according him science only one way knowing the world with special access furthermore the scientific mindset itself built much more primordial foundation everyday husserl was skeptical this which regarded and contributed the divergence their instead taking phenomenology prima philosophia foundational heidegger took metaphysical being the proper and sole theme philosophy this means that philosophy not science beings but yet confuse phenomenology and ontology obvious phenomena are not the foundation ground neither are they for heidegger argues being and time appearance that which shows itself something while phenomenon that which shows itself while for the being appeared only correlate for heidegger being the starting while for husserl would have abstract from all concrete determinations our empirical able turn the field pure heidegger claims that the possibilities and destinies philosophy are bound with and thus with temporality and with however ontological being and existential being are different conflation these categories according the root husserl charged heidegger with raising the question ontology but failing answer instead switching the topic the the only being for whom being that neither ontology nor according but merely abstract perhaps abstract existentialist searching for husserl rejected the existentialism implicit distinction between being things reality and being the encounter with when being becomes present that existential phenomenologists martin heidegger hannah arendt emmanuel levinas gabriel marcel jean paul sartre paul ricoeur and maurice ponty eastern thought some researchers phenomenology particular reference heidegger see possibilities establishing dialogues with traditions thought outside the called western philosophy particularly with respect east asian thinking and despite perceived differences between eastern and western furthermore has been claimed that number elements within phenomenology mainly have some resonance with eastern philosophical particularly with zen buddhism and taoism according tomonubu imamichi the concept dasein was inspired although heidegger remained silent this okakura kakuzo concept das sein being the expressed the book tea describe zhuangzi which teacher had offered heidegger after having studied with him the year there are also recent signs the reception phenomenology and thought within scholarly circles focused studying the impetus metaphysics the history ideas islam and early islamic philosophy perhaps under the indirect influence the tradition the french orientalist and philosopher henri corbin the work jim ruddy the field comparative combined the concept transcendental ego phenomenology with the concept the primacy consciousness the work the course this ruddy uncovered wholly new eidetic phenomenological which called convergent this new phenomenology takes over where husserl left and deals with the constitution rather than merely intentional objectivity technoethics phenomenological approach technology james moor has argued that computers show policy vacuums that require new thinking and the establishment new others have argued that the resources provided classical ethical theory such utilitarianism consequentialism and deontological ethics more than enough deal with all the ethical issues emerging from our design and use information for the phenomenologist the impact technology well the constructivist view the society relationships valid but not adequate heidegger borgmann winograd and flores ihde dreyfus they argue that these accounts and the technology society relationship posit technology and society speaking about the one does not immediately and already draw upon the other for its ongoing sense for the society and technology constitute each they are each ongoing possibility for being what they for them technology not just the rather the artifact already emerges from prior attitude towards the world heidegger heidegger approach technological for heidegger the essence technology the way being modern way conducting themselves towards the that sees the world something ordered and shaped line with intentions and will that manifests itself will heidegger claims that there were other times human modern where humans did not orient themselves towards the world technological simply resources for our however according heidegger this age one where relation with the world and their way being was poetic and aesthetic rather than technological there are many who disagree with account the modern technological attitude the the for example andrew feenberg argues that account modern technology not borne out contemporary everyday encounters with technology the hubert dreyfus approach contemporary critiquing the artificial intelligence programme hubert dreyfus argues that the way skill development has become understood the past has been this the model that the early artificial intelligence community uncritically opposition this view with that what observe when learn new skill everyday practice fact the most often start with explicit rules preformulated approaches and then move multiplicity particular become his argument draws directly account being and time humans beings that are always already situated humans are already experts going about everyday dealing with the subtleties every particular that why everyday life seems thus the intricate expertise everyday activity forgotten and taken for granted assumed starting what dreyfus highlighted his critique was the fact that technology does not make sense the and horizon everyday practice that make technological devices and solutions show are understand technology need the horizon meaning that made show the artifacts want and also need consider how these technologies reveal see also
