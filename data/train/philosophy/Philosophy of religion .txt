what christianity judaism hinduism islam buddhism shinto sikhism bahai jainism among theists some believe there just one god monotheism while others believe many gods polytheism some hindus have widely followed monistic philosophy that can said neither monotheistic nor polytheistic within these two broad categories monotheism and there wide variety possible for among the monotheists deists believe that the one god like watchmaker who wound the universe and does not intervene further the and some theists believe that god continues active the ignostics object that coherent definition god must presented before the question the existence god can meaningfully rationality belief existence god positions the second have any good reason think that god does does not equally important the philosophy there are several main positions with regard the existence god that one might theism the belief the existence one more divinities pantheism the belief that god exists all things the that god one and all god panentheism the belief that god encompasses all things the cosmos but that god greater than the god both immanent and deism the belief that god does exist but does not interfere with human life and the laws the god monotheism the belief that single deity exists which rules the universe separate and individual polytheism the belief that multiple deities exist which rule the universe separate and individual henotheism the belief that multiple deities may may not though there single supreme henology believing that multiple avatars deity which represent unique aspects the ultimate agnosticism the belief that the existence existence deities god currently unknown unknowable and cannot weaker form this might defined simply lack certainty about existence citation needed atheism the rejection belief the existence deities strong atheism specifically the position that there are deities weak atheism simply the absence belief that any deities apatheism the lack caring whether any supreme being lack thereof possibilianism these are not mutually exclusive for agnostic theists choose believe god exists while asserting that knowledge existence inherently similarly agnostic atheists reject belief the existence all while asserting that whether any such entities exist not inherently natural theology the attempt provide proofs arguments for the existence god one aspect what known natural theology the natural theistic project this strand natural theology attempts justify belief god independent there plenty philosophical literature faith especially fideism and other subjects generally considered outside the realm natural perhaps most philosophy religion predicated natural assumption that the existence god can justified warranted rational there has been considerable philosophical and theological debate about the kinds justifications and arguments that are appropriate for this the philosopher alvin plantinga has shifted his focus justifying belief god that those who believe for whatever are rational doing through reformed epistemology the context theory warrant and proper cognitive other reactions natural theology are those wittgensteinian philosophers most notably phillips phillips rejects natural and its evidentialist approach favor grammatical approach which investigates the meaning belief for belief god not proposition with particular truth value but form consequently the question whether god exists confuses the logical categories which govern theistic language with those that govern other forms discourse most scientific according the question whether not god exists cannot objectively answered philosophy because the categories truth and which are necessary for asking the have application the religious contexts wherein religious belief has its sense and other the question cannot answered because cannot asked without entering into phillips sees the job the philosopher not investigate the rationality belief god but elucidate its analytic philosophy religion analytic philosophy religion harris noted that analytic philosophy has been very heterogeneous some forms analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic the philosophy religion and have actually provided philosophical mechanism for responding other more radical and hostile forms analytic with the study early analytic philosophy tended avoid the study philosophy largely dismissing per the logical positivists the subject part metaphysics and therefore the collapse logical positivism renewed interest philosophy prompting philosophers like william alston john mackie alvin robert merrihew adams richard and antony flew not only introduce new but open classical topics such the nature miracles theistic the problem see existence god the rationality belief god concepts the nature and many plantinga mackie and flew debated the logical validity the free will defense way solve the problem alston grappling with the consequences analytic philosophy worked the nature religious adams worked the relationship faith and analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for number sophisticated theistic like those the reformed epistemologists like analytic philosophy religion has also been preoccupied with ludwig wittgenstein well his interpretation ren kierkegaard philosophy using hand remarks which would later published philosophical investigations culture and value and other philosophers such peter winch and norman malcolm developed what has come known contemplative philosophy wittgensteinian school thought rooted the swansea and which includes wittgensteinians such rush rhees peter winch and phillips among the name contemplative was first coined phillips philosophy cool place which rests interpretation passage from culture and this interpretation was first wittgensteinian kai nielsen but those who consider themselves wittgensteinians the swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal caricature considered this especially true phillips responding this kai nielsen and phillips became two the most prominent philosophers philosophy the problem discussing religion religion difficult

contradiction meaning that such belief either real due the that there cannot middle ground between the two possibilities existence versus this means that supernatural all powerful deities can only
