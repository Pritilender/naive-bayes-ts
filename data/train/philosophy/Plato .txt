very limited the philosopher came from one the wealthiest and most politically active families ancient sources describe him bright though modest boy who excelled his his father contributed all which was necessary give his son good and therefore plato must have been instructed music gymnastics and philosophy some the most distinguished teachers his birth and family the exact time and place birth are not but certain that belonged aristocratic and influential based ancient most modern scholars believe that was born athens aegina between and his father was ariston according disputed reported diogenes laertius ariston traced his descent from the king athens codrus and the king messenia melanthus plato mother was perictione whose family boasted relationship with the famous athenian lawmaker and lyric poet solon perictione was sister charmides and niece critias both prominent figures the thirty tyrants the brief oligarchic regime which followed the collapse athens the end the peloponnesian war besides plato ariston and perictione had three other these were two adeimantus and glaucon and daughter potone the mother speusippus the nephew and successor plato head his philosophical according the republic adeimantus and glaucon were older than nevertheless his memorabilia xenophon presents glaucon younger than the traditional date birth based dubious interpretation diogenes who when was joined cratylus the heracleitean and who philosophized the manner then hermodorus went euclides debra nails the text itself gives reason infer that plato left immediately for megara and implies the very his seventh letter plato notes that his coming age coincided with the taking power the remarking but youth under the age twenty made himself laughingstock attempted enter the political thus nails dates birth according some ariston tried force his attentions but failed his then the god apollo appeared him and ariston left perictione another legend related when plato was bees settled his lips while was augury the sweetness style which would discourse about ariston appears have died although the precise dating his death perictione then married pyrilampes her who had served many times ambassador the persian court and was friend pericles the leader the democratic faction pyrilampes had son from previous demus who was famous for his perictione gave birth second antiphon the brother who appears parmenides contrast his reticence about plato often introduced his distinguished relatives into his referred them with some charmides has dialogue named after critias speaks both charmides and protagoras and adeimantus and glaucon take prominent parts the republic these and other references suggest considerable amount family pride and enable reconstruct family tree according the opening scene the charmides glorification the whole connection plato dialogues are not only memorial but also the happier days his own name according diogenes rtius the philosopher was named aristocles after his but his wrestling coach ariston dubbed him platon meaning account his robust according the sources mentioned diogenes all dating from the alexandrian period plato derived his name from the breadth platyt his else because was very wide plat across the recent scholars have argued that the legend about his name being aristocles originated the hellenistic age plato was common which instances are known athens education apuleius informs that speusippus praised quickness mind and modesty and the first fruits his youth infused with hard work and love plato must have been instructed music and gymnastics the most distinguished teachers his dicaearchus went far say that plato wrestled the isthmian games plato had also attended courses before meeting first became acquainted with cratylus disciple heraclitus prominent pre socratic greek and the heraclitean borody argues that athenian openness towards wider range sexuality may have contributed the athenian openness towards wider range cultural situation borody describes polymorphously plato and socrates socratic problem socrates the precise relationship between plato and socrates remains area contention among plato makes clear his apology socrates that was devoted young follower that socrates presented mentioning plato name one those youths close enough him have been were fact guilty corrupting the and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward testify against him was indeed guilty such crime later plato mentioned along with critobolus and apollodorus offering pay fine minas behalf lieu the death penalty proposed meletus the phaedo the title character lists those who were attendance the prison last explaining absence plato was phaedo plato never speaks his own voice his the second letter writing plato exists ever will but those now said his are those socrates become beautiful and the letter the final qualification seems call into question the historical any xenophon and aristophanes seem present somewhat different portrait socrates from the one plato some have called attention the problem taking socrates his given reputation for irony and the dramatic nature the dialogue aristotle attributes different doctrine with respect the ideas plato and socrates metaphysics putting aristotle merely suggests that idea forms can discovered through investigation the natural unlike forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range human later life plato may have traveled italy sicily egypt and cyrene libya said have returned athens the age plato founded one the earliest known organized schools western civilization plot land the grove hecademus the academy was large enclosure ground about six stadia outside athens one story that the name the academy comes from the ancient academus another story that the name came from supposed former citizen athens also named academus yet another account that was named after member the army castor and pollux arcadian named the academy operated until was destroyed lucius cornelius sulla neoplatonists revived the academy the early and operated until when was closed justinian byzantium who saw threat the propagation christianity many intellectuals were schooled the the most prominent one being throughout his later plato became entangled with the politics the city syracuse according diogenes plato initially visited syracuse while was under the rule dionysius during this first trip dion syracuse became one but the tyrant himself turned against plato was sold into slavery and almost faced death city war with before admirer bought freedom and sent him after according plato seventh letter dion requested plato return syracuse tutor dionysius and guide him become philosopher dionysius seemed accept but became suspicious his dionysius expelled dion and kept plato against his eventually plato left dion would return overthrow dionysius and ruled syracuse for short time before being usurped calippus fellow disciple death variety sources have given accounts one based mutilated suggests plato died his whilst young thracian girl played the flute another tradition suggests plato died wedding the account based diogenes reference account century according tertullian plato simply died his philosophy the school athens raphael nicomachean ethics timaeus the forms recurrent themes plato often discusses the son relationship and the question whether interest his sons has much with how well his sons turn boy ancient athens was socially located his family and plato often refers his characters terms their paternal and fraternal socrates was not family and saw himself the son his who was apparently divine socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees tutors and trainers for their and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character gift from the crito reminds socrates that orphans are the mercy but socrates the theaetetus found recruiting disciple young man whose inheritance has been socrates twice compares the relationship the older man and his boy lover the son relationship lysis republic and the phaedo socrates disciples towards whom displays more concern than his biological say they will feel fatherless when several socrates floats the idea that knowledge matter and not observation maintains this view somewhat his own because many socrates complains his socrates often found arguing that knowledge not and that comes from divine many middle period such the phaedo republic and phaedrus plato advocates belief the immortality the and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the afterlife more than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and perception and reality nature and and body and several dialogues tackle questions about socrates says that poetry inspired the muses and not speaks approvingly and other forms divine madness eroticism and the phaedrus and yet the republic wants outlaw great and laughter ion socrates gives hint the disapproval homer that expresses the republic the dialogue ion suggests that homer iliad functioned the ancient greek world the bible does today the modern christian divinely inspired literature that can provide moral only can properly socrates and his company disputants had something say many including politics and religion and justice and virtue and crime and pleasure and rhetoric and human nature and well love and metaphysics platonic realism platonism term coined scholars refer the intellectual consequences socrates often the reality the material several most notably the republic socrates inverts the common intuition about what knowable and what while most people take the objects their senses real anything socrates contemptuous people who think that something has graspable the hands the theaetetus says such people are expression that means happily without the theaetetus other such people live without the divine inspiration that gives and people like access higher insights about socrates idea that reality unavailable those who use their senses what puts him odds with the common and with common socrates says that who sees with his eyes and this idea most famously captured his allegory the cave and more explicitly his description the divided line the allegory the cave begins republic paradoxical analogy wherein socrates argues that the invisible world the most intelligible noeton and that the visible world the least and the most socrates says the republic that people who take the lit world the senses good and real are living pitifully den evil and socrates admits that few climb out the cave and those who not only have terrible struggle attain the but when they back down for visit help other people they find themselves objects scorn and according physical objects and physical events are shadows their ideal perfect and exist only the extent that they instantiate the perfect versions just shadows are inconsequential epiphenomena produced physical physical objects are themselves fleeting phenomena caused more substantial the ideals which they are mere for socrates thinks that perfect justice exists although not clear and his own trial would cheap copy the allegory the cave often said scholars represent own epistemology and intimately connected his political ideology often said also that only people who have climbed out the cave and cast their eyes vision goodness are fit socrates claims that the enlightened men society must forced from their divine contemplations and compelled run the city according their lofty thus born the idea the philosopher king the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him the people who are wise enough choose good this the main thesis socrates the republic that the most wisdom the masses can muster the wise choice theory forms theory forms the theory forms theory typically refers the belief that the material world seems not the real but only image copy the real some this expressed who spoke forms formulating solution the problem universals the according are archetypes abstract representations the many types and properties feel and see around that can only perceived reason greek that they are universals other socrates was able recognize two the apparent which constantly and unchanging and unseen world which may the cause what epistemology platonic epistemology many have interpreted plato even having been the first that knowledge justified true belief influential view that informed future developments this interpretation partly based reading the theaetetus wherein plato argues that knowledge distinguished from mere true belief the knower having account the object her his true belief theaetetus and this theory may again seen the meno where suggested that true belief can raised the level knowledge bound with account the question why the object the true belief meno many years edmund gettier famously demonstrated the problems the justified true belief account that the modern theory justified true belief knowledge which gettier addresses equivalent accepted some scholars but rejected plato himself also identified problems with the justified true belief definition the theaetetus concluding that justification account would require knowledge differentness meaning that the definition knowledge circular theaetetus later the meno socrates uses geometrical example expound view that knowledge this latter sense acquired recollection socrates elicits fact concerning geometrical construction from slave who could not have otherwise known the fact due the slave lack the knowledge must socrates non experiential other the sophist statesman republic and the parmenides plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension unchanging forms and their relationships one another which calls expertise dialectic including through the processes collection and division more plato himself argues the timaeus that knowledge always proportionate the realm from which other one derives account something because the world sense the views therein attained will mere and opinions are characterized lack necessity and the other one derives account something way the sensible because these forms are too the account derived from that apprehension forms required for knowledge may taken cohere with theory the theaetetus and meno indeed the apprehension forms may the base the account required for that offers foundational knowledge which itself needs thereby avoiding infinite regression the state the republic papirus oxyrhynchus republic philosophical views had many societal especially the idea ideal state there some discrepancy between his early and later some the most famous doctrines are contained the republic during his middle well the laws and the statesman however because plato wrote assumed that socrates often speaking for this assumption may not true all plato through the words asserts that societies have tripartite class structure corresponding the reason structure the individual the reason are analogous the castes productive the carpenters plumbers masons merchants farmers ranchers etc these correspond the appetite part the protective warriors those who are strong and the armed these correspond the spirit part the governing rulers philosopher those who are rational self love with well suited make decisions for the these correspond the reason part the soul and are very the timaeus plato locates the parts the soul within the human reason located the spirit the top third the torso and the appetite the middle third the down the navel according this the principles athenian democracy existed his are rejected only few are fit instead rhetoric and plato says reason and wisdom should plato puts republic plato describes these philosopher those who love the sight republic and supports the idea with the analogy captain and his ship doctor and his according sailing and health are not things that everyone qualified practice large part the republic then addresses how the educational system should set produce these philosopher however must taken into account that the ideal city outlined the republic qualified socrates the ideal luxurious city examined determine how that injustice and justice grow city republic according the true and healthy city instead the one first outlined book the republic containing craftsmen merchants and but lacking the guardian class kings well delicacies such perfumed incense prostitutes and addition gold ivory couches multitude occupations such poets and and the ideal city used image illuminate the state the will reason and desires combined the human socrates attempting make image rightly ordered and then later goes describe the different kinds humans that can from tyrants lovers money various kinds the ideal city not but only used magnify the different kinds individual humans and the state their however the philosopher king image was used many after plato justify their personal political the philosophic soul according socrates has will and desires united virtuous philosopher has the moderate love for wisdom and the courage act according wisdom knowledge about the good the right relations between all that exists wherein concerns states and plato has made interesting for instance asks which bad democracy country reigned argues that better ruled bad than bad democracy since here all the people are now responsible for such rather than one individual committing many bad this emphasised within the republic plato describes the event mutiny board plato suggests the ships crew line with the democratic rule many and the although inhibited through the plato description this event parallel that democracy within the state and the inherent problems that according state made different kinds souls overall decline from aristocracy rule the timocracy rule the then oligarchy rule the then democracy rule the and finally tyranny rule one rule aristocracy the form government politeia advocated republic this regime ruled philosopher and thus grounded wisdom and the aristocratic and the man whose nature corresponds are the objects analyses throughout much the republic opposed the other four types who are discussed later his book plato states order the other four imperfect societies with description the structure and individual timocracy the ruling class made primarily those with like his plato has sparta oligarchy made society which wealth the criterion merit and the wealthy are the state bears resemblance ancient athens with traits such equality political opportunity and freedom for the individual democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict rich and characterized undisciplined society existing where the tyrant rises popular champion leading the formation his private army and the growth unwritten doctrines for long plato unwritten doctrine had been many modern books plato seem diminish its nevertheless the first important witness who mentions its existence who his physics writes indeed that the account gives there timaeus the participant different from what says his called unwritten teachings the term literally means unwritten doctrines and stands for the most fundamental metaphysical teaching which disclosed only and some say only his most trusted and which may have kept secret from the the importance the unwritten doctrines does not seem have been seriously questioned before the reason for not revealing everyone partially discussed phaedrus where plato criticizes the written transmission knowledge favoring instead the spoken logos who has knowledge the just and the good and beautiful will when write them sowing them through pen with which cannot defend themselves argument and cannot teach the truth the same argument repeated seventh letter every serious man dealing with really serious subjects carefully avoids the same letter writes can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim know the subjects that seriously study there does not nor will there ever any treatise mine dealing such secrecy necessary order not expose them unseemly and degrading however said that plato once disclosed this knowledge the public his lecture the good which the good identified with the one the the fundamental ontological the content this lecture has been transmitted several aristoxenus describes the event the following each came expecting learn something about the things that are generally considered good for such good physical and altogether kind wonderful but when the mathematical demonstrations including geometrical figures and and finally the statement good one seemed utterly unexpected and hence some belittled the while others rejected simplicius quotes alexander aphrodisias who states that according the first principles including the forms themselves are one and indefinite duality which called large and small and simplicius reports well that one might also learn this from speusippus and xenocrates and the others who were present lecture the their account full agreement with description metaphysical metaphysics now since the forms are the causes everything plato supposed that their elements are the elements all accordingly the material principle the great and small the and the essence the one since the numbers are derived from the great and small participation the from this account clear that only employed two that the and the material for the forms are the cause the essence everything and the one the cause the also tells what the material substrate which the forms are predicated the case sensible and the one that the forms that this the duality the the great and small further assigned these two elements respectively the causation good and the most important aspect this interpretation metaphysics the continuity between his teaching and the neoplatonic interpretation plotinus ficino which has been considered erroneous many but may fact have been directly influenced oral transmission modern scholar who recognized the importance the unwritten doctrine plato was heinrich gomperz who described his speech during the international congress philosophy all the sources related the have been collected konrad gaiser and published testimonia platonica these sources have subsequently been interpreted scholars from the german bingen school interpretation such hans joachim mer thomas szlez dialectic the role dialectic thought contested but there are two main type reasoning and method simon blackburn adopts the saying that dialectic the process eliciting the truth means questions aimed opening out what already implicitly exposing the contradictions and muddles similar interpretation has been put forth louis who suggests that elements the dialectic are borrowed from hegel according this opposing arguments improve upon each and prevailing opinion shaped the synthesis many conflicting ideas over each new idea exposes flaw the accepted and the epistemological substance the debate continually approaches the hartz teleological interpretation the which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body knowledge and thus reach the end karl the other claims that dialectic the art intuition for visualising the divine the forms unveiling the great mystery behind the common everyday world the dialogues six dialogues and thirteen letters have traditionally been ascribed though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity least some plato writings have been published several this has led several conventions regarding the naming and referencing the usual system for making unique references sections the text plato derives from century edition works henricus stephanus overview writings according

established with any though works are still often characterized falling least roughly into three the following represents one relatively common such however kept mind that many the positions the

are considered the most faithful representations the historical they include the apology socrates charmides crito euthyphro ion laches lesser hippias lysis menexenus and protagoras often considered

positive teachings that are often ascribed plato such the theory these dialogues include cratylus phaedo phaedrus republic symposium parmenides and theaetetus proponents dividing the dialogues into periods often consider the parmenides and theaetetus come late this period and transitional the they seem treat the theory forms critically parmenides not all theaetetus the first book the republic often thought have been written significantly earlier than the rest the although possibly having undergone revisions when the later books were attached the remaining dialogues are classified late and are generally agreed difficult and challenging pieces this grouping the only one proven stylometric while looked for mature answers the questions posed his earlier those answers are difficult some

against charges disbelief the gods and corruption the socrates insists that standing slander will the real cause his and says the legal charges are essentially socrates famously denies being and explains how his life philosopher was launched the oracle delphi says that his quest resolve the riddle the oracle put him odds with his fellow and that this the reason has been mistaken for menace

specifically the apology whom also slyly jabs the cratylus for charging the hefty fee fifty drachmas for course language and however socrates tells theaetetus his namesake dialogue that admires prodicus and has directed many pupils socrates ideas are also not consistent within between among platonic scholarship process and reality although their popularity has fluctuated over the the works plato have never been without readers since the time they were plato thought often compared with that his most famous aristotle whose reputation during the western middle ages completely eclipsed that plato that the scholastic philosophers referred aristotle the however the byzantine empire the study plato the medieval scholastic philosophers did not have access most the works nor the knowledge greek needed read plato original writings were essentially lost western civilization until they were brought from constantinople the century its george gemistos plethon believed that plethon passed copy the dialogues cosimo medici when the council called unify the greek and latin was adjourned where plethon then lectured the relation and differences plato and and fired cosimo with his during the early islamic persian and arab scholars translated much plato into arabic and wrote commentaries and interpretations aristotle and other platonist works see farabi avicenna averroes hunayn ibn ishaq many these comments plato were translated from arabic into latin and such influenced medieval scholastic only the renaissance with the general resurgence interest classical did knowledge philosophy become widespread again the many the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with scholasticism and fostered the flowering the with the support the inspired lorenzo medici saw philosophy the basis for progress the arts and the plato reputation was and least par with notable western philosophers have continued draw upon work since that plato influence has been especially strong mathematics and the helped distinguish between pure and applied mathematics widening the gap between arithmetic now called number theory and logistic now called arithmetic regarded logistic appropriate for business men and men war who must learn the art numbers will not know how array his while arithmetic was appropriate for philosophers because has arise out the sea change and lay hold true plato resurgence further inspired some the greatest advances logic since primarily through gottlob frege and his followers kurt del alonzo church and alfred tarski albert einstein suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have avoid systematization and take many different and possibly appear platonist that such one would have the viewpoint logical simplicity indispensable and effective tool his many recent philosophers have diverged from what some would describe the ontological models and moral ideals characteristic traditional number these postmodern philosophers have thus appeared disparage platonism from more less informed friedrich nietzsche notoriously attacked idea the good along with many fundamentals christian which interpreted platonism for the one his most important beyond good and evil martin heidegger argued against alleged obfuscation being his incomplete being and time and the philosopher science karl popper argued the open society and its enemies that alleged proposal for utopian political regime the republic was prototypically totalitarian the political philosopher and professor leo strauss considered some the prime thinker involved the recovery platonic thought its more and less form strauss political approach was part inspired the appropriation plato and aristotle medieval jewish and islamic political philosophers especially maimonides and farabi opposed the christian metaphysical tradition that developed from neoplatonism deeply influenced nietzsche and strauss nonetheless rejects their condemnation plato and looks the dialogues for solution what all three latter day thinkers acknowledge the crisis the textual sources and history euthyphro greek minuscule list manuscripts dialogues some known manuscripts plato the texts plato received today apparently represent the complete written philosophical work plato and are generally good the standards textual criticism modern edition plato the original greek represents single but rather reconstructed from multiple sources which are compared with each these sources are medieval manuscripts written vellum mainly from century papyri mainly from late antiquity and from the independent testimonia other authors who quote various segments the works which come from variety the text presented usually not much different than what appears the byzantine and papyri and testimonia just confirm the manuscript some editions however the readings the papyri testimonia are favoured some places the editing critic the reviewing editions
