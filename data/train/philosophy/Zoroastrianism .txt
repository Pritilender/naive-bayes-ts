that many the denkard fact have since been refuted among the tale the library widely accepted fictional late antiquity when the sassanid dynasty came into power they aggressively promoted the zurvanite form zoroastrianism some persecuted when the sassanids captured they often built fire temples there promote their after constantine the sassanids were suspicious not least because their perceived ties the christian roman empire such the persian church the church the east officially broke with roman christianity and was tolerated and even sometimes favored the form zoroastrianism was also prominent the christian caucasus region especially day azerbaijan during the periods their suzerainty over the the sassanids made attempts promote the religion there middle ages persecution zoroastrians hamzanama hamza ibn abd muttalib the and over the course least years several decades the case some the sassanid empire was overthrown the arabs although the administration the state was rapidly islamicized and subsumed under the umayyad caliphate there was little serious exerted newly subjected people adopt islamic jurists considered only muslims perfectly and unbelievers might well left their long these did not vex their there were also practical because their sheer the conquered zoroastrians had treated dhimmis despite doubts the validity this that persisted down the which made them eligible for thus the once the conquest was over and local terms were agreed the arab governors protected the local populations exchange for the arabs adopted the sassanid both the tax levied land owners and the poll tax levied this called jizya tax levied muslims living muslim caliphates the dhimmi this tax came used means humble the and number laws and restrictions evolved emphasize their inferior under the early orthodox caliphs long the muslims paid their taxes and adhered the dhimmi laws administrators were enjoined leave muslims their religion and their caliph abu bakr qtd boyce thus though subject new leadership and once the horrors conquest were the zoroastrians were able continue their former there however slow but steady social and economic pressure the nobility and dwellers were the first with islam more slowly being accepted among the peasantry and landed power and now lay with followers and although the official policy was one aloof there were individual muslims eager proselytize and ready use all sorts means tradition evolved which islam was made appear partly iranian one example this was legend that husayn son the fourth caliph ali and grandson prophet muhammad had married captive sassanid princess named shahrbanu this wholly fictitious was said have borne husayn the historical fourth shi imam who claimed that the caliphate rightly belonged him and his and that the umayyads had wrongfully wrested from the alleged descent from the sassanid house counterbalanced the arab nationalism the and the iranian national association with zoroastrian past was thus according scholar mary was longer the zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty the the damning that becoming muslim was equivalent becoming iranian only remained idiom zoroastrian with iranian especially support the abbasids overthrew the umayyads and the subsequent caliphate that nominally lasted until muslim iranians received marked favor the new both iran and the capital baghdad this mitigated the antagonism between arabs and but sharpened the distinction between muslims and the abbasids zealously persecuted heretics and although this was directed mainly muslim sectarians also created harsher climate for although the abbasids were deadly foes the brand islam they propagated throughout iran became turn ever more zoroastrianized making easier for iranians embrace the century was the last which zoroastrians had the means engage creative work great and the century has come define the great number zoroastrian texts that were composed written

belief systems like other practiced religions accommodates some degree syncretism indo iranian origins iranians iranian religion european religion many traits zoroastrianism can traced back the culture and beliefs the prehistorical iranian that the time before the migrations that led the indians and iranians becoming distinct zoroastrianism consequently shares elements with the historical vedic religion that also has its origins that example the relation the zoroastrian word ahura ahura mazda and the vedic word asura meaning they are therefore thought have descended from common proto iranian religion however zoroastrianism was also strongly affected the later culture the iranian heroic age bce influence which the indic religions were not moreover the other culture groups that the respective peoples came interact with were for instance century bce western iran with fertile crescent culture with each side absorbing ideas from the such cultural influences zoroastrian scripture essentially product iranian and representing the oldest and largest corpus islamic iranian considered reflection that then together with the vedas which represent the oldest texts the indian branch

unifying notions deeply influenced the modernists the late and early they have not fared well under the scrutiny more recent interdisciplinary peer the study islamic iran has itself undergone radical change direction since the and the field today disinclined manicheism zoroastrianism often compared with the manichaeism which nominally iranian religion but has its origins the middle eastern gnosticism superficially such comparison may both are uncompromisingly and manichaeism nominally adopted many the yazatas for its own gherardo the encyclopaedia religion says that can assert that manichaeism has its roots the iranian religious tradition and that its relationship more less like that christianity religious they however quite manichaeism equated evil with matter and good with and was therefore particularly suitable doctrinal basis for every form asceticism and many forms zoroastrianism the other rejects every form has dualism matter and spirit only good and and sees the spiritual world not very different from the natural and the word paradise via latin and greek from avestan pairi daeza literally bounded applies equally manichaeism basic doctrine was that the world and all corporeal bodies were constructed from the substance idea that fundamentally odds with the zoroastrian notion world that was created god and that all and any corruption effect the from what may inferred from many manichean texts and few zoroastrian the adherents the two religions least their respective despised each other present day iran many aspects zoroastrianism are present the culture and mythologies the peoples the greater iran not least because zoroastrianism was dominant influence the people the cultural continent for thousand even after the rise islam and the loss

zoroastrianism approximate date bce has been established through archaeological evidence and linguistic comparisons with the hindu text rig veda however there way knowing exactly when zoroaster lived his were prehistoric depending different thought that lived some time between bce bce zoroaster was born either northeast iran southwest was born into bronze age culture with polytheistic religion which included animal sacrifice and the ritual use this religion was quite similar the early forms hinduism the name zoroaster greek rendering the name zarathustra known zartosht and zardosht persian and zaratosht gujarati zoroaster birth and early life are little what known recorded the gathas the core the which contains hymns thought composed zoroaster born into the spitama clan worked had three and three zoroaster rejected the religion the bronze age with their many gods and oppressive class structure which the karvis and karapans princes and controlled the ordinary also opposed animal sacrifices and the use the hallucinogenic haoma plant possibly species ephedra but held the rooster symbol and associated the cock with good against because his heraldic vision zoroaster according zoroastrian when zoroaster was years went into the daiti river draw water for haoma ceremony when received vision vohu after vohu manah took him the other six amesha where received the completion his this vision radically transformed his view the and tried teach this view zoroaster believed one creator teaching that only one god was worthy furthermore some the deities the old the daevas devas appeared delight war and zoroaster said that these were evil spirits and were workers angra god zoroaster ideas did not take off and only had one his cousin the local religious authorities opposed his they felt their own power and particularly their were threatened because zoroaster taught against ritualising religious many ordinary people did not like downgrading the daevas evil after years zoroaster left his home find somewhere more open new found such place the country king vishtaspa bactria the king and his hutosa heard zoroaster debating with the religious leaders his and decided accept ideas and make them the official religion their zoroaster died his late very little known the time between zoroaster and the achaemenian period except during this zoroastrianism spread western the time the founding the achaemenid zoroastrianism was already established principal beliefs hukhta huvarshta good good good are the basic tenants the faravahar fravashi ahura mazda the beginning and the the creator everything that can and cannot the the pure and the only the gathas the most sacred texts zoroastrianism thought have been composed zoroaster the prophet acknowledged devotion other divinity besides ahura daena din modern persian the eternal whose order was revealed humanity through the mathra spenta holy daena has been used mean faith law and even translation for the hindu and buddhist term dharma the latter often interpreted duty but can also mean social right the metaphor the path daena represented zoroastrianism the muslin undershirt sudra the holy and the thread kushti girdle the pathfinder daena should not confused with the fundamental principle asha vedic rta the equitable law the which governed the life the ancient for asha was the course everything the motion the planets and astral the progression the and the pattern daily nomadic herdsman governed regular metronomic events such sunrise and all physical creation geti was thus determined run according master inherent ahura and violations the order druj were violations against and thus violations against ahura this concept asha versus the druj should not confused with the evil battle evident western for although both forms opposition express moral the asha versus druj concept more systemic and less representing for chaos that opposes uncreation evident natural decay that opposes more simply the that opposes truth and moreover his role the one uncreated creator ahura mazda not the creator druj which nothing anti and thus uncreated thus ahura mazda was perceived the creator only the good yasna the supreme benevolent yasna that will ultimately triumph yasna parsi this schema asha versus druj mortal beings both humans and play critical for they too are here their they are active participants the and their duty defend which would decay without counter action throughout the gathas zoroaster emphasizes deeds and and accordingly asceticism frowned upon later this was explained fleeing from the experiences which was the very purpose that the urvan most commonly translated the soul was sent into the mortal world the avoidance any aspect which includes the avoidance the pleasures shirking the responsibility and duty one urvan and family and social central zoroastrianism the emphasis moral choose the responsibility and duty for which one the mortal give this duty and facilitate the work druj similarly predestination rejected zoroastrian humans bear responsibility for all situations they are and the way they act toward one reward punishment happiness and grief all depend how individuals live their good transpires for those who righteous those who evil have themselves blame for their zoroastrian morality then summed the simple good good good humata hukhta hvarshta avestan for through these that asha maintained and druj kept through several other beliefs were introduced the religion some supersede those expressed the gathas the late the moral and immoral forces came represented spenta mainyu and its antithesis angra mainyu the good and evil emanations ahura respectively although the names are this opposition modern influenced development popularized martin haug the and realignment the precepts zurvanism zurvanite which had postulated third deity zurvan explain mention twinship yasna between the moral and although zurvanism had died out the the critical question the twin mentioned yasna remained and explanation provided convenient defence against christian who disparaged the parsis for their dualism haug concept was subsequently disseminated parsi thus corroborating and the idea became popular that now almost universally accepted citation needed achaemenid era bce zoroastrianism developed the abstract concepts heaven and well personal and final all which are only alluded the gathas yasna which has only survived sassanid era zend commentary the ahuna vairya invocation prescribes path judgment known the chinvat peretum chinvat bridge which all souls had and judgment over words and deeds performed during was passed they were doing however the zoroastrian personal judgment not the end when evil finally all souls will ultimately reunited with their fravashi thus zoroastrianism can said universalist religion with respect and strongly influenced babylonian and akkadian practices the achaemenids popularized shrines and hitherto alien forms the wake achaemenid shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role mithra aredvi sura anahita verethregna and tishtrya all addition their original iranian now also received babylonian creation the universe according the zoroastrian story creation ahura mazda existed light goodness while angra mainyu existed darkness and ignorance they have existed independently

the archetypical perfect and the first while ahura mazda created the universe and angra whose instinct miscreated evil yazads and noxious creatures khrafstar such ants and angra mainyu created evil

universe and could not the dying primordial man and bull emitted from the seed grew all beneficial plants and animals the and from the seed grew plant whose leaves became the first human man thus struggles fold universe trapped with the evils this physical world are not products inherent but are the fault angra assault this assault turned the perfectly peaceful and ever lit world into violent
