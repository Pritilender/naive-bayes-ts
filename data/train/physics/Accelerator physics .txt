magnetostatic fields that deflect most accelerator concepts excluding compact structures like the cyclotron betatron these are applied dedicated electromagnets with different properties and important step the development these types accelerators was the understanding strong focusing dipole magnets are used guide the beam through the while quadrupole magnets are used for beam and sextupole magnets are used for correction dispersion effects particle the exact design trajectory design orbit the accelerator only experiences dipole field while particles with transverse position deviation are
