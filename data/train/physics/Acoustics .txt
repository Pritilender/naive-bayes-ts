ultrasound and infrasound scientist who works the field acoustics acoustician while someone working the field acoustics technology may called acoustical engineer the application acoustics present almost all aspects modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries hearing one the most crucial means survival the animal and speech one the most distinctive characteristics human development and accordingly the science acoustics spreads across many facets human medicine architecture industrial warfare and art craft science and technology have provoked one another advance the many other fields robert bruce lindsay wheel well accepted overview the various fields the word acoustic derived from the greek word akoustikos meaning for ready and that from akoustos audible which turn derives from the verb akouo the latin synonym sonic after which the term sonics used synonym for acoustics and later branch frequencies above and below the audible range are called ultrasonic and infrasonic respectively contents history acoustics early research acoustics age enlightenment and onward fundamental concepts acoustics wave pressure levels wave frequency

history acoustics early research acoustics fundamental overtones pythagoras the century the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted know why some combinations musical sounds seemed more beautiful than and found answers terms numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series reputed have observed that when the lengths vibrating strings are expressible ratios integers the tones produced will and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the for string certain length would sound particularly harmonious with string twice the length other factors being modern string sounds the note when string twice long will sound octave one system musical tuning the tones between are then given for for for for for and for ascending aristotle understood that sound consisted contractions and expansions the air falling upon and striking the air which next very good expression the nature wave motion about the roman architect and engineer vitruvius wrote treatise the acoustic properties theaters including discussion echoes and the beginnings architectural acoustics book his architectura the ten books architecture vitruvius describes sound wave comparable water wave extended three which when interrupted would flow back and break following described the ascending seats ancient theaters designed prevent this deterioration sound and also recommended bronze vessels appropriate sizes placed theaters resonate with the fifth and the double order resonate with the more harmonious roman theatre amman the physical understanding acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the scientific revolution mainly galileo galilei but also marin mersenne independently discovered the complete laws vibrating strings completing what pythagoras and pythagoreans had started years galileo wrote waves are produced the vibrations sonorous which spread through the bringing the tympanum the ear stimulus which the mind interprets remarkable statement that points the beginnings physiological and psychological experimental measurements the speed sound air were carried out successfully between and number prominently meanwhile newton derived the relationship for wave velocity cornerstone physical acoustics principia age enlightenment and onward the eighteenth century saw major advances acoustics mathematicians applied the new techniques calculus elaborate theories sound wave the nineteenth century the major figures mathematical acoustics were helmholtz who consolidated the field physiological and lord rayleigh who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions the field his monumental work the theory sound also the wheatstone ohm and henry developed the analogy between electricity and the twentieth century saw burgeoning technological applications the large body scientific knowledge that was then the first such application was sabine groundbreaking work architectural and many others underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines the first world sound recording and the telephone played important roles global transformation sound measurement and analysis reached new levels accuracy and sophistication through the use electronics and the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds application medicine and new kinds transducers generators and receivers acoustic were invented and put fundamental concepts acoustics jay pritzker pavilion jay pritzker pavilion lares sound reinforcement system the study acoustics revolves around the propagation and reception mechanical waves and the steps shown the above diagram can found any acoustical event there are many kinds both natural and there are many kinds transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic producing sound there one fundamental equation that describes sound wave the acoustic wave equation but the phenomena that emerge from are varied and often the wave carries energy throughout the propagating eventually this energy transduced again into other ways that again may natural volitionally the final effect may purely physical may reach far into the biological volitional the five basic steps are found equally well whether are talking about earthquake submarine using sonar locate its band playing rock the central stage the acoustical process wave this falls within the domain physical fluids sound propagates primarily pressure wave mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves transverse waves and surface waves acoustics looks first the pressure levels and frequencies the sound transduction processes are also special wave pressure levels sound pressure spectrogram fluids such air and sound waves propagate disturbances the ambient pressure while this disturbance usually still noticeable the human the smallest sound that person can known the threshold hearing nine orders magnitude smaller than the ambient the loudness these disturbances called the sound pressure level and measured logarithmic scale wave frequency physicists and acoustic engineers tend discuss sound pressure levels terms partly because this how our ears interpret what experience higher lower sounds are pressure vibrations having higher lower number cycles per common technique acoustic acoustic signals are sampled and then presented more meaningful forms such octave bands time frequency both these popular methods are used analyze sound and better understand the acoustic the entire spectrum can divided into three audio ultrasonic and the audio range falls between and this range important because its frequencies can detected the human this range has number including speech communication and the ultrasonic range refers the very high and this range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution imaging medical applications such ultrasonography and elastography rely the ultrasonic frequency the other end the the lowest frequencies are known the infrasonic these frequencies can used study geological phenomena such analytic instruments such the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement acoustic signals and their the spectrogram produced such instrument graphical display the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give specific acoustic signal its defining transduction acoustics driver transducer device for converting one form energy into electroacoustic this means converting sound energy into electrical energy vice electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers microphones hydrophones and sonar projectors these devices convert sound pressure wave from electric the most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism electrostatics and piezoelectricity the transducers most common loudspeakers woofers and tweeters are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using suspended diaphragm driven electromagnetic voice coil sending off pressure electret microphones and condenser microphones employ the sound wave strikes the moves and induces voltage the ultrasonic systems used medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric these are made from special ceramics which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through property the material acoustician acoustician expert the science education there are many types but they usually have bachelor degree higher some possess degree while others
