physics	astroparticle physics particle astrophysics navigation search astroparticle physics astroparticle physics also called particle astrophysics branch particle physics that studies elementary particles astronomical origin and their relation astrophysics and cosmology relatively new field research emerging the intersection particle astronomy astrophysics detector relativity solid state and partly motivated the discovery neutrino oscillation the field has undergone rapid both theoretically and since the early contents history topics research open questions experimental facilities see also references external links history the field astroparticle physics evolved out optical with the growth detector technology came the more mature which involved multiple physics such mechanics electrodynamics thermodynamics plasma physics nuclear physics relativity and particle physics particle physicists found astrophysics necessary due difficulty producing particles with comparable energy those found for the cosmic ray spectrum contains particles with energies high where antiproton collision the large hadron collider occurs energy few tev the field can said have begun when german physicist named theodor wulf measured the ionization the indicator gamma the bottom and top the eiffel found that there was far more ionization the top than what was expected only terrestrial sources were attributed for this victor francis hess then austrian hypothesized that some the ionization was caused radiation from the order defend this hess designed instruments capable operating high altitudes and performed observations ionization altitude from hess made ten flights meticulously measure ionization through prior did not expect there any ionization altitude terrestrial sources were the sole cause his measurements revealed that although the ionization levels initially decreased with they began sharply rise some the peaks his found that the ionization levels were much greater than the hess was then able conclude that radiation very high penetrating power enters our atmosphere from furthermore one flights was during total eclipse the since did not observe dip ionization hess reasoned that the source had further away for this hess was one the people awarded the nobel prize physics robert millikan confirmed findings and subsequently coined the term cosmic rays many physicists knowledgeable about the origins the field astroparticle physics prefer attribute this cosmic rays hess the starting point for the topics research while may difficult decide standard description the field astroparticle the field can characterized the topics research that are actively being the astroparticle physics journal published elsevier accepts papers that are focused new developments the following high energy ray physics and astrophysics particle particle related supernova active galactic nuclei cosmic dark matter etc high vhe and uhe ray high and energy neutrino instrumentation and detector developments related the mentioned open questions one main task for the future the field simply thoroughly define itself beyond working definitions and clearly differentiate itself from astrophysics and other related current unsolved problem for the field astroparticle physics dark matter and dark energy observations the orbital velocities stars the milky way and the velocities galaxies galactic the energy density the visible matter the universe far too insufficient account for the since the early nineties some candidates have been found partially explain some the missing dark but they are nowhere near sufficient offer full the finding accelerating universe suggests that large part the missing dark matter stored dark energy dynamical another question for astroparticle physicists why there much more matter than antimatter the universe baryogenesis the term for the hypothetical processes that produced the unequal numbers baryons and anitbaryons the early which why the universe made matter and not experimental facilities the rapid development this field has led the design new types underground laboratories with specially designed antennas and satellite astroparticle physicists employ new detection methods observe wide range cosmic particles including gamma rays and cosmic rays the highest they are also searching for dark matter and gravitational experimental particle physicists are limited the technology their terrestrial which are only able produce small fraction the energies found facilities experiments and laboratories involved astroparticle physics icecube antarctica the longest particle detector the was completed december the purpose the detector investigate high energy search for dark observe supernovae and search for exotic particles such magnetic antares toulon france neutrino detector under the mediterranean sea off the coast france designed locate and observe neutrino flux the direction the southern pierre auger observatory malarg argentina detects and investigates high energy cosmic rays using two one study the particles interactions with water placed surface detector the
