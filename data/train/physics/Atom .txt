cannot divided history atomic theory atomic theory atoms philosophy atomism the idea that matter made discrete units very old appearing many ancient cultures such greece and the word atom was coined ancient greek however these ideas were founded philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and their views what atoms look like and how they behave were very they also convince atomism was but one number competing theories the nature until the century that the idea was embraced and refined when the blossoming science chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept atoms could first based theory john dalton new system chemical philosophy the early john dalton used the concept atoms explain why elements always react ratios small whole numbers the law multiple proportions for there are two types tin oxide one tin and oxygen and the other tin and oxygen tin oxide and tin dioxide respectively this means that tin will combine either with and form ratio this common pattern chemistry suggested dalton that elements react whole number multiples discrete other atoms the case tin one tin atom will combine with either one two oxygen dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases different for found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than absorbs nitrogen dalton hypothesized this was due the differences mass and complexity the respective indeed carbon dioxide molecules are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules botanist robert brown used microscope look dust grains floating water and discovered that they moved about phenomenon that became known brownian motion this was thought caused water molecules knocking the grains albert einstein produced the first mathematical analysis the french physicist jean perrin used work experimentally determine the mass and dimensions thereby conclusively verifying atomic the structure atoms the gold foil experiment bottom the physicist thomson through his work cathode rays discovered the and concluded that they were component every thus overturned the belief that atoms are the ultimate particles thomson postulated that the low negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom uniform sea positive this became known the plum pudding model hans geiger and ernest marsden under the direction ernest rutherford bombarded metal foil with alpha particles observe how they going plum pudding all the alpha particles should have passed straight through the foil with little because the positive charge its atoms should have been too dilute affect them they instead observed small fraction alpha particles being deflected angles greater than explain rutherford proposed that each atom has nucleus where the positive charge and most the mass are and these were what were deflecting those alpha particles while experimenting with the products radioactive decay radiochemist frederick soddy discovered that there appeared more than one type atom each position the periodic the term isotope was coined margaret todd suitable name for different atoms that belong the same thomson created technique for separating atom types through his work ionized which subsequently led the discovery stable isotopes meanwhile physicist niels bohr suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly quantized and could jump between but could not freely spiral inward outward intermediate states like satellites orbiting electron must absorb emit specific amounts energy transition between these fixed this explained why the electrons spiral down into the and why elements absorb and emit light discrete later the same year henry moseley provided additional experimental evidence favor niels theory these results refined ernest rutherford and antonius van den broek which proposed that the atom contains its nucleus number positive nuclear charges that equal its number the periodic until these atomic number was not known physical and experimental that equal the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model chemical bonds between atoms were now gilbert newton lewis the interactions between their constituent the chemical properties the elements were known largely repeat themselves according the periodic law the american chemist irving langmuir suggested that this could explained the electrons atom were connected clustered some groups electrons were thought occupy set electron shells about the the stern gerlach experiment provided further evidence the quantum nature the when beam silver atoms was passed through specially shaped magnetic the beam was split based the direction angular this direction the beam could expected spread into instead the beam was split into two depending whether the atomic spin was oriented louis broglie proposed that all particles behave extent like erwin dinger used this idea develop mathematical model the atom that described the electrons dimensional waveforms rather than point consequence using waveforms describe particles that mathematically impossible obtain precise values for both the position and momentum particle the same this became known the uncertainty principle formulated werner heisenberg this for given accuracy measuring position one could only obtain range probable values for and vice this model was able explain observations atomic behavior that previous models could such certain structural and spectral patterns atoms larger than thus the planetary model the atom was discarded favor one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where given electron most likely the development the mass spectrometer allowed the exact mass atoms the device uses magnet bend the trajectory beam and the amount deflection determined the ratio mass its the chemist francis william aston used this instrument show that isotopes had different the atomic mass these isotopes varied integer called the whole number rule the explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery the neutron charged particle with mass similar the proton the physicist james chadwick isotopes were then explained elements with the same number but different numbers neutrons within the fission high energy physics and condensed matter the german chemist otto hahn student directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting get transuranium elements instead his chemical experiments showed barium year lise meitner and her nephew otto frisch verified that result were the first experimental nuclear fission hahn received the nobel prize despite the contributions meitner and frisch were not the the development improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists study the impacts atoms moving high neutrons and protons were found hadrons composites smaller particles called quarks the standard model particle physics was developed that far has successfully explained the properties the nucleus terms these atomic particles and the forces that govern their structure subatomic particles subatomic particle though the word atom originally denoted particle that cannot cut into smaller modern scientific usage the atom composed various subatomic particles the constituent particles atom are the electron the proton and the neutron all three are fermions however the hydrogen atom has neutrons and the hydron ion has the electron far the least massive these particles with negative electrical charge and size that too small measured using available the lightest particle with positive rest mass under ordinary electrons are bound the positively charged nucleus the attraction created from opposite electric atom have more fewer electrons than its atomic then become respectively negatively positively charged charged atom called ion electrons are known since the late mostly thanks thomson see history subatomic physics for protons have positive charge and mass times that the the number protons atom called its atomic number ernest rutherford observed that nitrogen under particle bombardment ejects what appeared hydrogen had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus distinct particle within the atom and named proton neutrons have electrical charge and have free mass times the mass the the heaviest the three constituent but can reduced the nuclear binding energy neutrons and protons collectively known nucleons have comparable the order although the these particles not sharply the neutron was discovered the english physicist james chadwick the standard model electrons are truly elementary particles with internal however both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed elementary particles called quarks there are two types quarks each having fractional electric protons are composed two quarks each with charge and one down quark with charge neutrons consist one quark and two down this distinction accounts for the difference mass and charge between the two the quarks are held together the strong interaction strong which mediated gluons the protons and are held each other the nucleus the nuclear force which residuum the strong force that has somewhat different properties see the article the nuclear force for the gluon member the family gauge bosons which are elementary particles that mediate physical nucleus atomic nucleus binding energy all the bound protons and neutrons atom make tiny atomic nucleus and are collectively called nucleons the radius nucleus approximately equal where the total number this much smaller than the radius the which the order the nucleons are bound together ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force distances smaller than this force much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons repel each atoms the same element have the same number called the atomic number within single the number neutrons may determining the isotope that the total number protons and neutrons determine the nuclide the number neutrons relative the protons determines the stability the with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay the the and the neutron are classified fermions fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions such multiple from occupying the same quantum state the same thus every proton the nucleus must occupy quantum state different from all other and the same applies all neutrons the nucleus and all electrons the electron however proton and neutron are allowed occupy the same quantum for atoms with low atomic nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends drop lower energy state through radioactive decay that the neutron proton ratio closer however the atomic number higher proportion neutrons required offset the mutual repulsion the thus there are stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number and increases the proton ratio stable isotopes the stable isotope with the highest neutron ration lead about positron antimatter neutrino the number protons and neutrons the atomic nucleus can although this can require very high energies because the strong nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join form heavier such through the energetic collision two for the core the sun protons require energies kev overcome their mutual the coulomb barrier and fuse together into single nuclear fission the opposite causing nucleus split into two smaller usually through radioactive the nucleus can also modified through bombardment high energy subatomic particles this modifies the number protons the atom changes different chemical the mass the nucleus following fusion reaction less than the sum the masses the separate then the difference between these two values can emitted type usable energy such gamma ray the kinetic energy beta particle described albert einstein mass energy equivalence formula where the mass loss and the speed light this deficit part the binding energy the new and the recoverable loss the energy that causes the fused particles remain together state that requires this energy the fusion two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel total nucleon number about usually exothermic process that releases more energy than required bring them this releasing process that makes nuclear fusion stars sustaining for heavier the binding energy per nucleon the nucleus begins that means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about and atomic masses higher than about endothermic process these more massive nuclei can not undergo producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium electron cloud atomic orbital electron configuration classical mechanics the electrons atom are attracted the protons the nucleus the electromagnetic force this force binds the electrons inside electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller which means that external source energy needed for the electron the closer electron the the greater the attractive hence electrons bound near the center the potential well require more energy escape than those greater electrons like other have properties both particle and wave the electron cloud region inside the potential well where each electron forms type dimensional standing wave wave form that does not move relative the this behavior defined atomic orbital mathematical function that characterises the probability that electron appears particular location when its position only discrete quantized set these orbitals exist around the other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into more stable orbitals can have one more ring node and they differ from each other shape and node play media each atomic orbital corresponds particular energy level the the electron can change its state higher energy level absorbing photon with sufficient energy boost into the new quantum likewise through spontaneous emission electron higher energy state can drop lower energy state while radiating the excess energy these characteristic energy defined the differences the energies the quantum are responsible for atomic spectral lines the amount energy needed remove add the electron binding energy far less than the binding energy nucleons for requires only strip ground state electron from hydrogen compared million for splitting deuterium nucleus atoms are electrically neutral they have equal number protons and atoms that have either deficit surplus electrons are called ions electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may transferred other nearby atoms shared between this atoms are able bond into molecules and other types chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals properties nuclear properties isotope stable isotope list nuclides list elements stability isotopes any two atoms with identical number protons their nuclei belong the same chemical element atoms with equal numbers protons but different number neutrons are different isotopes the same for all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one but isotopes exist with neutrons hydrogen far the most common also called one neutron deuterium two neutrons tritium and more than two neutrons the known elements form set atomic from the single proton element hydrogen the proton element ununoctium all known isotopes elements with atomic numbers greater than are about nuclides occur naturally earth which about have not been observed and are referred stable isotopes however only these nuclides are stable all even theory another bringing the total have not been observed even though theory energetically these are also formally classified stable additional radioactive nuclides have lives longer than million and are lived enough present from the birth the solar system this collection nuclides are known primordial nuclides finally additional short lived nuclides are known occur daughter products primordial nuclide decay such radium from uranium else products natural energetic processes such cosmic ray bombardment for carbon note for the chemical least one stable isotope exists there only handful stable isotopes for each these the average being stable isotopes per twenty six elements have only single stable while the largest number stable isotopes observed for any element for the element tin elements and all elements numbered higher have stable page needed stability isotopes affected the ratio protons and also the presence certain magic neutrons protons that represent closed and filled quantum these quantum shells correspond set energy levels within the shell model the filled such the filled shell protons for confers unusual stability the the known stable only four have both odd number protons and odd number hydrogen deuterium lithium boron and nitrogen also only four naturally radioactive odd nuclides have life over billion potassium vanadium lanthanum and tantalum most odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect beta decay because the decay products are and are therefore more strongly due nuclear pairing effects page needed mass atomic mass mass number the large majority mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make the total number these particles called nucleons given atom called the mass number the mass number simple whole and has units example use mass number which has nucleons six protons and six the actual mass atom rest often expressed using the unified atomic mass unit which also called dalton this unit defined twelfth the mass free neutral atom carbon which approximately hydrogen the lightest isotope hydrogen and the atom with the lowest has atomic weight the value this number called the atomic mass given atom has atomic mass approximately equal within its mass number times the mass the atomic mass however this number will not exact whole number except the case see the heaviest stable atom with mass even the most massive atoms are far too light work with chemists instead use the unit moles one mole atoms any element always has the same number atoms about this number was chosen that element has atomic mass mole atoms that element has mass close one because the definition the unified atomic mass unit each atom has atomic mass exactly and mole atoms weighs exactly page needed shape and size atomic radius atoms lack defined outer their dimensions are usually described terms atomic radius this measure the distance out which the electron cloud extends from the citation needed however this assumes the atom exhibit spherical which only obeyed for atoms vacuum free atomic radii may derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined chemical bond the radius varies with the location atom the atomic the type chemical the number neighboring atoms coordination number and quantum mechanical property known spin the periodic table the atom size tends increase when moving down but decrease when moving across rows left consequently the smallest atom helium with radius while one the largest caesium when subjected external like electrical field the shape atom may deviate from spherical symmetry the deformation depends the field magnitude and the orbital type outer shell shown group theoretical considerations aspherical deviations might elicited for instance crystals where large electrical fields may occur low symmetry lattice significant ellipsoidal deformations have recently been shown occur for sulfur ions pyrite type atomic dimensions are thousands times smaller than the wavelengths light they can not viewed using optical microscope however individual atoms can observed using scanning tunneling microscope visualize the minuteness the consider that typical human hair about million carbon atoms single drop water contains about sextillion atoms and twice the number hydrogen single carat diamond with mass contains about sextillion atoms carbon note apple were magnified the size the then the atoms the apple would approximately the size the original radioactive decay radioactive decay life every element has one more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject radioactive causing the nucleus emit particles electromagnetic radioactivity can occur when the radius nucleus large compared with the radius the strong which only acts over distances the order the most common forms radioactive decay alpha decay this process caused when the nucleus emits alpha which helium nucleus consisting two protons and two the result the emission new element with lower atomic number beta decay and electron capture these processes are regulated the weak force and result from transformation neutron into proton into the neutron proton transition accompanied the emission electron and antineutrino while proton neutron transition except electron causes the emission positron and neutrino the electron positron emissions are called beta beta decay either increases decreases the atomic number the nucleus electron capture more common than positron because requires less this type electron absorbed the rather than positron emitted from the neutrino still emitted this and proton changes gamma decay this process results from change the energy level the nucleus lower resulting the emission electromagnetic the excited state nucleus which results gamma emission usually occurs following the emission alpha beta thus gamma decay usually follows alpha beta other more rare types radioactive decay include ejection neutrons protons clusters nucleons from more than one beta particle analog gamma emission which allows excited nuclei lose energy different internal conversion process that produces speed electrons that are not beta followed production energy photons that are not gamma few large nuclei explode into two more charged fragments varying masses plus several decay called spontaneous nuclear fission each radioactive isotope has characteristic decay time the half life that determined the amount time needed for half sample this exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion the remaining isotope every hence after two lives have passed only the isotope and magnetic moment electron magnetic dipole moment nuclear magnetic moment elementary particles possess intrinsic quantum mechanical property known spin this analogous the angular momentum object that spinning around its center mass although strictly speaking these particles are believed like and cannot said spin measured units the reduced planck constant with protons and neutrons all having spin electrons motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum addition their while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due its nuclear the magnetic field produced its magnetic moment determined these various forms angular just rotating charged object classically produces magnetic however the most dominant contribution comes from due the nature electrons obey the pauli exclusion principle which two electrons may found the same quantum state bound electrons pair with each with one member each pair spin state and the other the spin down thus these spins cancel each other reducing the total magnetic dipole moment zero some atoms with even number ferromagnetic elements such odd number electrons leads unpaired electron and net overall magnetic the orbitals neighboring atoms overlap and lower energy state achieved when the spins unpaired electrons are aligned with each process known exchange interaction when the magnetic moments ferromagnetic atoms are lined the material can produce measurable macroscopic paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line random directions when magnetic field but the magnetic moments the individual atoms line the presence the nucleus atom can also have net normally these nuclei are aligned random directions because thermal equilibrium however for certain elements such xenon possible polarize significant proportion the nuclear spin states that they are aligned the same condition called hyperpolarization this has important applications magnetic resonance imaging energy levels cadmium the potential energy electron atom negative its dependence its position reaches the minimum the most absolute value inside the and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes infinity roughly inverse proportion the the mechanical bound electron can only occupy set states centered the and each state corresponds specific energy level see time independent dinger equation for theoretical energy level can measured the amount energy needed unbind the electron from the and usually given units electronvolts the lowest energy state bound electron called the ground stationary state while electron transition higher level results excited the energy raises when increases because the distance the nucleus dependence the energy caused not electrostatic potential the but interaction between for electron transition between two different states grounded state first excited level ionization must absorb emit photon energy matching the difference the potential energy those according niels bohr model what can precisely calculated the schr dinger equation electrons jump between orbitals like for single photon strikes the only single electron changes states response the see electron properties the energy emitted photon proportional its frequency these specific energy levels appear distinct bands the electromagnetic spectrum each element has characteristic spectrum that can depend the nuclear subshells filled the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other when continuous spectrum energy passed through gas plasma some the photons are absorbed causing electrons change their energy those excited electrons that remain bound their atom spontaneously emit this energy traveling random and drop back lower energy thus the atoms behave like filter that forms series dark absorption bands the energy observer viewing the atoms from view that does not include the continuous spectrum the instead sees series emission lines from the photons emitted the spectroscopic measurements the strength and width atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties substance close examination the spectral lines reveals that some display fine structure splitting this occurs because spin orbit coupling which interaction between the spin and motion the outermost when atom external magnetic spectral lines become split into three more phenomenon called the zeeman effect this caused the interaction the magnetic field with the magnetic moment the atom and its some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy which thus appear single spectral the interaction the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations slightly different energy resulting multiple spectral the presence external electric field can cause comparable splitting and shifting spectral lines modifying the electron energy phenomenon called the stark effect bound electron excited interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission photon with matching energy for this the electron must drop lower energy state that has energy difference matching the energy the interacting the emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off parallel and with matching that the wave patterns the two photons are this physical property used make lasers which can emit coherent beam light energy narrow frequency valence and bonding behavior valence chemical bond the outermost electron shell atom its uncombined state known the valence shell and the electrons that shell are called valence electrons the number valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms tend chemically react with each other manner that fills their outer valence for transfer single electron between atoms useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with electron more than filled and others that are electron short full such occurs the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic however many elements display multiple tendencies share differing numbers electrons different thus chemical bonding between these elements takes many forms sharing that are more than simple electron examples include the element carbon and the organic compounds the chemical elements are often displayed periodic table that laid out display recurring chemical and elements with the same number valence electrons form group that aligned the same column
