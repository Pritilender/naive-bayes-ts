atomic and molecular physics atomic physics molecular physics atomic physics the subfield amo that studies atoms isolated system electrons and atomic nucleus while molecular physics the study the physical properties molecules the term atomic physics often associated with nuclear power and nuclear bombs due the synonymous use atomic and nuclear standard english however physicists distinguish between atomic physics which deals with the atom system consisting nucleus and electrons and nuclear physics which considers atomic nuclei alone the important experimental techniques are the various types spectroscopy molecular while closely related atomic physics also overlaps greatly with theoretical chemistry physical chemistry and chemical physics both subfields are primarily concerned with electronic structure and the dynamical processes which these arrangements generally this work involves using quantum for molecular physics this approach known quantum chemistry one important aspect molecular physics that the essential atomic orbital theory the field atomic physics expands the molecular orbital theory molecular physics concerned with atomic processes but additionally concerned with effects due the molecular structure additionally the electronic excitation states which are known from molecules are able rotate and these rotations and vibrations are there are discrete energy levels the smallest energy differences exist between different rotational therefore pure rotational spectra are the far infrared region about wavelength the electromagnetic spectrum vibrational spectra are the near infrared about and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly the visible and ultraviolet regions from measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties molecules like the distance between the nuclei can with many scientific strict delineation can highly contrived and atomic physics often considered the wider context atomic molecular and optical

communications medicine manufacturing and even entertainment history and developments atomic theory basics quantum mechanics bohr model hydrogen atom one the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed atoms modern terms the basic unit chemical element this theory was developed john dalton the this clear what atoms were although they could described and classified their observable properties summarized the developing periodic table john newlands and dmitri mendeleyev around the mid late later the connection between atomic physics and optical physics became the discovery spectral lines and attempts describe the phenomenon notably joseph von fraunhofer fresnel and others the from that time the physicists were seeking explain atomic spectra and blackbody radiation one attempt explain hydrogen spectral lines was the bohr atom model experiments including electromagnetic radiation and matter such the photoelectric effect compton effect and spectra sunlight the due the unknown element helium the limitation the bohr model and numerous other lead entirely new mathematical model matter and quantum mechanics classical oscillator model matter early models explain the origin the index refraction treated electron atomic system classically according the model paul drude and hendrik lorentz the theory was developed attempt provide origin for the dependent refractive index this incident electromagnetic waves forced electron bound atom oscillate the amplitude the oscillation would then have relationship the frequency the incident electromagnetic wave and the resonant frequencies the the superposition these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead wave which moved more early quantum model matter and light max planck derived formula describe the electromagnetic field inside box when thermal equilibrium his model consisted superposition standing waves one the box has length and only sinusodial waves wavenumber can occur the where positive integer mathematically denoted the equation describing these standing waves given where the magnitude the electric field amplitude and the magnitude the electric field position from this planck law was ernest rutherford concluded based alpha particle that atom has central pointlike also thought that electron would still attracted the proton which had verified still held small believed that electrons revolved around the niels bohr combined the rutherford model the atom with the quantisation ideas only specific and defined orbits the electron could which also not radiate jumping orbit the electron would emit absorb light corresponding the difference energy the his prediction the energy levels was then consistent with these based discrete set specific standing were inconsistent with the continuous classical oscillator work albert einstein the photoelectric effect led the association light wave frequency with photon energy einstein created extension bohrs model the introduction the three processes stimulated emission spontaneous emission and absorption electromagnetic modern treatments the largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation quantum mechanics with the matrix mechanics approach werner heisenberg and the discovery the schr dinger equation erwin dinger there are variety classical treatments within which aspects the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classical dependent the specific problem the classical approach ubiquitous computational work within largely due the large decrease computational cost and complexity associated with for matter under the action fully quantum mechanical treatment the atomic molecular system combined with the system being under the action classical electromagnetic since the field treated classically can not deal with spontaneous emission this classical treatment valid for most particular those under the action high intensity laser the distinction between optical physics and quantum optics the use classical and fully quantum treatments within collision dynamics and using the classical the internal degrees freedom may treated quantum whilst the relative motion the quantum systems under consideration are treated when considering medium high speed the nuclei can treated classically while the electron treated quantum low speed collisions the approximation classical carlo methods for the dynamics electrons can described classical that the initial conditions are calculated using fully quantum but all further treatment isolated atoms and molecules atomic molecular and optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules isolation atomic models will consist single nucleus that may surrounded one more bound whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its molecular hydrogen ion not concerned with the formation molecules although much the physics nor does examine atoms solid state condensed matter concerned with processes such ionization above threshold ionization and excitation photons collisions with atomic while modelling atoms isolation may not seem one considers molecules gas plasma then the scales for molecule interactions are huge comparison the atomic and molecular processes that are concerned this means that the individual molecules can treated each were isolation for the vast majority the time they this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory plasma physics and atmospheric physics even though both deal with huge numbers electronic configuration electrons form notional shells around the these are naturally ground state but can excited the absorption energy from light photons magnetic interaction with colliding particle typically other electrons that populate shell are said bound state the energy necessary remove electron from its shell taking called the binding energy any quantity energy absorbed the electron excess this amount converted kinetic energy according the conservation energy the atom said have undergone the process ionization the event that the electron absorbs quantity energy less than the binding may transition excited state virtual state after statistically sufficient quantity electron excited state will undergo transition lower state via spontaneous emission the change energy between the two energy levels must accounted for conservation neutral the system will emit photon the difference however one its inner shell electrons has been phenomenon known the auger effect may take place where the quantity energy transferred one the bound electrons causing into the this allows one multiply ionize atom with single there are strict selection rules the electronic configurations that can
