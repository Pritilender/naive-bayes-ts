universe expanding consequently the universe was denser and hotter the moreover the big bang model suggests that some moment all matter the universe was contained single which considered the beginning the modern measurements place this moment approximately billion years which thus considered the age the universe after the initial the universe cooled sufficiently allow the formation subatomic particles including protons neutrons and electrons though simple atomic nuclei formed within the first three minutes after the big thousands years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed the majority atoms that were produced the big bang are hydrogen along with helium and traces lithium giant clouds these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity form stars and and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars during supernovae the big bang theory offers comprehensive explanation for broad range observed including the abundance light the cosmic

only probe far into high energy regimes consequently the state the universe the earliest instants the big bang expansion poorly understood and still area open the big bang theory does not provide any explanation for the initial conditions the rather describes and explains the general evolution the universe going forward from that point georges tre first proposed what became the big bang theory over scientists built his initial ideas cosmic expansion and that this expansion could traced back the cosmic origin form the modern the framework for the big bang model relies albert einstein general

measurements strongly supports the cdm model that describes detail the contents the inflation and baryogenesis cosmic inflation baryogenesis the earliest phases the big bang are subject much the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with incredibly high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and approximately seconds into the phase transition caused cosmic inflation during which the universe grew exponentially after inflation the universe consisted quark gluon plasma well all other elementary particles temperatures were high that the random motions particles were relativistic speeds and particle antiparticle pairs all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed some point unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation baryon number leading very small excess quarks and leptons over antiquarks and the order one part this resulted the predominance matter over antimatter the present cooling big bang nucleosynthesis cosmic microwave background radiation infrared redshift the universe continued decrease density and fall hence the typical energy each particle was symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces physics and the parameters elementary particles into their present after about seconds the picture becomes less since particle energies drop values that can attained particle physics experiments about seconds quarks and gluons combined form baryons such protons and the small excess quarks over antiquarks led small excess baryons over the temperature was now longer high enough create new antiproton pairs similarly for mass annihilation immediately leaving just one the original protons and and none their similar process happened about second for electrons and after these the remaining neutrons and electrons were longer moving relativistically and the energy density the universe was dominated photons with minor contribution from neutrinos few minutes into the when the temperature was about billion one thousand prefix giga kelvin and the density was about that neutrons combined with protons form the deuterium and helium nuclei process called big bang nucleosynthesis most protons remained uncombined hydrogen the universe the rest mass energy density matter came gravitationally dominate that the photon radiation after about years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms mostly hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely this relic radiation known the cosmic microwave background radiation structure formation structure formation over long period the slightly denser regions the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even forming gas stars galaxies and the other astronomical structures observable the details this process depend the amount and type matter the the four possible types matter are known cold dark matter warm dark matter hot dark matter and baryonic matter the best measurements available from wmap show that the data fit cdm model which dark matter assumed cold warm dark matter ruled out early reionization and estimated make about the energy the while baryonic matter makes about extended which includes hot dark matter the form neutrinos then the physical baryon estimated about this different from the baryon expressed fraction the total energy which noted above about and the corresponding cold dark matter density about the corresponding neutrino density estimated less than cosmic acceleration accelerating universe abell galaxy cluster hubble frontier fields view independent lines evidence from type supernovae and the cmb imply that the universe today dominated mysterious form energy known dark energy which apparently permeates all the observations suggest the total energy density universe this when the universe was very was likely infused with dark but with less space and everything closer gravity and was slowly braking the but after numerous billion years the growing abundance dark energy caused the expansion the universe slowly begin dark energy its simplest formulation takes the form the cosmological constant term einstein field equations general but its composition and mechanism are unknown more the details its equation state and relationship with the standard model particle physics continue investigated both observationally and all this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can rigorously described and modeled the cdm model which uses the independent frameworks quantum mechanics and general noted there supported model describing the action prior seconds apparently new unified theory quantum gravitation needed break this understanding this earliest eras the history the universe currently one the greatest unsolved problems physics underlying assumptions the big bang theory depends two major the universality physical laws and the cosmological principle the cosmological principle states that large scales the universe homogeneous and isotropic these ideas were initially taken but today there are efforts test each for the first assumption has been tested observations showing that largest possible deviation the fine structure constant over much the age the universe order also general relativity has passed stringent tests the scale the solar system and binary notes the scale universe appears isotropic viewed from the cosmological principle can derived from the simpler copernican principle which states that there preferred observer vantage this the cosmological principle has been confirmed level via observations the notes citation needed the universe has been measured homogeneous the largest scales the level expansion space walker metric metric expansion space general relativity describes spacetime metric which determines the distances that separate nearby the which can stars other themselves are specified using coordinate chart grid that laid down over all spacetime the cosmological principle implies that the metric should homogeneous and isotropic large which uniquely singles out the friedmann walker metric flrw this metric contains scale factor which describes how the size the universe changes with this enables convenient choice coordinate system called comoving coordinates this coordinate system the grid expands along with the and objects that are moving only due the expansion the universe remain fixed points the while their coordinate distance comoving distance remains the physical distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the scale factor the the big bang not explosion matter moving outward fill empty instead space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving because the flrw metric assumes uniform distribution mass and applies our universe only large local concentrations matter such our galaxy are gravitationally bound and such not experience the scale expansion horizons cosmological horizon important feature the big bang spacetime the presence horizons since the universe has finite and light travels finite there may events the past whose light has not had time reach this places limit past horizon the most distant objects that can conversely because space and more distant objects are receding ever more light emitted today may never catch very distant this defines future horizon which limits the events the future that will able the presence either type horizon depends the details the flrw model that describes our our understanding the universe back very early times suggests that there past though practice our view also limited the opacity the universe early our view cannot extend further backward though the horizon recedes the expansion the universe continues accelerate there future horizon history history the big bang theory timeline cosmology etymology english astronomer fred hoyle credited with coining the term big during bbc radio popularly reported that who favored alternative steady state cosmological intended this but hoyle explicitly denied this and said was just striking image meant highlight the difference between the two development hubble extreme deep field xdf moon galaxies stars xdf xdf protogalaxies young stars the big bang theory developed from observations the structure the universe and from theoretical vesto slipher measured the first doppler shift spiral nebula spiral nebula the obsolete term for spiral and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from did not grasp the cosmological implications this and indeed the time was highly controversial whether not these nebulae were island outside our milky way ten years alexander russian cosmologist and mathematician derived the friedmann equations from albert equations general relativity showing that the universe might expanding contrast the static universe model advocated einstein that edwin measurement the great distance the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other independently deriving equations georges tre belgian physicist and roman catholic priest proposed that the inferred recession the nebulae was due the expansion the lema tre went further and suggested that the evident expansion the projected back meant that the further the past the smaller the universe until some finite time the past all the mass the universe was concentrated into single primeval where and when the fabric time and space came into starting hubble painstakingly developed series distance the forerunner the cosmic distance ladder using the inch hooker telescope mount wilson observatory this allowed him estimate distances galaxies whose redshifts had already been mostly hubble discovered correlation between distance and recession now known hubble law lema tre had already shown that this was given the cosmological principle the and almost every major cosmologist preferred eternal steady state universe and several complained that the beginning time implied the big bang imported religious concepts into this objection was later repeated supporters the steady state this perception was enhanced the fact that the originator the big bang monsignor georges was roman catholic arthur eddington agreed with aristotle that the universe did not have beginning viz that matter eternal beginning time was repugnant lema however thought that the world has begun with single quantum the notions space and time would altogether fail have any meaning the they would only begin have sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into sufficient number this suggestion the beginning the world happened little before the beginning space and during the other ideas were proposed non standard cosmologies explain including the milne model the oscillatory universe originally suggested but advocated albert einstein and richard tolman and fritz zwicky tired light hypothesis after world war two distinct possibilities one was fred steady state model whereby new matter would created the universe seemed this model the universe roughly the same any point the other was big bang advocated and developed george gamow who introduced big bang nucleosynthesis and whose ralph alpher and robert herman predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation ironically was hoyle who coined the phrase that came applied referring this big bang idea during bbc radio broadcast march notes for support was split between these two eventually the observational most notably from radio source counts began favor big bang over steady the discovery and confirmation the cosmic microwave background radiation secured the big bang the best theory the origin and evolution the much the current work cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form the context the big understanding the physics the universe earlier and earlier and reconciling observations with the basic significant progress big bang cosmology have been made since the late result advances telescope technology well the analysis data from satellites such cobe the hubble space telescope and wmap cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements many the parameters the big bang and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion the universe appears observational evidence wmap big bang picture too firmly grounded data from every area proved invalid its general lawrence krauss the earliest and most direct observational evidence the validity the theory are the expansion the universe according hubble law indicated the redshifts discovery and measurement the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances light elements produced big bang nucleosynthesis more recent evidence includes observations galaxy formation and evolution and the distribution large scale cosmic structures these are sometimes called the four the big bang precise modern models the big bang appeal various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed terrestrial laboratory experiments incorporated into the standard model particle physics these dark matter currently subjected the most active laboratory remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem cold dark dark energy also area intense interest for but not clear whether direct detection dark energy will inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features current big bang notes citation needed viable quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being these are currently unsolved problems hubble law and the expansion space law metric expansion space distance measures scale factor observations distant galaxies and quasars show that these objects are the light emitted from them has been shifted longer this can seen taking frequency spectrum object and matching the spectroscopic pattern emission lines absorption lines corresponding atoms the chemical elements interacting with the these redshifts are uniformly isotropic distributed evenly among the observed objects all the redshift interpreted doppler the recessional velocity the object can for some possible estimate distances via the cosmic distance ladder when the recessional velocities are plotted against these linear relationship known law where the recessional velocity the galaxy other distant the comoving distance the and hubble constant measured mpc the wmap probe hubble law has two possible either are the center explosion which untenable given the copernican principle the universe uniformly expanding everywhere this universal expansion was predicted from general relativity alexander friedmann and georges tre well before hubble made his analysis and and remains the cornerstone the big bang theory developed friedmann lema robertson and walker the theory requires the relation hold all where the comoving distance the recessional velocity and and vary the universe expands hence write denote the day hubble constant for distances much smaller than the size the observable universe the hubble redshift can thought the doppler shift corresponding the recession velocity however the redshift not true doppler but rather the result the expansion the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that was that space undergoing metric expansion shown direct observational evidence the cosmological principle and the copernican which together with law have other astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous supporting the cosmological principle that the universe looks the same all along with much other the redshifts were the result explosion from center distant from they would not similar different measurements the effects the cosmic microwave background radiation the dynamics distant astrophysical systems proved the copernican that cosmological the earth not central radiation from the big bang was demonstrably warmer earlier times throughout the uniform cooling the cosmic microwave background over billions years explainable only the universe experiencing metric and excludes the possibility that are near the unique center cosmic microwave background radiation cosmic microwave background radiation wmap isotropic arno penzias and robert wilson serendipitously discovered the cosmic background omnidirectional signal the microwave band their discovery provided substantial confirmation the general cmb the radiation was found consistent with almost perfect black body spectrum all this spectrum has been redshifted the expansion the and today corresponds approximately this tipped the balance evidence favor the big bang and penzias and wilson were awarded nobel prize data points error bars the surface last scattering corresponding emission the cmb occurs shortly after recombination the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes prior the universe comprised hot dense baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged peaking around kyr the mean free path for photon becomes long enough reach the present day and the universe becomes nasa launched the cosmic background explorer satellite its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the finding residual temperature more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly and providing the first evidence for fluctuations the level about one part john mather and george smoot were awarded the nobel prize for their leadership this during the following cmb anisotropies were further investigated large number based and balloon several most notably boomerang found the shape the universe spatially almost flat measuring the typical angular size the size the the early the first results the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe were yielding what were the time the most accurate values for some the cosmological the results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models but are consistent with the inflation theory the planck space probe was launched may other ground and balloon based cosmic microwave background experiments are abundance primordial elements big bang nucleosynthesis using the big bang model possible calculate the concentration helium helium deuterium and lithium the universe ratios the amount ordinary the relative abundances depend single the ratio photons this value can calculated independently from the detailed structure cmb fluctuations the ratios predicted not are about for about for about for and about for the measured abundances all agree least roughly with those predicted from single value the photon the agreement excellent for close but formally discrepant for and off factor two the latter two cases there are substantial systematic uncertainties nonetheless the general consistency with abundances predicted big bang nucleosynthesis strong evidence for the big the theory the only known explanation for the relative abundances light and virtually impossible tune the big bang produce much more less than helium indeed there obvious reason outside the big bang for the young universe before star determined studying matter supposedly free stellar nucleosynthesis products should have more helium than deuterium more deuterium than and constant too galactic evolution and distribution galaxy formation and evolution structure formation detailed observations the morphology and distribution galaxies and quasars are agreement with the current state the big bang combination observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about billion years after the big and since then larger structures have been such galaxy clusters and superclusters populations stars have been aging and that distant galaxies which are observed they were the early appear very different from nearby galaxies observed more recent moreover galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed similar distances but shortly after the big these observations are strong arguments against the state observations star formation galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with big bang simulations the formation structure the universe and are helping complete details the primordial gas clouds focal plane telescope gravitational waves astronomers found what they believe pristine clouds primordial analyzing absorption lines the spectra distant before this all other astronomical objects have been observed contain heavy elements that are formed these two clouds gas contain elements heavier than hydrogen and since the clouds gas have heavy they likely formed the first few minutes after the big during big bang nucleosynthesis their composition matches the composition predicted from big bang this provides direct evidence that there was period the history the universe before the formation the first when most ordinary matter existed the form clouds neutral other lines evidence the age universe estimated from the hubble expansion and the cmb now good agreement with other estimates using the ages the oldest both measured applying the theory stellar evolution globular clusters and through radiometric dating individual population stars the prediction that the cmb temperature was higher the past has been experimentally supported observations very low temperature absorption lines gas clouds high this prediction also implies that the amplitude the sunyaev dovich effect clusters galaxies does not depend directly observations have found this roughly but this effect depends cluster properties that change with cosmic making precise measurements march astronomers the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics announced the apparent detection primordial gravitational waves which may provide strong evidence for inflation and the big however june lowered confidence confirming the findings was related issues physics baryon asymmetry baryon asymmetry not yet understood why the universe has more matter than generally assumed that when the universe was young and very was statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers baryons and however observations suggest that the including its most distant made almost entirely process called baryogenesis was hypothesized account for the for baryogenesis the sakharov conditions must these require that baryon number not that symmetry and symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium all these conditions occur the standard model but the effect not strong enough explain the present baryon dark energy dark energy measurements the redshift magnitude relation for type supernovae indicate that the expansion the universe has been accelerating since the universe was about half its present explain this general relativity requires that much the energy the universe consists component with large negative pressure dubbed dark dark though solves numerous measurements the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe very nearly spatially and therefore according general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the critical density but the mass density the universe can measured from its gravitational and found have only about the critical since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster the usual way the best explanation for the missing energy dark energy also helps explain two geometrical measures the overall curvature the one using the frequency gravitational lenses and the other using the characteristic pattern the large scale structure cosmic negative pressure believed property vacuum energy but the exact nature and existence dark energy remains one the great mysteries the big possible candidates include cosmological constant and quintessence results from the wmap team are accordance with universe that consists dark dark regular matter and less than neutrinos according the energy density matter decreases with the expansion the but the dark energy density remains constant nearly the universe therefore matter made larger fraction the total energy the universe the past than does but its fractional contribution will fall the far future dark energy becomes even more dark matter dark matter chart dark matter dark energy during the and various observations showed that there not sufficient visible matter the universe account for the apparent strength gravitational forces within and between this led the idea that the matter the universe dark matter that does not emit light interact with normal baryonic matter the assumption that the universe mostly normal matter led predictions that were strongly inconsistent with the universe today far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can accounted for without dark while dark matter has always been inferred various the anisotropies the galaxy cluster velocity large scale structure gravitational lensing studies and ray measurements galaxy indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence other dark matter particles have been observed many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been and several projects detect them directly are globular cluster age age crisis the observations globular clusters appeared inconsistent with the big bang computer simulations that matched the observations the stellar populations globular clusters suggested that they were about billion years which conflicted with the billion year age the this issue was partially resolved the late when new computer which included the effects mass loss due stellar winds indicated much younger age for globular there remain some questions how accurately the ages the clusters are but clear that observations globular clusters longer appear inconsistent with the big bang problems there are generally considered three outstanding problems with the big bang the horizon problem the flatness problem and the magnetic monopole problem the most common answer these problems inflationary theory however since this creates new other options have been such the weyl curvature hypothesis horizon problem horizon problem the horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel faster than light universe finite age this sets the particle horizon the separation any two regions space that are causal contact the observed isotropy the cmb problematic this the universe had been dominated radiation matter all times the epoch last the particle horizon that time would correspond about degrees the there would then mechanism cause wider regions have the same resolution this apparent inconsistency offered inflationary theory which homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe some very early period before during the universe undergoes exponential and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously that regions presently opposite sides the observable universe are well inside each particle the observed isotropy the cmb then follows from the fact that this larger region was causal contact before the beginning heisenberg uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would quantum thermal fluctuations which would magnified cosmic these fluctuations serve the seeds all current structure the inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and gaussian which has been accurately confirmed measurements the inflation exponential expansion would push large regions space well beyond our observable flatness problem flatness problem geometry the universe omega cosmological parameter closed universe hyperbolic universe flat universe the flatness problem also known the oldness observational problem associated with friedmann walker metric the universe may have negative zero spatial curvature depending its total energy curvature negative its density less than the critical density positive and zero the critical which case space said flat the problem that any small departure from the critical density grows with and yet the universe today remains very close notes given that natural timescale for departure from flatness might the planck time seconds the fact that the universe has reached neither heat death nor big crunch after billions years requires for even the relatively late age few minutes the time the universe density must have been within one part its critical would not exist does resolution this problem offered inflationary during the inflationary spacetime expanded such extent that its curvature would have been smoothed thus theorized that inflation drove the universe very nearly spatially flat with almost exactly the critical citation needed magnetic monopoles magnetic monopole the magnetic monopole objection was raised the late grand unification theories predicted topological defects space that would manifest magnetic monopoles these objects would produced efficiently the hot early resulting density much higher than consistent with given that monopoles have been this problem also resolved cosmic inflation which removes all point defects from the observable the same way that drives the geometry the future according the big bang theory ultimate fate the universe before observations dark cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future the the mass density the universe were greater than the critical density then the universe would reach maximum size and then begin would become denser and hotter ending with state similar that which big alternatively the density the universe were equal below the critical the expansion would slow down but never star formation would cease with the consumption interstellar gas each stars would burn out leaving white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes very collisions between these would result mass accumulating into larger and larger black the average temperature the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero big freeze moreover the proton were unstable then baryonic matter would leaving only radiation and black eventually black holes would evaporate emitting hawking radiation the entropy the universe would increase the point where organized form energy could extracted from scenario known heat modern observations accelerating expansion imply that more and more the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out contact with the eventual result not the cdm model the universe contains dark energy the form cosmological constant this theory suggests that only gravitationally bound such will remain and they too will subject heat death the universe expands and other explanations dark called phantom energy theories suggest that ultimately galaxy stars planets atoms nuclei and matter itself will torn apart the increasing expansion called big rip speculative physics beyond the big bang theory metric expansion space wmap while the big bang model well established likely the equations classical general relativity indicate singularity the origin cosmic although this conclusion depends several assumptions and the equations break down any time before the universe reached the planck temperature correct treatment quantum gravity may avoid the not known what could have caused the singularity come into existence had how and why though speculation abounds the field cosmogony some each which entails untested are models including the hartle hawking boundary condition which the whole time the big bang does represent the limit time but without the need for big bang lattice states that the universe the moment the big bang consists infinite lattice fermions which smeared over the fundamental domain has translational and gauge the

anisotropy level due the peculiar velocity the solar system through the radiation commonly reported that hoyle intended this however hoyle later denied saying that was just striking image meant emphasize the difference between the two theories for radio inflation baryogenesis must have but not vice strictly dark energy the form cosmological constant drives the universe towards flat however
