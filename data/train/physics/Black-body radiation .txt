thermodynamic equilibrium state cavity each fourier mode the equilibrium radiation otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls considered degree freedom capable exchanging then according the equipartition theorem classical there would equal amount energy each since there are infinite number modes this implies infinite heat capacity infinite energy any zero well unphysical spectrum

agreement with experimental observation and resolving the the study the laws black bodies and the failure classical physics describe them helped establish the foundations quantum mechanics explanation all normal baryonic matter emits electromagnetic radiation when has temperature above absolute zero the radiation represents conversion thermal energy into electromagnetic and therefore called thermal radiation spontaneous process radiative distribution entropy conversely all normal matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation some object that absorbs all radiation falling all wavelengths called black when black body uniform its emission has characteristic frequency distribution that depends the its emission called body the concept the black body perfect black bodies not exist graphite and lamp black with emissivities greater than however are good approximations black experimentally black body radiation may established best the ultimately stable steady state equilibrium radiation cavity rigid uniform that entirely opaque and only partly closed box graphite walls constant temperature with small hole one side produces good approximation ideal body radiation emanating from the black body radiation has the unique absolutely stable distribution radiative intensity that can persist thermodynamic equilibrium for each frequency the total intensity radiation that emitted and reflected

the hoehoe two bodies that are the same temperature stay thermal body temperature surrounded cloud light temperature average will emit much light into the cloud following exchange which refers radiative equilibrium the principle detailed balance says that thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally its forward and backward prevost also showed that the emission from body logically determined solely its own internal the causal effect thermodynamic absorption thermodynamic emission not but only indirect affects the internal state the this means that thermodynamic equilibrium the amount every wavelength every direction thermal radiation emitted body temperature black equal the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because surrounded light temperature when the body the absorption the amount light absorbed all the light that hits the for black body much bigger than the the light energy absorbed any wavelength per unit time strictly proportional the body this means that the body curve the amount light energy emitted black which justifies the this the condition for the applicability kirchhoff law thermal radiation the body curve characteristic thermal which depends only the temperature the walls the provided that the walls the cavity are completely opaque and are not very and that the cavity thermodynamic equilibrium when the black body that its size comparable the wavelength the absorption because small object not efficient absorber light long but the principle strict equality emission and absorption always upheld condition thermodynamic the black body radiation approximated the radiation from small hole large hohlraum entirely opaque body that only partly that maintained constant this technique leads the alternative term cavity radiation any light entering the hole would have reflect off the walls the cavity multiple times before which process nearly certain absorption occurs regardless the wavelength the radiation entering long small compared the the then close approximation theoretical black body the cavity the spectrum the radiation the amount light emitted from the hole each will and will depend only the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and least partly but not the particular material which they are built nor the material the cavity compare with emission spectrum calculating the body curve was major challenge theoretical physics during the late nineteenth the problem was solved max planck the formalism now known planck law body making changes wien radiation law not confused with wien displacement law consistent with thermodynamics and electromagnetism found mathematical expression fitting the experimental data planck had assume that the energy the oscillators the cavity was existed integer multiples some einstein built this idea and proposed the quantization electromagnetic radiation itself explain the photoelectric effect these theoretical advances eventually resulted the superseding classical electromagnetism quantum electrodynamics these quanta were called photons and the body cavity was thought containing gas photons led the development quantum probability called fermi dirac statistics and bose einstein statistics each applicable different class fermions and bosons the wavelength which the radiation strongest given displacement and the overall power emitted per unit area given the stefan boltzmann law temperature the glow color changes from red yellow white even the peak wavelength moves into the enough radiation continues emitted the blue wavelengths that the body will continue appear will never become the radiation visible light increases monotonically with the radiance observed intensity not function therefore black body perfect lambertian radiator real objects never behave ideal black and instead the emitted radiation given frequency fraction what the ideal emission would the emissivity material specifies how well real body radiates energy compared with black this emissivity depends factors such emission and however typical engineering assume that spectral emissivity and absorptivity not depend that the emissivity this known the gray body assumption wmap cosmic microwave background radiation with black the deviations from ideal body behavior are determined both the surface such roughness and the chemical per basis real objects states local thermodynamic equilibrium still follow kirchhoff law emissivity equals that object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than ideal black the incomplete absorption can due some the incident light being transmitted through the body some being reflected the surface the astronomy objects such stars are frequently regarded black though this often poor almost perfect body spectrum exhibited the cosmic microwave background radiation hawking radiation the hypothetical body radiation emitted black holes temperature that depends the charge and spin the this prediction black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time they lose mass the emission photons and other black body radiates energy all but its intensity rapidly tends zero high frequencies short for black body room temperature with one square meter surface area will emit photon the visible range average rate one photon every seconds meaning that for most practical such black body does not emit the visible equations planck law body radiation planck law law states that where energy time power normal solid angle frequency planck constant speed light boltzmann constant

only the temperature where the known displacement equal planck law was also stated above function the intensity maximum for this given stefan boltzmann law the stefan boltzmann law states that the power emitted per unit area the surface black body directly proportional the fourth power its absolute where the total power radiated per unit the absolute temperature and the stefan boltzmann

negligible the nusselt number much greater than evaporation via perspiration only required radiation and convection are insufficient maintain steady state temperature but evaporation from the lungs occurs citation needed free convection rates are albeit somewhat than radiative thus radiation accounts for about thirds thermal energy loss still given the approximate nature many the this can only taken crude ambient air causing forced evaporation reduces the relative importance radiation thermal loss application wien law human body emission results peak wavelength for this thermal imaging devices for human subjects are most sensitive the micron temperature relation between planet and its star the body law may used estimate the temperature planet orbiting the radiation the temperature planet depends several incident radiation from its star emitted radiation the earth infrared glow the albedo effect causing fraction light reflected the planet the greenhouse effect for planets with atmosphere energy generated internally planet itself due radioactive decay tidal heating and adiabatic contraction due cooling the analysis only considers the heat for planet solar the stefan boltzmann law gives the total power the sun where boltzmann constant the sun emits that power equally all because the planet hit with only tiny fraction the power from the sun that strikes the planet the top the where astronomical unit sun because its high the sun emits large extent the ultraviolet and visible frequency this frequency the planet reflects fraction this energy where the albedo reflectance the planet the vis other the planet absorbs fraction the and reflects the the power absorbed the planet and its atmosphere even though the planet only absorbs circular area emits equally all directions the planet were perfect black would emit according the stefan boltzmann law where the temperature the this calculated for the case the planet acting black body setting known the effective temperature the actual temperature the planet will likely depending its surface and atmospheric ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse the since much lower temperature than the emits mostly the infrared portion the this frequency emits the radiation that black body would emit where the average emissivity the the power emitted the planet for body radiative exchange equilibrium with its

greenhouse other given the assumptions the temperature planet depends only the surface temperature the the radius the the distance between the planet and the the albedo and the emissivity the temperature earth substituting the measured values for the sun and earth with the average emissivity set the effective temperature the earth this the temperature the earth radiated perfect black body the ignoring greenhouse effects which can raise the surface temperature body above what would were perfect black body all spectrums and assuming unchanging the earth fact radiates not quite perfect black body the infrared which will raise the estimated temperature few degrees above the effective wish estimate what the temperature the earth would had then could take the albedo and emissivity the moon good the albedo and emissivity the moon are about and respectively yielding estimated temperature about estimates the average albedo vary the range resulting different estimated effective estimates are often based the solar constant total insolation power rather than the size and distance the for using for and insolation one obtains effective temperature about similarly using albedo and solar constant one obtains effective temperature cosmology the cosmic microwave background radiation observed today the most perfect body radiation ever observed with temperature about snapshot the radiation the time decoupling between matter and radiation the early prior this most matter the universe was the form ionized plasma thermal equilibrium with according kondepudi and very high temperatures above such temperatures existed the very early where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons spite the strong nuclear electron positron pairs appear and disappear spontanteously and are thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic these particles form part the black body addition the electromagnetic doppler effect for moving black body the relativistic doppler effect causes shift the frequency light originating from source that moving relation the that the wave observed have frequency where the velocity the source the rest the angle between the velocity vector and the source direction measured the reference frame the and the speed light this can simplified for the special cases objects moving directly towards away from the and for speeds much less than through law the temperature spectrum black body proportionally related the frequency light and one may substitute the temperature for the frequency this for the case source moving directly towards away from the this reduces here indicates receding and indicates approaching this important effect where the velocities stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions example found the cosmic microwave background radiation which exhibits dipole anisotropy from the motion relative this body radiation history balfour stewart balfour stewart described his experiments the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers polished plates various compared with the powers black the same stewart chose black surfaces his reference because various previous experimental especially those pierre prevost and john leslie wrote which absorbs all the rays that fall upon and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing will possess also the greatest possible radiating more experimenter than stewart failed point out that his statement presupposed abstract general that there exist either ideally theory really nature bodies surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing likewise for radiating for every wavelength and equilibrium stewart measured radiated power with pile and sensitive galvanometer read with was concerned with selective thermal which investigated with plates substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities radiation rather than maximally for all qualities discussed the experiments terms rays which could reflected and and which obeyed the helmholtz reciprocity principle though did not use eponym for did not this paper mention that the qualities the rays might described their nor did use spectrally resolving apparatus such prisms diffraction his work was quantitative within these made his measurements room temperature and quickly catch his bodies condition near the thermal equilibrium which they had been prepared heating equilibrium with boiling his measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle selective equality emission and absorption thermal stewart offered theoretical proof that this should the case separately for every selected quality thermal but his mathematics was not rigorously made mention thermodynamics this though did refer conservation vis viva proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted particles matter throughout depths the media which applied the helmholtz reciprocity principle account for the material interface processes distinct from the processes the interior did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black concluded that his experiments showed that cavity thermal the heat radiated from any part the interior bounding matter what material might was the same would have been emitted from surface the same shape and position that would have been composed did not state explicitly that the coated bodies that used reference must have had unique common spectral emittance function that depended temperature unique gustav kirchhoff not knowing gustav robert kirchhoff reported the coincidence the wavelengths spectrally resolved lines absorption and emission visible importantly for thermal also observed that bright lines dark lines were apparent depending the temperature difference between emitter and kirchhoff then went consider bodies that emit and absorb heat opaque enclosure equilibrium temperature here used notation different from here the emitting power denotes dimensioned the total radiation emitted body labeled index temperature the total absorption ratio that body the ratio absorbed incident radiation the cavity temperature contrast with balfour kirchhoff definition his absorption ratio did not refer particular black surface the source the incident thus the ratio emitting power absorption ratio dimensioned with the dimensions emitting because also here the specific emitting power the body temperature denoted and the specific absorption ratio again the ratio emitting power absorption ratio dimensioned with the dimensions emitting second report made kirchhoff announced new general principle law for which offered theoretical and mathematical though did not offer quantitative measurements radiation his theoretical proof was and still considered some writers his however has was that for heat rays the same equilibrium given the specific ratio emitting power absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb that the law stated that the specific ratio has one and the same value for all that for all values index this report there was mention black still not knowing measurements for selected qualities kirchhoff pointed out that was long established experimentally that for total heat unselected emitted and absorbed body the dimensioned total radiation ratio has one and the same value common all that for every value the material index again without measurements radiative powers other new experimental kirchhoff then offered fresh theoretical proof his new principle the universality the value the specific ratio thermal his fresh theoretical proof was and still considered some writers but more relied new theoretical postulate perfectly black which the reason why one speaks such black bodies showed complete absorption their infinitely thin most superficial they correspond balfour reference with internal coated with they were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered planck black bodies radiated and absorbed only the material their their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical capable neither absorption nor but only reflecting and transmitting with kirchhoff proof considered arbitrary ideal body labeled well various perfect black bodies labeled required that the bodies kept cavity thermal equilibrium temperature his proof intended show that the ratio was independent the nature the ideal however partly transparent partly reflective his proof first argued that for wavelength and temperature thermal all perfectly black bodies the same size and shape have the one and the same common value emissive power with the dimensions his proof noted that the dimensionless specific absorption ratio perfectly black body definition exactly then for perfectly black the specific ratio emissive power absorption ratio again just with the dimensions kirchhoff successively thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary ideal and with perfectly black body the same size and place his cavity equilibrium temperature argued that the flows heat radiation must the same each thus argued that thermal equilibrium the ratio was equal which may now denoted continuous dependent only fixed temperature and increasing function fixed wavelength low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer with positive values for visible wavelengths higher which does not depend the nature the arbitrary ideal geometrical taken into detailed account have been ignored the thus kirchhoff law thermal radiation can for any material radiating and absorbing thermodynamic equilibrium any given temperature for every wavelength the ratio emissive power absorptive ratio has one universal which characteristic perfect black and emissive power which here represent for our notation kirchhoff original notation was simply kirchhoff announced that the determination the function was problem the highest though recognized that there would experimental difficulties supposed that like other functions that not depend the properties individual would simple occasionally historians that function has been called universal function though its precise mathematical form would not known for another forty till was discovered planck the theoretical proof for universality principle was worked and debated various physicists over the same and kirchhoff stated later that his theoretical proof was better than balfour and some respects was kirchhoff paper did not mention the second law and course did not mention the concept entropy which had not that time been more considered account book kirchhoff mentioned the connection his law with carnot principle which form the second according helge quantum theory owes its origin the study thermal
