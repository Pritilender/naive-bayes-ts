branches physics navigation search classical physics modern physics outline physics physics deals with the combination matter and also deals with wide variety about which theories have been developed that are used theories are experimentally tested numerous times before they are accepted correct description nature within certain domain for the theory classical mechanics accurately describes the motion provided they are much larger than atoms and moving much less than the speed light these theories continue areas active for remarkable aspect classical mechanics known chaos was discovered the three centuries after the original formulation classical mechanics isaac newton these central are important tools for research more specialized and any regardless his her expected literate contents classical mechanics thermodynamics and statistical mechanics electromagnetism relativity quantum mechanics interdisciplinary fields summary references classical mechanics classical mechanics model the physics forces acting upon often referred newtonian after isaac newton and his laws motion also includes classical approach give hamiltonian and lagrange thermodynamics and statistical mechanics thermodynamics statistical mechanics the first chapter the feynman lectures physics about the existence atoms which feynman considered the most compact statement from which science could easily result even all other knowledge was modeling matter collections hard possible describe the kinetic theory gases upon which classical thermodynamics thermodynamics studies the effects changes temperature pressure and volume physical systems the macroscopic scale and the transfer energy heat historically thermodynamics developed out the desire increase the efficiency early steam engines the starting point for most thermodynamic considerations the laws thermodynamics which postulate that energy can exchanged between physical systems heat work they also postulate the existence quantity named entropy which can defined for any interactions between large ensembles objects are studied and central this are the concepts system and surroundings system composed whose average motions define its which turn are related one another through equations state properties can combined express internal energy and thermodynamic potentials which are useful for determining conditions for equilibrium and spontaneous processes electromagnetism maxwell equations electromagnetism electromagnetism optics relativity special relativity general relativity the special theory relativity enjoys relationship with electromagnetism and that the principle relativity and the principle stationary action mechanics can used derive maxwell equations and vice versa the theory special relativity was proposed albert einstein his article the electrodynamics moving bodies the title the article refers the fact that special relativity resolves inconsistency between maxwell equations and classical the theory based two postulates that the mathematical forms the laws physics are invariant all inertial systems and that the speed light vacuum constant and independent the source reconciling the two postulates requires unification space and time into the dependent concept spacetime general relativity the geometrical theory gravitation published albert einstein unifies special newton law universal gravitation and the insight that gravitation can described the curvature space and general the curvature spacetime produced the energy matter and quantum mechanics quantum mechanics hydrogen atom electron orbitals probability density dinger equation quantum mechanics quantum mechanics the branch physics treating atomic and subatomic systems and their interaction with radiation based the observation that all forms energy are released discrete units bundles called quanta remarkably quantum theory typically permits only probable statistical calculation the observed features subatomic understood terms wave functions the schr dinger equation plays the role quantum mechanics that newton laws and conservation energy serve classical predicts the future behavior dynamic system and wave equation that used solve for for the electromagnetic radiation emitted absorbed atom has only certain frequencies wavelengths can seen from the line spectrum associated with the chemical element represented that the quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond definite energies the light photons and result from the fact that the electrons the atom can have only certain allowed energy when electron changes from one allowed level quantum energy emitted absorbed whose frequency directly proportional the energy difference between the two the photoelectric effect further confirmed the quantization louis broglie proposed that not only light waves sometimes exhibit like but particles may also exhibit like two different formulations quantum mechanics were presented following the wave mechanics erwin dinger involves the use mathematical the wave which related the probability finding particle given point the matrix mechanics werner heisenberg makes mention wave functions similar concepts but was shown mathematically equivalent particularly important discovery the quantum theory the uncertainty principle enunciated heisenberg which places absolute theoretical limit the accuracy certain the assumption earlier scientists that the physical state system could measured exactly and used predict future states had quantum mechanics was combined with the theory relativity the formulation paul
