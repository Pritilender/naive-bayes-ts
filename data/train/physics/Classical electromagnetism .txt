extension the classical newtonian model the theory provides excellent description electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are for small distances and low field such interactions are better described quantum electrodynamics fundamental physical aspects classical electrodynamics are presented many such those leighton and panofsky and and contents history lorentz force the electric field electromagnetic waves general field equations models see also references external links history history electromagnetism the physical phenomena that electromagnetism describes have been studied separate fields since for there were many advances the field optics centuries before light was understood electromagnetic however the theory electromagnetism currently emerged unified field over the course the most prominently set equations systemized james clerk maxwell for detailed historical consult whittaker and lorentz force lorentz force the electromagnetic field exerts the following force often called the lorentz charged particles where all boldfaced quantities are vectors the force that charge experiences the electric field the location the the velocity the the magnetic field the location the the above equation illustrates that the lorentz force the sum two one the cross product the velocity and magnetic field based the properties the cross this produces vector that perpendicular both the velocity and magnetic field the other vector the same direction the electric the sum these two vectors the lorentz therefore the absence magnetic the force the direction the electric and the magnitude the force dependent the value the charge and the intensity the electric the absence electric the force perpendicular the velocity the particle and the direction the magnetic both electric and magnetic fields are the lorentz force the sum both these the electric field electric field the electric field defined such stationary where what known test the size the charge really long small enough not influence the electric field its mere what plain from this though that the unit newtons per coulomb this unit equal volts per see where charges are not around distribution point the forces determined from coulomb law may the result after dividing where the number the amount charge associated with the the position the the position where the electric field being and the electric constant the field instead produced continuous distribution the summation becomes where the charge density and the vector that points from the volume element the point space where being both the above equations are especially one wants determine function scalar function called the electric potential can electric also called voltage the units for which are the defined the line integral where the electric and the path over which the integral being unfortunately this definition has from maxwell equations clear that not always and hence the scalar potential alone insufficient define the electric field one must add correction which generally done subtracting the time derivative the vector potential described whenever the charges are however this condition will essentially from the definition one can easily show that the electric potential point charge function position where the point the position which the potential being and the position each point the potential for continuous distribution charge where the charge and the distance from the volume element point space where being the scalar will add other potentials this makes relatively easy break complex problems down simple parts and add their taking the definition backwards see that the electric field just the negative gradient the del operator the from this formula clear that can expressed volts per electromagnetic waves electromagnetic waves changing electromagnetic field propagates away from its origin the form wave these waves travel vacuum the speed light and exist wide spectrum wavelengths examples the dynamic fields electromagnetic radiation order increasing radio waves microwaves light infrared visible light and ultraviolet rays and gamma rays the field particle physics this electromagnetic radiation the manifestation the electromagnetic interaction between charged general field equations jefimenko equations wiechert potential simple and satisfying equation may not entirely correct the context classical problems arise because changes charge distributions require zero amount time felt elsewhere required special for the fields general charge the retarded potentials can computed and differentiated accordingly yield jefimenko equations retarded potentials can also derived for point and the equations are known the wiechert potentials the scalar potential where the point charge and the and are the position and velocity the respectively function retarded time the vector potential these can then differentiated accordingly obtain the complete field equations for moving point models branches classical electromagnetism such electrical and electronic engineering consist collection
