topology the vacuum manifold associated this symmetry breaking was not simply connected expected that least one string per hubble volume their existence was first contemplated the theoretical physicist tom kibble the the formation cosmic strings somewhat analogous the imperfections that form between crystal grains solidifying the cracks that form when water freezes into the phase transitions leading the production cosmic strings are likely have occurred during the earliest moments the just after cosmological inflation and are fairly generic prediction both quantum field theory and string theory models the early universe contents theories containing cosmic strings dimensions gravitation negative mass cosmic string observational evidence string theory and cosmic strings see also references external links theories containing cosmic strings string theory the role cosmic strings can played the fundamental strings themselves that define the theory perturbatively strings which are related the strings strong called duality dimensional branes that are partially wrapped compact cycles associated extra spacetime dimensions that only one compact dimension the prototypical example quantum field theory with cosmic strings the abelian higgs model the quantum field theory and string theory cosmic strings are expected have many properties but more research needed determine the precise distinguishing the strings for instance are fully mechanical and not have classical whereas the field theory cosmic strings are almost exclusively treated dimensions cosmic they would extremely thin with diameters the same order magnitude that given that this scale much smaller than any cosmological scale these strings are often studied the zero goto under this assumption strings behave dimensional objects and obey the nambu goto action which classically equivalent the polyakov action that defines the bosonic sector superstring theory field the string width set the scale the symmetry breaking phase string the string width set the simplest the fundamental string warp factors associated the spacetime curvature internal dimensional spacetime and the size internal compact dimensions string the universe either depending the strength interactions and the curvature gravitation string geometrical deviation from euclidean geometry spacetime characterized angular circle around the outside string would comprise total angle less than from the general theory relativity such geometrical defect must and would manifested even though cosmic strings are thought extremely they would have immense and would represent significant gravitational wave cosmic string about kilometer length may more massive than the however general relativity predicts that the gravitational potential straight string there gravitational force static surrounding the only gravitational effect straight cosmic string relative deflection matter passing the string opposite sides purely topological closed cosmic string gravitates more conventional during the expansion the cosmic strings would form network and the past was thought that their gravity could have been responsible for the original clumping matter into galactic superclusters now calculated that their contribution the structure formation the universe less than negative mass cosmic string the standard model cosmic string geometrical structure with angle which thus tension and hence has positive visser proposed that cosmic string could theoretically also exist with angle and thus negative tension and hence negative mass the stability such exotic matter string however they suggested that negative mass string were wrapped around wormhole the early such wormhole could stabilized sufficiently exist the present observational evidence was once thought that the gravitational influence cosmic strings might contribute the large scale clumping matter the but all that known today through galaxy surveys and precision measurements the cosmic microwave background fits evolution out gaussian fluctuations these precise observations therefore tend rule out significant role for cosmic strings and currently known that the contribution cosmic strings the cmb cannot more than the violent oscillations cosmic strings generically lead the formation cusps and kinks these turn cause parts the string pinch off into isolated these loops have finite lifespan and decay via gravitational radiation this radiation which leads the strongest signal from cosmic strings may turn detectable gravitational wave such ligo and important open question what extent the pinched off loops backreact change the initial state the emitting cosmic such backreaction effects are almost always neglected computations and are known even for order magnitude gravitational lensing galaxy straight section cosmic string would produce two undistorted images the group led mikhail sazhin reported the accidental discovery two seemingly identical galaxies very close together the leading speculation that cosmic string had been however observations the hubble space telescope january showed them pair similar not two images the same cosmic string would produce similar duplicate image fluctuations the cosmic microwave background which might detectable the planck surveyor mission analysis data from planck mission failed find any evidence cosmic strings second piece evidence supporting cosmic string theory phenomenon observed observations the double quasar called originally discovered dennis walsh bob carswell and ray weymann the double image this quasar caused galaxy positioned between and the the gravitational lens effect this intermediate galaxy bends the light that follows two paths different lengths the result that see two images the same one arriving short time after the other about days however team astronomers the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics led rudolph schild studied the quasar and found that during the period between september and july the two images appeared have time changes the brightness the two images occurred simultaneously four separate schild and his team believe that the only explanation for this observation that cosmic string passed between the earth and the quasar during that time period traveling very high speed and oscillating with period about days the earthbound laser interferometer wave observatory and especially the based gravitational wave detector laser interferometer space antenna will search for gravitational waves and are likely sensitive enough detect signals from cosmic provided the relevant cosmic string tensions are not too string theory and cosmic strings during the early days string theory both string theorists and cosmic string theorists believed that there was direct connection between superstrings and cosmic strings the names were chosen independently analogy with ordinary string the possibility cosmic strings being produced the early universe was first envisioned quantum field theorist tom kibble and this sprouted the first flurry interest the during the first superstring revolution edward witten contemplated the possibility fundamental superstrings having been produced the early universe and stretched macroscopic which case following the nomenclature tom they would then referred cosmic concluded that had they been produced they would have either disintegrated into smaller strings before ever reaching macroscopic scales the case type superstring theory they would always appear boundaries domain walls whose tension would force the strings collapse rather than grow cosmic scales the context heterotic superstring theory having characteristic energy scale close the planck energy they would produced before cosmological inflation and hence diluted away with the expansion the universe and not much has changed since these early primarily due the second superstring revolution now known that string theory addition the fundamental strings which define the theory perturbatively also contains other dimensional such and dimensional objects such branes and branes partially wrapped compact internal spacetime while being spatially extended one compact the possibility large compact dimensions and large warp factors allows strings with tension much lower than the planck furthermore various dualities that have been discovered point the conclusion that actually all these apparently different types string are just the same object appears different regions parameter these new developments have largely revived interest cosmic starting the early henry tye and collaborators predicted the production cosmic superstrings during the last stages brane inflation string theory construction the early universe that gives leads expanding universe and cosmological was subsequently realized string theorist joseph polchinski that the expanding universe could have stretched fundamental string the sort which superstring theory until was intergalactic such stretched string would exhibit many the properties the old cosmic string making the older calculations useful theorist tom kibble remarks string theory cosmologists have discovered cosmic strings lurking everywhere the older proposals for detecting cosmic strings could now used investigate superstring superstrings strings the other stringy objects mentioned above stretched intergalactic scales would radiate gravitational which could detected using experiments like ligo and especially the based gravitational wave experiment they might also cause slight irregularities the cosmic microwave too subtle have been detected yet but possibly within the realm future note that most these proposals however the appropriate cosmological fundamentals branes etc and convincing experimental verification these has been confirmed cosmic strings nevertheless provide window into string cosmic strings are observed which real possibility for wide range cosmological string models this would provide the first experimental evidence string theory model underlying the structure see also dimensional topological magnetic monopole dimensional topological
