universe dark energy the most accepted hypothesis explain the observations since the indicating that the universe expanding accelerating rate according the planck mission team and based the standard model cosmology mass energy equivalence basis the universe contains dark matter dark energy for total and ordinary matter again energy equivalence the density dark energy very the solar estimated only tons dark energy would found within the radius however comes dominate the energy the universe because uniform across two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant constant energy density filling space and scalar fields such quintessence moduli dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary time and contributions from scalar fields that are constant space are usually also included the cosmological the cosmological constant can formulated equivalent vacuum energy scalar fields that change space can difficult distinguish from cosmological constant because the change may extremely high precision measurements the expansion the universe are required understand how the expansion rate changes over general relativity the evolution the expansion rate parameterized the

for the fate the universe history discovery and previous speculation see also references external links nature dark energy many things about the nature dark energy remain matters the evidence for dark energy indirect but comes from three independent distance measurements and their relation which suggest the universe has expanded more the last half its the theoretical need for type additional energy that not matter dark matter form the observationally flat universe absence any detectable global can inferred from measures large scale patterns mass density the dark energy thought very homogeneous not very dense and not known interact through any the fundamental forces other than gravity since quite roughly unlikely detectable laboratory dark energy can have such profound effect the making universal only because uniformly fills otherwise empty the two leading models are cosmological constant and quintessence both models include the common characteristic that dark energy must have negative effect dark small constant negative pressure vacuum independently its actual dark energy would need have strong negative pressure acting order explain the observed acceleration the expansion the universe according general the pressure within substance contributes its gravitational attraction for other things just its mass density this happens because the physical quantity that causes matter generate gravitational effects the stress energy tensor which contains both the energy density substance and its pressure and the friedmann walker metric can shown that strong constant negative pressure all the universe causes acceleration universe expansion the universe already deceleration universe contraction the universe already more the second derivative the universe scale positive the equation state the universe such that see friedmann equations this accelerating expansion effect sometimes labeled gravitational which colorful but possibly confusing fact negative pressure does not influence the gravitational interaction between which remains but rather alters the overall evolution the universe the cosmological typically resulting the accelerating expansion the universe despite the attraction among the masses present the the acceleration simply function dark energy dark energy its density remains constant within factor does not get diluted when space evidence existence supernovae published observations type supernovae the high supernova search team followed the supernova cosmology project suggested that the expansion the universe accelerating the nobel prize physics was awarded saul perlmutter brian schmidt and adam riess for this since these observations have been corroborated several independent measurements the cosmic microwave background gravitational lensing and the large scale structure the cosmos well improved measurements supernovae have been consistent with the lambda cdm model some people argue that the only indication for the existence dark energy observations distance measurements and associated cosmic microwave background anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations are only observations that redshifts are larger than expected from dusty friedmann tre universe and the local measured hubble supernovae are useful for cosmology because they are excellent standard candles across cosmological they allow the expansion history the universe measured looking the relationship between the distance object and its redshift which gives how fast receding from the relationship roughly according hubble law relatively easy measure but finding the distance object more usually astronomers use standard objects for which the intrinsic the absolute magnitude this allows the distance measured from its actual observed apparent magnitude type supernovae are the known standard candles across cosmological distances because their extreme and extremely consistent recent observations supernovae are consistent with universe made dark energy and combination dark matter and baryonic matter cosmic microwave background matter energy the existence dark whatever needed reconcile the measured geometry space with the total amount matter the measurements cosmic microwave background anisotropies indicate that the universe close flat for the shape the universe the energy density the universe must equal the critical density the total amount matter the universe including baryons and dark matter measured from the cmb accounts for only about the critical this implies the existence additional form energy account for the remaining the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe spacecraft seven year analysis estimated universe made dark dark matter and ordinary work done based the planck spacecraft observations the cmb gave more accurate estimate dark dark matter and ordinary large scale structure the theory large scale structure which governs the formation structures the universe stars quasars galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters also suggests that the density matter the universe only the critical survey the wigglez galaxy survey more than galaxies provided further evidence towards the existence dark although the exact physics behind remains the wigglez survey from australian astronomical observatory scanned the galaxies determine their then exploiting the fact that baryon acoustic oscillations have left voids regularly mpc surrounded the the voids were used standard rulers determine distances galaxies far mpc redshift which allowed astronomers determine more accurately the speeds the galaxies from their redshift and the data confirmed cosmic acceleration half the age the universe billion and constrain its inhomogeneity part this provides confirmation cosmic acceleration independent late time integrated wolfe effect accelerated cosmic expansion causes gravitational potential wells and hills flatten photons pass through producing cold spots and hot spots the cmb aligned with vast supervoids and this called time integrated wolfe effect direct signal dark energy flat was reported high significance and giannantonio observational hubble constant data new approach test evidence dark energy through observational hubble constant data has gained significant attention recent the hubble constant measured function cosmological redshift ohd directly tracks the expansion history the universe taking passively evolving type galaxies cosmic from this this approach provides standard clocks the the core this idea the measurement the differential age evolution function redshift these cosmic thus provides direct estimate the hubble parameter the merit this approach the reliance differential can minimize many common issues and systematic and direct measurement the hubble parameter instead its like supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations brings more information and appealing for these has been widely used examine the accelerated cosmic expansion and study properties dark theories explanation cosmological constant cosmological constant equation state the simplest explanation for dark energy that simply the cost having that volume space has some fundamental this the cosmological sometimes called lambda hence lambda cdm model after the greek letter the symbol used represent this quantity since energy and mass are related einstein theory general relativity predicts that this energy will have gravitational sometimes called vacuum energy because the energy density empty vacuum most theories particle physics predict vacuum fluctuations that would give the vacuum this sort this related the casimir effect which there small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming between plates with tiny the cosmological constant estimated cosmologists the order about reduced planck units citation needed particle physics predicts natural value reduced planck leading large the cosmological constant has negative pressure equal its energy density and causes the expansion the universe accelerate the reason why cosmological constant has negative pressure can seen from classical energy must lost from inside container work the change volume requires work done equal change energy where the but the amount energy container full vacuum actually increases when the volume increases because the energy equal where the energy density the cosmological therefore negative major outstanding problem that most quantum field theories predict huge cosmological constant from the energy the quantum vacuum more than orders magnitude too this would need cancelled but not equally large term the opposite some supersymmetric theories require cosmological constant that exactly citation needed which does not help because supersymmetry must the present scientific consensus amounts extrapolating the empirical evidence where relevant and fine tuning theories until more elegant solution technically this amounts checking theories against macroscopic unfortunately the known margin the constant predicts the fate the universe more than its present many such deeper questions remain spite its the cosmological constant many respects the most economical solution the problem cosmic acceleration one number successfully explains multitude thus the current standard model the cdm includes the cosmological constant essential quintessence quintessence quintessence models dark the observed acceleration the scale factor caused the potential energy dynamical field referred quintessence quintessence differs from the cosmological constant that can vary space and order for not clump and form structure like the field must very light that has large compton wavelength evidence quintessence yet but has not been ruled out generally predicts slightly slower acceleration the expansion the universe than the cosmological some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations equivalence principle and variation the fundamental constants space citation needed scalar fields are predicted the standard model and string theory but analogous problem the cosmological constant problem the problem constructing models cosmic inflation occurs renormalization theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large the cosmic coincidence problem asks why the cosmic acceleration began when cosmic acceleration began earlier the structures such galaxies would never have had time form and least know would never have had chance proponents the anthropic principle view this support for their however many models quintessence have called tracker behavior which solves this these the quintessence field has density which closely tracks but less the radiation density until matter radiation equality which triggers quintessence start behaving dark eventually dominating the this naturally sets the low energy scale the dark citation needed when scientists fit the evolution dark energy with the cosmological they found that the equation state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary from above theorem has been proved that gives this scenario least two degrees freedom required for dark energy this scenario called quintom scenario some special cases quintessence are phantom energy which the energy density quintessence actually increases with and essence short for kinetic which has standard form kinetic energy they can have unusual phantom energy for can cause big rip alternative ideas some alternatives dark energy aim explain the observational data more refined use established focusing for the gravitational effects density consequences electroweak symmetry breaking the early are located average region the observed cosmic expansion rate could mistaken for variation different approach uses cosmological extension the equivalence principle show how space might appear expanding more rapidly the voids surrounding our local while such effects considered cumulatively over billions years could become creating the illusion cosmic and making appear live hubble bubble another class theories attempts come with encompassing theory both dark matter and dark energy single phenomenon that modifies the laws gravity various example this type theory the theory dark fluid another class theories that unifies dark matter and dark energy are suggested covariant theories modified these theories alter the dynamics the time such that the modified dynamic stems what have been assigned the presence dark energy and dark paper the journal physical review christos cosmologist aristotle university thessaloniki argued that likely that the accelerated expansion the universe illusion caused the relative motion the rest the the paper cites data showing that the billion wide region space are inside moving very quickly relative everything around the theory then dark energy would not exist but the dark flow still some theorists think that dark energy and cosmic acceleration are failure general relativity very large larger than superclusters citation needed however most attempts modifying general relativity have turned out either equivalent theories quintessence inconsistent with citation needed other ideas for dark energy have come from string theory brane cosmology and the holographic principle but have not yet proved citation needed compellingly quintessence and the cosmological string article the journal nature described string popular with many particle make even think that the observable universe just one universes grander multiverse says leonard susskind cosmologist stanford university the vacuum energy will have different values different and many most might indeed but must small ours because only such universe that observers such ourselves can paul steinhardt the same article criticizes string explanation dark energy stating anthropics and randomness explain disappointed with what most theorists are willing another set proposals based the possibility double metric tensor for has been argued that time reversed solutions general relativity require such double metric for and that both dark matter and dark energy can understood terms time reversed solutions general implications for the fate the universe this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and march cosmologists estimate that the acceleration began roughly billion years before thought that the expansion was due the attractive influence dark matter and baryons the density dark matter expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark and eventually the dark energy specifically when the volume the universe the density dark matter but the density dark energy nearly unchanged exactly constant the case cosmological the acceleration continues the ultimate result will that galaxies outside the local supercluster will have line sight velocity that continually increases with eventually far exceeding the speed this not violation special relativity because the notion velocity used here different from that velocity local inertial frame reference which still constrained less than the speed light for any massive object see uses the proper distance for discussion the subtleties defining any notion relative velocity because the hubble parameter decreasing with there can actually cases where galaxy that receding from faster than light does manage emit signal which reaches however because the accelerating projected that most galaxies will eventually cross type cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never able reach any time the infinite future because the light never reaches point where its peculiar toward exceeds the expansion velocity away from these two notions velocity are also discussed uses the proper distance assuming the dark energy constant cosmological constant the current distance this cosmological event horizon about billion light meaning that signal from event happening present would eventually able reach the future the event were less than billion light years but the signal would never reach the event were more than billion light years galaxies approach the point crossing this cosmological event the light from them will become more and more redshifted the point where the wavelength becomes too large detect practice and the galaxies appear disappear completely see future expanding universe the the milky way and the virgo supercluster however would remain virtually undisturbed while the rest the universe recedes and disappears from this the local supercluster would ultimately suffer heat death just was thought for the matter dominated universe before measurements cosmic acceleration there are some very speculative ideas about the future the one suggests that phantom energy causes divergent expansion which would imply that the effective force dark energy continues growing until dominates all other forces the under this dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound including galaxies and solar and eventually overcome the electrical and nuclear forces tear apart atoms ending the universe big rip the other dark energy might dissipate with time even become such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead universe that contracts itself big crunch some such the cyclic model suggest this could the also possible the universe may never have end and continue its present state forever see the second law law disorder while these ideas are not supported they are not ruled history discovery and previous speculation this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and november the cosmological constant was first proposed einstein mechanism obtain solution the gravitational field equation that would lead static effectively using dark energy balance not only was the mechanism inelegant example fine tuning but was also later realized that static universe would actually unstable because local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead either the runaway expansion contraction the the equilibrium the universe expands then the expansion releases vacuum which causes yet more likewise universe which contracts slightly will continue these sorts disturbances are due the uneven distribution matter throughout the more observations made edwin hubble showed that the universe appears expanding and not static einstein reportedly referred his failure predict the idea dynamic contrast static his greatest alan guth and alexei starobinsky proposed that negative pressure similar concept dark could drive cosmic inflation the very early inflation postulates that some repulsive qualitatively similar dark resulted enormous and exponential expansion the universe slightly after the big bang such expansion essential feature most current models the big however inflation must have occurred much higher energy density than the dark energy observe today and thought have completely ended when the universe was just fraction second unclear what exists between dark energy and even after inflationary models became the cosmological constant was thought irrelevant the current nearly all inflation models predict that the total density the universe should very close the critical during the most cosmological research focused models with critical density matter usually cold dark matter and ordinary matter these models were found successful forming realistic galaxies and but some problems appeared the late notably the model required value for the hubble constant lower than preferred and the model predicted observations scale galaxy these difficulties became stronger after the discovery anisotropy the cosmic microwave background the cobe spacecraft and several modified cdm models came under active study through the these included the lambda cdm model and mixed hot dark matter the first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations accelerated expansion riess and perlmutter and the cdm model then became the leading soon dark energy was supported independent the boomerang and maxima cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first acoustic peak the showing that the total density close critical then the galaxy redshift survey gave strong evidence that the matter density around the large difference between these two supports smooth component dark energy making the much more precise measurements from wmap have continued support the standard model and give more accurate measurements the key the term dark echoing fritz zwicky dark from the was coined michael turner the lambda cdm model consistent with series increasingly rigorous cosmological including the planck spacecraft and the supernova legacy
