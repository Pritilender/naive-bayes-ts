modeling cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation and evolution and has measurable effects the anisotropies observed the cosmic microwave background all these lines evidence suggest that clusters and the universe whole contain far more matter than that which interacts with electromagnetic important dark matter thought the direct evidence its existence and concrete understanding its nature have remained though the theory dark matter remains the most widely accepted theory explain the anomalies observed galactic some alternative theoretical approaches have been developed which broadly fall into the categories modified gravitational laws and quantum gravitational baryonic and nonbaryonic dark matter play media lat there are three separate lines evidence that the majority dark matter not made baryons ordinary matter including protons and neutrons the theory big bang nucleosynthesis which very accurately predicts the observed abundance the chemical elements predicts that baryonic matter accounts for around percent the the evidence from large scale structure and other observations indicates that the total matter density about the critical large astronomical searches for gravitational microlensing including the eros and ogle have shown that only small fraction the dark matter the milky way can hiding dark compact the excluded range covers objects above half the mass solar excluding nearly all the plausible detailed analysis the small irregularities the cosmic microwave background observed wmap and planck shows that around sixths the total matter form which does not interact significantly with ordinary matter small proportion dark matter may baryonic dark matter astronomical such massive compact halo objects that are composed ordinary matter but which emit little electromagnetic study nucleosynthesis the big bang produces upper bound the amount baryonic matter the which indicates that the vast majority dark matter the universe cannot and thus does not form also cannot interact with ordinary matter via electromagnetic forces dark matter particles not carry any electric charge candidates for nonbaryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such axions supersymmetric particles neutrinos can only form small fraction the dark due limits from large scale structure and redshift unlike baryonic dark nonbaryonic dark matter does not contribute the formation the elements the early universe big bang nucleosynthesis and its presence revealed only via its gravitational the particles which composed are they can undergo annihilation interactions with possibly resulting observable products such gamma rays and neutrinos indirect nonbaryonic dark matter classified terms the mass the that assumed make and the typical velocity dispersion those particles since more massive particles move more there are three prominent hypotheses nonbaryonic dark called cold dark matter warm dark matter and hot dark matter some combination these also the most widely discussed models for nonbaryonic dark matter are based the cold dark matter and the corresponding particle most commonly assumed weakly interacting massive particle hot dark matter may include neutrinos but observations imply that only small fraction dark matter can cold dark matter leads formation structure the universe while hot dark matter would result formation since the late the latter has been ruled out observations redshift galaxies such the hubble deep field observational evidence play media the first person interpret evidence and infer the presence dark matter was dutch astronomer jan oort pioneer radio oort was studying stellar motions the local galactic neighbourhood and found that the mass the galactic plane must more than the material that could but this measurement was later determined essentially the swiss astrophysicist fritz zwicky who studied clusters galaxies while working the california institute technology made similar zwicky applied the virial theorem the coma cluster galaxies and obtained evidence unseen zwicky estimated the total mass based the motions galaxies near its edge and compared that estimate one based the number galaxies and total brightness the found that there was about times more estimated mass than was visually the gravity the visible galaxies the cluster would far too small for such fast something extra was this known the missing mass based these zwicky inferred that there must some visible form matter which would provide enough the mass and gravity hold the cluster much the evidence for dark matter comes from the study the motions many these appear fairly the virial theorem the total kinetic energy should half the total gravitational binding energy the observationally however the total kinetic energy found much assuming the gravitational mass due only the visible matter the stars far from the center galaxies have much higher velocities than predicted the virial galactic rotation curves which illustrate the velocity rotation versus the distance from the galactic cannot explained only the visible assuming that the visible material makes only small part the cluster the most straightforward way accounting for galaxies show signs being composed largely roughly spherically centrally concentrated halo dark matter with the visible matter concentrated disc the low surface brightness dwarf galaxies are important sources information for studying dark they have uncommonly low ratio visible matter dark and have few bright stars the center which would otherwise impair observations the rotation curve outlying gravitational lensing observations galaxy clusters allow direct estimates the gravitational mass based its effect light from background since large collections matter dark will gravitationally deflect clusters such abell lensing observations confirm the presence considerably more mass than indicated the light the bullet cluster lensing observations show that much the lensing mass separated from the emitting baryonic july lensing observations were used identify filament dark matter between two clusters cosmological simulations have galaxy rotation curves galaxy rotation curve after initial the first indication that the mass light ratio was anything other than unity came from measurements made horace babcock babcock reported his phd thesis measurements the rotation curve for the andromeda nebula which suggested that the luminosity ratio increases however attributed either absorption light within the galaxy modified dynamics the outer portions the spiral and not any form missing the late and early vera rubin young astronomer the department terrestrial magnetism the carnegie institution washington worked with new sensitive spectrograph that could measure the velocity curve spiral galaxies greater degree accuracy than had ever before been together with fellow member kent ford rubin announced meeting the american astronomical society the discovery that most stars spiral galaxies orbit roughly the same which implied that the mass densities the galaxies were uniform well beyond the regions containing most the stars the galactic bulge result independently found influential paper presented results rubin observations and calculations showed that most galaxies must contain about six times much mass can accounted for the visible eventually other astronomers began corroborate her work and soon became established that most galaxies were dominated dark low surface brightness galaxies lsbs are probably everywhere dark with the observed stellar populations making only small contribution rotation such property extremely important because allows one avoid the difficulties associated with the deprojection and disentanglement the dark and visible contributions the rotation spiral galaxies rotation curves both low and high surface luminosity galaxies appear suggest universal density which can expressed the sum exponential thin stellar and spherical dark matter halo with flat core radius and density kpc denotes solar elliptical galaxies some elliptical galaxies show evidence for dark matter via strong gravitational ray evidence reveals the presence extended atmospheres hot gas that fill the dark haloes isolated ellipticals and whose hydrostatic support provides evidence for dark other ellipticals have low velocities their outskirts tracked for example planetary nebulae and were interpreted not having dark matter however simulations galaxy mergers indicate that stars were torn tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close passage and put outgoing explaining the low velocities even with more research needed clarify this simulated dark matter haloes have significantly steeper density profiles having central than are inferred from which problem for cosmological models with dark matter the smallest scale galaxies this may only problem star forming regions which might alter the dark matter distribution via outflows gas have been too small resolve and model simultaneously with larger dark matter recent simulation dwarf galaxy resolving these forming regions reported that strong outflows from supernovae remove momentum which inhibits the formation galactic bulge and decreases the dark matter density less than half what would have been the central kiloparsec these simulation bulgeless and with shallow central dark matter correspond closely observations actual dwarf there are such discrepancies the larger scales clusters galaxies and the outer regions haloes exceptions this general picture dark matter haloes for galaxies appear galaxies with light ratios close that citation needed subsequent numerous observations have been made that indicate the presence dark matter various parts the such observations the cosmic microwave background supernovas used distance gravitational lensing various and many types sky together with findings for spiral galaxies and work galaxy the observational evidence for dark matter has been collecting over the decades the point that the most astrophysicists accepted its unifying dark matter one the dominant features considered the analysis structures the order galactic scale and velocity dispersions galaxies the velocity dispersion the range velocities about the mean velocity for group such cluster stars about rubin pioneering work has stood the test measurements velocity curves spiral galaxies were soon followed with velocity dispersions elliptical galaxies while sometimes appearing with lower light measurements ellipticals still indicate relatively high dark matter likewise measurements the diffuse interstellar gas found the edge galaxies indicate not only dark matter distributions that extend beyond the visible limit the but also that the galaxies are virialized gravitationally bound with velocities corresponding predicted orbital velocities general relativity ten times their visible citation needed this has the effect pushing the dark matter fraction the total amount gravitating matter from measured rubin the now accepted value nearly there are places where dark matter seems small component totally globular clusters show little evidence that they contain dark though their orbital interactions with galaxies show evidence for galactic dark citation needed for some measurements the velocity profile stars seemed indicate concentration dark matter the disk the milky way galaxy now however that the high concentration baryonic matter the disk the galaxy especially the interstellar can account for this galaxy mass profiles are thought look very different from the light the typical model for dark matter galaxies spherical distribution virialized halos such would have the case avoid scale dynamical recent research reported january from the university massachusetts amherst would explain the previously mysterious warp the disk the milky way the interaction the large and small magellanic clouds and the predicted fold increase mass the milky way taking into account dark astronomers from cardiff university claimed have discovered galaxy made almost entirely dark million light years away the virgo cluster which was named virgohi unusually virgohi does not appear contain any visible was seen with radio frequency observations based rotation the scientists estimate that this object contains approximately times more dark matter than hydrogen and has total mass about that the milky way galaxy live for the milky way estimated have roughly times much dark matter ordinary models the big bang and structure formation have suggested that such dark galaxies should very common the universe citation needed but none had previously been the existence this dark galaxy provides strong evidence for the theory galaxy formation and poses problems for alternative explanations dark there are some galaxies whose velocity profile indicates absence dark such ngc galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing hubble space telescope galaxy clusters are especially important for dark matter studies since their masses can estimated three independent from the scatter radial velocities the galaxies within them early with much larger modern from rays emitted very hot gas within the the temperature and density the gas can estimated from the energy and flux the hence the gas assuming pressure and gravity this enables the mass profile the cluster many the experiments the chandra ray observatory use this technique independently determine the mass these observations generally indicate ratio baryonic total mass approximately percent reasonable agreement with the planck spacecraft cosmic average percent from their gravitational lensing effects background usually more distant this observed strong multiple near the cluster and weak lensing shape the outer several large hubble projects have used this method measure cluster generally these three methods are reasonable that clusters contain much more matter than the visible galaxies and gravitational lens formed when the light from more distant source such quasar bent around massive object such cluster galaxies between the source object and the the process known gravitational the galaxy cluster abell composed thousands galaxies enveloped cloud hot and amount dark matter equivalent more than suns the center this cluster elliptically shaped galaxy that thought have been formed from the mergers many smaller the measured orbital velocities galaxies within galactic clusters have been found consistent with dark matter another important tool for future dark matter observations gravitational lensing relies the effects general relativity predict masses without relying and completely independent means measuring the dark strong the observed distortion background galaxies into arcs when the light passes through gravitational has been observed around few distant clusters including abell pictured measuring the distortion the mass the cluster causing the phenomena can the dozens cases where this has been the light ratios obtained correspond the dynamical dark matter measurements weak gravitational lensing looks minute distortions galaxies observed vast galaxy surveys due foreground objects through statistical examining the apparent shear deformation the adjacent background astrophysicists can characterize the mean distribution dark matter statistical means and have found light ratios that correspond dark matter densities predicted other scale structure the correspondence the two gravitational lens techniques other dark matter measurements has convinced almost all astrophysicists that dark matter actually exists major component the bullet cluster hst chandra the most direct observational evidence date for dark matter system known the bullet cluster most regions the dark matter and visible material are found expected because their mutual gravitational the bullet collision between two galaxy clusters appears have caused separation dark matter and baryonic ray observations show that much the baryonic matter the form kelvin gas plasma the system concentrated the center the electromagnetic interactions between passing gas particles caused them slow down and settle near the point however weak gravitational lensing observations the same system show that much the mass resides outside the central region baryonic because dark matter does not interact electromagnetic would not have been slowed the same way the ray visible the dark matter components the two clusters passed through each other without slowing down this accounts for the unlike the galactic rotation this evidence for dark matter independent the details newtonian gravity claimed direct evidence the existence dark another galaxy known the train wreck cluster abell appears have unusually massive and dark core containing few the which presents problems for standard dark matter this may explained the dark core actually being low density dark matter filament containing few along the line projected onto the cluster the observed behavior dark matter clusters constrains whether and how much dark matter scatters off other dark matter quantified its interaction cross section more the question whether the dark matter has pressure and thus can described perfect fluid the distribution mass and thus dark galaxy clusters has been used argue both for and against the existence significant interaction dark specifically the distribution dark matter merging clusters such the bullet cluster shows that dark matter scatters off other dark matter particles only very weakly cosmic microwave background cosmic microwave background radiation wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe angular fluctuations the cosmic microwave background spectrum provide evidence for dark since the discovery and confirmation the cmb many measurements the cmb have supported and constrained this the nasa cosmic background explorer cobe found that the cmb spectrum blackbody spectrum with temperature cobe detected fluctuations the cmb level about one part during the following cmb anisotropies were further investigated large number based and balloon the primary goal these experiments was measure the angular scale the first acoustic peak the power spectrum the for which cobe did not have sufficient several most notably boomerang found the universe almost spatially flat measuring the typical angular size the size the the during the the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and the boomerang experiment reported that the highest power fluctuations occur scales approximately one these measurements were able rule out cosmic strings the leading theory cosmic structure formation and suggested cosmic inflation was the right number based interferometers provided measurements the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three including the very small array the degree angular scale interferometer and the cosmic background imager dasi made the first detection the polarization the and the cbi provided the first mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that out phase with the mode cobe the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe has provided the most detailed measurements anisotropies the cmb with planck spacecraft returning more detailed results wmap measurements played the key role establishing the current standard model namely the lambda cdm model flat universe dominated dark supplemented dark matter and atoms with density fluctuations seeded gaussian adiabatic nearly scale invariant process the basic properties this universe are determined five the density the density the age the universe the hubble constant today the amplitude the initial and their scale successful big bang cosmology theory must fit with all available astronomical including the the cmb explained relic radiation from shortly after the big the anisotropies the cmb are explained acoustic oscillations the baryon plasma prior the emission the cmb after the photons decouple from the baryons years after the big whose restoring force ordinary matter interacts strongly with radiation dark matter does both affect the oscillations their the two forms matter will have different the typical angular scales the oscillations the measured the power spectrum the cmb thus reveal the different effects baryonic matter and dark the cmb power spectrum shows large first peak and smaller successive with three peaks resolved the first peak tells mostly about the density baryonic matter and the third peak mostly about the density dark measuring the density matter and the density atoms the sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations baryon acoustic oscillations the acoustic oscillations the early universe see the previous leave their imprint the visible matter baryon acoustic oscillation clustering way that can measured with sky surveys such the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy redshift survey these measurements are consistent with those the cmb derived from the wmap spacecraft and further constrain the lambda cdm model and dark note that the cmb data and the bao data measure the acoustic oscillations very different distance scales type supernovae distance measurements type supernova type supernovae can used standard candles measure extragalactic and extensive data sets these supernovae can used constrain cosmological they constrain the dark energy density for lambda cdm universe and the parameter for quintessence model once the values obtained are roughly consistent with those derived from the wmap observations and further constrain the lambda cdm model and dark lyman alpha forest lyman alpha forest astronomical spectroscopy the alpha forest the sum absorption lines arising from the lyman alpha transition the neutral hydrogen the spectra distant galaxies and quasars observations the alpha forest can also used constrain cosmological these constraints are again agreement with those obtained from wmap structure formation structure formation dark matter crucial the big bang model cosmology component which corresponds directly measurements the parameters associated with friedmann cosmology solutions general measurements the cosmic microwave background anisotropies correspond cosmology where much the matter interacts with photons more weakly than the known forces that couple light interactions baryonic likewise significant amount baryonic cold matter necessary explain the large scale structure the universe observations suggest that structure formation the universe proceeds with the smallest structures collapsing first and followed galaxies and then clusters the structures collapse the evolving they begin light the baryonic matter heats through gravitational contraction and the object approaches hydrostatic pressure balance ordinary baryonic matter had too high and too much pressure left over from the big bang collapse and form smaller such via the jeans instability dark matter acts compactor this model not only corresponds with statistical surveying the visible structure the universe but also corresponds precisely the dark matter predictions the cosmic microwave this bottom model structure formation requires something like cold dark matter large computer simulations billions dark matter particles have been used confirm that the cold dark matter model structure formation consistent with the structures observed the universe through galaxy such the sloan digital sky survey and galaxy redshift survey well observations the lyman alpha forest these studies have been crucial constructing the lambda cdm model which measures the cosmological including the fraction the universe made baryons and dark there however several points tension between observation and simulations structure formation driven dark there evidence that there are times fewer small galaxies than permitted what the dark matter theory galaxy formation this known the dwarf galaxy problem the simulations predict dark matter distributions with very dense cusp near the centers but the observed halos are smoother than predicted history the search for its composition list unsolved problems physics what dark how related supersymmetry although dark matter had historically been inferred many astronomical its composition long remained early theories dark matter concentrated hidden heavy normal objects such black neutron faint old white and brown the possible candidates for dark collectively known massive compact halo objects machos astronomical surveys for gravitational microlensing including the eros and ogle along with hubble telescope searches for faint have not found enough these hidden some detect baryonic matter such machos and some forms were additionally speculated make contribution the overall dark matter but evidence indicated such would constitute only small furthermore data from number lines other including galaxy rotation curves gravitational structure and the fraction baryons clusters and the cluster abundance combined with independent evidence for the baryon indicated that the mass the universe does not interact with the electromagnetic force this nonbaryonic dark evident through its gravitational consequently the most commonly held view was that dark matter primarily made one more elementary particles other than the usual electrons protons neutrons and known neutrinos the most commonly proposed particles then became wimps weakly interacting massive including neutralinos axions sterile though many other possible candidates have been the dark matter component has much more mass than the visible component the universe only about the energy the universe ordinary about thought composed dark the remaining thought consist dark energy even stranger distributed almost uniformly space and with energy density evolving slowly evolving with determining the nature this dark matter one the most important problems modern cosmology and particle physics has been noted that the names dark and dark serve mainly expressions human much like the marking early maps with terra incognita dark matter candidates can approximately divided into three called cold warm and hot dark these categories not correspond actual but instead refer how fast the particles were thus how far they moved due random motions the early before they slowed down due the expansion the this important distance called the free streaming primordial density fluctuations smaller than this streaming length get washed out particles move from overdense underdense while fluctuations larger than the streaming length are therefore this streaming length sets minimum scale for structure cold dark objects with streaming length much smaller than protogalaxy warm dark particles with streaming length similar hot dark particles with streaming length much larger than though fourth category had been considered early called mixed dark matter was quickly eliminated from the since the discovery dark davis wrote candidate particles can grouped into three categories the basis their effect the fluctuation spectrum bond the dark matter composed abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before then may termed hot the best candidate for hot dark matter neutrino second possibility for the dark matter particles interact more weakly than less and have mass order such particles are termed warm dark because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos there are present few candidate particles which fit this gravitinos and photinos have been suggested pagels and primack bond szalay and turner any particles which became nonrelativistic very and were able diffuse negligible are termed cold dark matter there are many candidates for cdm including supersymmetric the full calculations are quite but approximate dividing line that warm dark matter particles became relativistic when the universe was approximately year old and millionth its present standard hot big bang theory implies the universe was then the radiation dominated era photons and with photon temperature million standard physical cosmology gives the particle horizon size the dominated thus light and region this size would expand million light years today there were structure the actual streaming length roughly times larger than the above since the streaming length continues grow slowly particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become therefore this example the streaming length would correspond million years mpc which around the size containing average the mass large the above temperature million which gives typical photon energy electron this sets typical mass scale for warm dark particles much more massive than such tev mass wimps would become relativistic much earlier than year after the big thus have streaming length which much smaller than galaxy and effectively negligible thus cold dark conversely much lighter particles neutrinos mass few have streaming length much larger than galaxy thus hot dark cold dark matter cold dark matter cold dark matter the simplest explanation for most cosmological cold dark matter dark matter composed constituents with streaming length much smaller than the ancestor scale this currently the area greatest interest for dark matter hot dark matter does not seem viable for galaxy and galaxy cluster and most particle candidates become relativistic very early hence are classified the composition the constituents cold dark matter currently possibilities range from large objects like machos such black holes rambos new particles like wimps and axions possibilities involving normal baryonic matter include brown dwarfs other stellar remnants such white dwarfs perhaps dense chunks heavy studies big bang nucleosynthesis and gravitational lensing have convinced most scientists that machos any type cannot more than small fraction the total dark black holes nearly any mass are ruled out primary dark matter constituent variety searches and according peter the only really plausible dark matter candidates are new the dama nai experiment and its successor dama libra have claimed directly detect dark matter particles passing through the but many scientists remain negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the dama many supersymmetric models naturally give rise stable dark matter candidates the form the lightest supersymmetric particle separately heavy sterile neutrinos exist supersymmetric extensions the standard model that explain the small neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism warm dark matter warm dark matter warm dark matter refers particles with streaming length comparable the size region which subsequently evolved into dwarf this leads predictions which are very similar cold dark matter large including the galaxy clustering and large galaxy rotation but with less scale density this reduces the predicted abundance dwarf galaxies and may lead lower density dark matter the central parts large some researchers consider this may better fit challenge for this model that there are very motivated particle physics candidates with the required mass there have been particles discovered far that can categorized warm dark there postulated candidate for the warm dark matter which the sterile neutrino slower form neutrino which does not even interact through the weak force unlike regular interestingly some modified gravity such scalar vector gravity also require that warm dark matter exist make their equations work hot dark matter hot dark matter hot dark matter consists particles that have streaming length much larger than galaxy example hot dark matter already the neutrino neutrinos were discovered quite separately from the search for dark and long before seriously they were first postulated and first detected neutrinos have very small mass least times less massive than other than neutrinos only interact with normal matter via the weak force making them very difficult detect the weak force only works over small thus neutrino will only trigger weak force event hits nucleus directly this would classify them weakly interacting light opposed cold dark theoretical the wimps there are three different known flavors neutrinos the electron muon and tau and their masses are slightly the resolution the solar neutrino problem demonstrated that these three types neutrinos actually change and oscillate from one flavor the others and back they are hard determine exact upper bound the collective average mass the three neutrinos let alone mass for any the three for the average neutrino mass were chosen over which still less than the mass just the sheer number them the the universe would collapse due their other observations have served estimate bound for the neutrino mass using cosmic microwave background data and other the current conclusion that their average mass probably does not exceed thus the normal forms neutrinos cannot responsible for the measured dark matter component from hot dark matter was popular for time the early but suffers from severe since all size density fluctuations get washed out the first objects which can form are huge size which then were theorised somehow fragment into deep field observations clearly show that galaxies formed early with clusters and superclusters forming later galaxies clump any model dominated hot dark matter seriously conflict with mixed dark matter mixed dark matter mixed dark matter now obsolete with specifically chosen mass ratio cold dark matter and hot dark matter content though presumable that hot dark matter coexists with cold dark matter any there was very specific reason for choosing this particular ratio hot cold dark matter this during the early became steadily clear that universe with critical density cold dark matter did not fit the cobe and scale galaxy clustering either the mixed dark matter were able reconcile with the discovery the accelerating universe from and more accurate measurements cmb anisotropy and galaxy the mixed dark matter model was essentially ruled out while the concordance lambdacdm model remained good detection the dark matter within our galaxy made weakly interacting massive particles then thousands wimps must pass through every square centimeter the earth each there are many experiments currently aiming test this hypothesis searching for although wimps are the historically more popular dark matter candidate for there are experiments searching for other particle the axion dark matter experiment admx currently searching for the dark matter axion motivated and constrained dark matter also possible that dark matter consists very heavy hidden sector particles which only interact with ordinary matter via these experiments can divided into two direct detection which search for the scattering dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within and indirect which look for the products wimp alternative approach the detection wimps nature produce them the experiments with the large hadron collider may able detect wimps produced collisions the lhc proton beams because wimp has negligible interactions with may detected indirectly large amounts missing energy and momentum which escape the lhc provided all the other collision products are these experiments could show that wimps can but would still require direct detection experiment show that they exist sufficient numbers the galaxy account for dark direct detection experiments direct detection experiments typically operate deep underground laboratories reduce the background from cosmic these the soudan mine the snolab underground laboratory sudbury ontario the gran sasso national laboratory the canfranc underground laboratory the boulby underground laboratory and the deep underground science and engineering laboratory south dakota the majority present experiments use one two detector cryogenic operating temperatures below detect the heat produced when particle hits atom crystal absorber such germanium noble liquid detectors detect the flash scintillation light produced particle collision liquid xenon argon cryogenic detector experiments cdms cresst edelweiss eureca noble liquid experiments include xenon deap ardm warp darkside and the large underground xenon detector both these detector techniques are capable distinguishing background particles which scatter off from dark matter particles which scatter off other experiments include simple and picasso the dama nai dama libra experiments have detected annual modulation the event which they claim due dark matter the earth orbits the the velocity the detector relative the dark matter halo will vary small amount depending the time this claim far unconfirmed and difficult reconcile with the negative results other experiments assuming that the wimp scenario directional detection dark matter search strategy based the motion the solar system around the galactic using low pressure tpc possible access information recoiling tracks reconstruction and constrain the nucleus wimps coming from the direction which the sun travelling roughly the direction the cygnus may then separated from background which should directional dark matter experiments include dmtpc drift newage and december cdms researchers reported two possible wimp candidate they estimate that the probability that these events are due known background neutrons misidentified beta gamma and conclude this analysis cannot interpreted significant evidence for wimp but cannot reject either event more september researchers using the cresst detectors presented evidence collisions occurring detector crystals from atomic calculating there less than chance that all were caused known sources interference quite possible then that many these collisions were caused and other unknown indirect detection experiments indirect detection experiments search for the products wimp annihilation wimps are majorana particles wimps are their own then two wimps could annihilate produce gamma rays standard model antiparticle additionally the wimp wimps could decay into standard model these processes could detected indirectly through excess gamma antiprotons positrons emanating from regions high dark matter the detection such signal not conclusive evidence for dark the production gamma rays from other sources not fully the egret gamma ray telescope observed more gamma rays than expected from the milky but scientists concluded that this was most likely due estimation the the fermi ray space telescope launched june searching for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation and april analysis previously available data from its large area telescope instrument produced strong statistical evidence gev line the gamma radiation coming from the center the milky the wimp annihilation was the most probable explanation for that higher ground based ray telescopes have set limits the annihilation dark matter dwarf spheroidal galaxies and clusters the pamela experiment launched has detected larger number positrons than these extra positrons could produced dark matter but may also come from pulsars excess protons has been the alpha magnetic spectrometer the international space station designed directly measure the fraction cosmic rays which are positrons the first published april indicate excess energy cosmic rays which could potentially due annihilation dark few the wimps passing through the sun earth may scatter off atoms and lose this way large population wimps may accumulate the center these increasing the chance that two will collide and this could produce distinctive signal the form energy neutrinos originating from the center the sun generally considered that the detection such signal would the strongest indirect proof wimp dark high energy neutrino telescopes such amanda icecube and antares are searching for this wimp annihilation from the milky way galaxy whole may also detected the form various annihilation the galactic center particularly good place look because the density dark matter may very high two independent and separate one led the leiden astrophysicist alexey boyarsky and another from harvard reported unidentified ray emission line around kev the spectra clusters possible this could indirect signal from dark matter and that could new sterile neutrino which has alternative theories numerous alternatives have been proposed explain these observations without the need for large amount undetected most these modify the laws gravity established newton and einstein some modified gravity laws the earliest modified gravity model emerge was mordehai milgrom modified newtonian dynamics which adjusts newton laws create stronger gravitational field when gravitational acceleration levels become tiny such near the rim had some success explaining galactic scale such rotational velocity curves elliptical and dwarf elliptical but did not successfully explain galaxy cluster gravitational however mond was not relativistic since was just straight adjustment the older newtonian account not the newer account general relativity soon after attempts were made bring mond into conformity with general this ongoing and many competing hypotheses have emerged based around the original mond including teves mog stv gravity and phenomenological covariant among john moffat proposed modified gravity hypothesis based the nonsymmetric gravitational theory that claims account for the behavior colliding this model requires the presence relativistic other candidates for dark another proposal uses gravitational backreaction emerging theoretical field that seeks explain gravity between objects and then simply object affects object and the object then affects object and creating sort feedback loop that strengthens recently another group has proposed modification large scale gravity hypothesis named dark fluid this the attractive gravitational effects attributed dark matter are instead effect dark dark fluid combines dark matter and dark energy single energy field that produces different effects different this treatment simplified approach previous fluid like
