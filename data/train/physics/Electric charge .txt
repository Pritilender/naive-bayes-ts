gauss heaviside henry hertz lorentz maxwell tesla volta weber rsted electric charge the physical property matter that causes experience force when placed electromagnetic there are two types electric charges positive and negative positively charged substances are repelled from other positively charged but attracted negatively charged negatively charged substances are repelled from negative and attracted object will negatively charged has excess electrons and will otherwise positively charged the derived unit electric charge the coulomb although electrical engineering also common use the ampere hour and chemistry common use the elementary charge the symbol often used denote the early knowledge how charged substances interact now called classical electrodynamics and still very accurate quantum effects not need the electric charge fundamental conserved property some subatomic particles which determines their electromagnetic interaction electrically charged matter influenced and electromagnetic fields the interaction between moving charge and electromagnetic field the source the electromagnetic force which one the four fundamental forces see magnetic field twentieth century experiments demonstrated that electric charge quantized that comes integer multiples individual small units called the elementary charge approximately equal coulombs except for particles called quarks which have charges that are integer multiples the proton has charge and the electron has charge the study charged and how their interactions are mediated photons called quantum electrodynamics contents overview units history static electricity and electric current electrification friction properties conservation electric charge see also references external links overview equipotentials electron atom charge the fundamental property forms matter that exhibit electrostatic attraction repulsion the presence other electric charge characteristic property many subatomic particles the charges standing particles are integer multiples the elementary charge say that electric charge quantized michael faraday his electrolysis experiments was the first note the discrete nature electric robert millikan oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact and measured the elementary the charge electron while that proton charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one and particles whose charges have different signs coulomb law quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles asserting that the force proportional the product their and inversely proportional the square the distance between the charge antiparticle equals that the corresponding but with opposite quarks have fractional charges either but standing quarks have never been observed the theoretical reason for this fact asymptotic freedom the electric charge macroscopic object the sum the electric charges the particles that make this charge often because matter made atoms and atoms typically have equal numbers protons and electrons which case their charges cancel yielding net charge thus making the atom ion atom group that has lost one more giving net positive charge that has gained one more giving net negative charge monatomic ions are formed from single while polyatomic ions are formed from two more atoms that have been bonded each case yielding ion with positive negative net during the formation macroscopic usually the constituent atoms and ions will combine such manner that they form structures composed neutral ionic compounds electrically bound neutral thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net there are times when macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the rigidly bound giving overall net positive negative charge the also macroscopic objects made conductive can more less easily depending the take give off and then maintain net negative positive charge when the net electric charge object zero and the phenomenon known static electricity this can easily produced rubbing two dissimilar materials such rubbing amber with fur glass with silk this way conductive materials can charged significant either positively charge taken from one material moved the other leaving opposite charge the same magnitude the law conservation charge always giving the object from which negative charge has been taken positive charge the same and even when net charge charge can distributed uniformly the object due external electromagnetic field bound polar such cases the object said polarized the charge due polarization known bound charge while charge object produced electrons gained lost from outside the object called free charge the motion electrons conductive metals specific direction known electric current units the unit quantity electric charge the coulomb which equivalent about the charge hence the charge electron approximately the coulomb defined the quantity charge that has passed through the cross section electrical conductor carrying one ampere within one second the symbol often used denote quantity electricity the quantity electric charge can directly measured with electrometer indirectly measured with ballistic galvanometer after finding the quantized character george stoney proposed the unit for this fundamental unit electrical this was before the discovery the particle thomson the unit today treated referred elementary fundamental unit simply measure charge should multiple the elementary charge even large scales charge seems behave real quantity some contexts meaningful speak fractions for example the charging capacitor the fractional quantum hall effect history torsion balance reported the ancient greek philosopher thales miletus around charge electricity could accumulated rubbing fur various such amber the greeks noted that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such hair they also noted that they rubbed the amber for long they could even get electric spark this property derives from the triboelectric effect the english scientist william gilbert returned the subject magnete and coined the new latin word electricus from elektron the greek word for amber which soon gave rise the english words electric and was followed otto von guericke who invented what was probably the first electrostatic generator other european pioneers were robert boyle who stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across vacuum stephen gray who classified materials conductors and insulators and fay who proposed that electricity comes two varieties that cancel each and expressed this terms fluid when glass was rubbed with silk fay said that the glass was charged with vitreous electricity and when amber was rubbed with the amber was said charged with resinous electricity michael faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity current electricity and bioelectricity was and all were consequence the behavior single kind electricity appearing opposite polarities arbitrary which polarity called positive and which called positive charge can defined the charge left glass rod after being rubbed with one the foremost experts electricity the century was benjamin franklin who argued favour fluid theory electricity franklin imagined electricity being type invisible fluid present all for believed that was the glass leyden jar that held the accumulated posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid change and that flow this fluid constitutes electric also posited that when matter contained too little the fluid was negatively charged and when had excess was positively charged for reason that was not identified the term positive with vitreous electricity and negative with resinous william watson arrived the same explanation about the same static electricity and electric current static electricity and electric current are two separate both involving electric and may occur simultaneously the same static electricity reference the electric charge object and the related electrostatic discharge when two objects are brought together that are not electrostatic discharge creates change the charge each the two electric current the flow electric charge through which produces net loss gain electric electrification friction triboelectric effect let piece glass and piece neither which exhibiting any electrical rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces they will still exhibit electrical let them they will now attract each second piece glass rubbed with second piece and the piece then separated and suspended the neighbourhood the former pieces glass and may that the two pieces glass repel each that each piece glass attracts each piece that the two pieces resin repel each these phenomena attraction and repulsion are called electrical and the bodies that exhibit them are said charged with bodies may electrified many other well the electrical properties the two pieces glass are similar each other but opposite those the two pieces the glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin body electrified any manner whatsoever behaves the glass that repels the glass and attracts the the body said electrified and attracts the glass and repels the resin said electrified all electrified bodies are found either vitreously resinously the established convention the scientific community define the vitreous electrification and the resinous electrification the exactly opposite properties the two kinds electrification justify our indicating them opposite but the application the positive sign one rather than the other kind must considered matter arbitrary just matter convention mathematical diagram reckon positive distances towards the right either attraction can observed between electrified body and body not actually all bodies are but may appear not the relative similar charge neighboring objects the object further electrified creates equivalent opposite charge default neighboring until those charges can the effects attraction can observed voltage while lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less the attraction and repulsion forces are codified coulomb law attraction falls off the square the which has corollary for acceleration gravitational suggesting that gravitation may merely electrostatic phenomenon between relatively weak charges terms see also the casimir effect now known that the watson model was fundamentally there only one kind electrical and only one variable required keep track the amount the other just knowing the charge not complete description the matter composed several kinds electrically charged and these particles have many not just the most common charge carriers are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron the movement any these charged particles constitutes electric many suffices speak the conventional current without regard whether carried positive charges moving the direction the conventional current negative charges moving the opposite this macroscopic viewpoint approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and the opposite one looks the microscopic one sees there are many ways carrying electric current including flow flow electron holes that act like positive and both negative and positive particles ions other charged flowing opposite directions electrolytic solution plasma beware the common and important case metallic the direction the conventional current opposite the drift velocity the actual charge the

that any particle that has charge matter how fast always has charge this property has been experimentally verified showing that the charge one helium nucleus two protons and two neutrons bound
