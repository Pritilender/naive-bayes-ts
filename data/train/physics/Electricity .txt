people were aware shocks from electric fish ancient egyptian texts dating from referred these fish the thunderer the nile and described them the protectors all other electric fish were again reported millennia later ancient greek roman and arabic naturalists and physicians several ancient such pliny the elder and scribonius largus attested the numbing effect electric shocks delivered catfish and torpedo rays and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting patients suffering from ailments such gout headache were directed touch electric fish the hope that the powerful jolt might cure possibly the earliest and nearest approach the discovery the identity lightning and electricity from any other attributed the who before the century had the arabic word for lightning raad applied the electric ray ancient cultures around the mediterranean knew that certain such rods amber could rubbed with fur attract light objects like thales miletus made series observations static electricity around from which believed that friction rendered amber magnetic contrast minerals such magnetite which needed thales was incorrect believing the attraction was due magnetic but later science would prove link between magnetism and according controversial the parthians may have had knowledge electroplating based the discovery the baghdad battery which resembles galvanic cell though uncertain whether the artifact was electrical benjamin franklin joseph priestley history and present status electricity electricity would remain little more than intellectual curiosity for millennia until when the english scientist william gilbert made careful study electricity and distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced rubbing coined the new latin word electricus like from elektron the greek word for amber refer the property attracting small objects after being this association gave rise the english words electric and electricity which made their first appearance print thomas browne pseudodoxia epidemica further work was conducted otto von guericke robert boyle stephen gray and fay the benjamin franklin conducted extensive research selling his possessions fund his june reputed have attached metal key the bottom dampened kite string and flown the kite threatened succession sparks jumping from the key the back his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior the leyden jar device for storing large amounts electrical charge terms electricity consisting both positive and negative michael faraday luigi galvani published his discovery bioelectricity demonstrating that electricity was the medium which nerve cells passed signals the alessandro volta voltaic pile made from alternating layers zinc and provided scientists with more reliable source electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously the recognition electromagnetism the unity electric and magnetic due hans christian rsted and andr marie michael faraday invented the electric motor and georg ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit electricity and magnetism and were definitively linked james clerk maxwell particular his physical lines force and while the early century had seen rapid progress electrical the late century would see the greatest progress electrical engineering through such people alexander graham bell ott thy thomas edison galileo ferraris oliver heaviside nyos jedlik lord kelvin sir charles parsons ernst werner von siemens joseph swan nikola tesla and george westinghouse electricity turned from scientific curiosity into essential tool for modern becoming driving force the second industrial revolution heinrich hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more albert einstein published paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect being the result light energy being carried discrete quantized energising this discovery led the quantum revolution einstein was awarded the nobel prize for his discovery the law the photoelectric the photoelectric effect also employed photocells such can found solar panels and this frequently used make electricity the first solid state device was the cat whisker detector first used radio like wire placed lightly contact with solid crystal such germanium crystal order detect radio signal the contact junction state the current confined solid elements and compounds engineered specifically switch and amplify current flow can understood two negatively charged electrons and positively charged electron deficiencies called holes these charges and holes are understood terms quantum the building material most often crystalline semiconductor the state device came into its own with the invention the transistor common state devices include transistors microprocessor chips and ram specialized type ram called flash ram used flash drives and more solid state drives replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard drives solid state devices became prevalent the and the during the transition from vacuum tube technology semiconductor diodes transistors integrated circuit and the light emitting diode concepts electric charge main electric charge see electron proton and ion gold leaf electroscope the presence charge gives rise electrostatic charges exert force each effect that was though not lightweight ball suspended from string can charged touching with glass rod that has itself been charged rubbing with similar ball charged the same glass found repel the the charge acts force the two balls two balls that are charged with rubbed amber rod also repel each however one ball charged the glass and the other amber the two balls are found attract each these phenomena were investigated the late eighteenth century charles augustin coulomb who deduced that charge manifests itself two opposing this discovery led the known like charged objects repel and charged objects attract the force acts the charged particles hence charge has tendency spread itself evenly possible over conducting the magnitude the electromagnetic whether attractive given coulomb law which relates the force the product the charges and has inverse square relation the distance between the electromagnetic force very second only strength the strong interaction but unlike that force operates over all comparison with the much weaker gravitational force the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart times that the gravitational attraction pulling them study has shown that the origin charge from certain types subatomic particles which have the property electric electric charge gives rise and interacts with the electromagnetic force one the four fundamental forces the most familiar carriers electrical charge are the electron and proton experiment has shown charge conserved quantity that the net charge within isolated system will always remain constant regardless any changes taking place within that within the charge may transferred between either direct passing along conducting such the informal term static electricity refers the net presence charge usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed transferring charge from one the the charge electrons and protons opposite hence amount charge may expressed being either negative the charge carried electrons deemed and that protons custom that originated with the work benjamin franklin the amount charge usually given the symbol and expressed coulombs each electron carries the same charge approximately coulomb the proton has charge that equal and and thus coulomb charge possessed not just matter but also antimatter each antiparticle bearing equal and opposite charge its corresponding charge can measured number early instrument being the gold leaf electroscope which although still use for classroom has been superseded the electronic electrometer electric current electric current the movement electric charge known electric current the intensity which usually measured amperes current can consist any moving charged most commonly these are but any charge motion constitutes historical positive current defined having the same direction flow any positive charge flow from the most positive part circuit the most negative current defined this manner called conventional current the motion negatively charged electrons around electric circuit one the most familiar forms thus deemed positive the opposite direction that the however depending the electric current can consist flow charged particles either even both directions the negative convention widely used simplify this electric arc the process which electric current passes through material termed electrical conduction and its nature varies with that the charged particles and the material through which they are examples electric currents include metallic where electrons flow through conductor such and electrolysis where ions charged atoms flow through through plasmas such electrical while the particles themselves can move quite sometimes with average drift velocity only fractions millimetre per the electric field that drives them itself propagates close the speed light enabling electrical signals pass rapidly along current causes several observable which historically were the means recognising its that water could decomposed the current from voltaic pile was discovered nicholson and carlisle process now known electrolysis their work was greatly expanded upon michael faraday current through resistance causes localised effect james prescott joule studied mathematically one the most important discoveries relating current was made accidentally hans christian rsted when while preparing witnessed the current wire disturbing the needle magnetic had discovered electromagnetism fundamental interaction between electricity and the level electromagnetic emissions generated electric arcing high enough produce electromagnetic interference which can detrimental the workings adjacent engineering household current often described being either direct current alternating current these terms refer how the current varies direct produced example from battery and required most electronic devices unidirectional flow from the positive part circuit the most this flow carried they will travelling the opposite alternating current any current that reverses direction almost always this takes the form sine wave alternating current thus pulses back and forth within conductor without the charge moving any net distance over the averaged value alternating current but delivers energy first one and then the alternating current affected electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct such inductance and capacitance these properties however can become important when circuitry subjected transients such when first electric field main electric field see electrostatics the concept the electric field was introduced michael faraday electric field created charged body the space that surrounds and results force exerted any other charges placed within the the electric field acts between two charges similar manner the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses and like extends towards infinity and shows inverse square relationship with however there important gravity always acts drawing two masses while the electric field can result either attraction since large bodies such planets generally carry net the electric field distance usually thus gravity the dominant force distance the despite being much electric field generally varies and its strength any one point defined the force per unit that would felt negligible charge placed that the conceptual termed test charge must vanishingly small prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also stationary prevent the effect magnetic fields the electric field defined terms force and force vector follows that electric field also having both magnitude and direction specifically vector field the study electric fields created stationary charges called electrostatics the field may visualised set imaginary lines whose direction any point the same that the this concept was introduced whose term lines force still sometimes sees the field lines are the paths that point positive charge would seek make was forced move within the they are however imaginary concept with physical and the field permeates all the intervening space between the field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key first that they originate positive charges and terminate negative second that they must enter any good conductor right and that they may never cross nor close hollow conducting body carries all its charge its outer the field therefore zero all places inside the this the operating principal the faraday cage conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical the principles electrostatics are important when designing items high voltage equipment there finite limit the electric field strength that may withstood any beyond this electrical breakdown occurs and electric arc causes flashover between the charged air for tends arc across small gaps electric field strengths which exceed per over larger its breakdown strength perhaps per the most visible natural occurrence this lightning caused when charge becomes separated the clouds rising columns and raises the electric field the air greater than can the voltage large lightning cloud may high and have discharge energies great the field strength greatly affected nearby conducting and particularly intense when forced curve around sharply pointed this principle exploited the lightning conductor the sharp spike which acts encourage the lightning stroke develop rather than the building serves protect electric potential main electric potential see voltage battery cells the concept electric potential closely linked that the electric small charge placed within electric field experiences and have brought that charge that point against the force requires work the electric potential any point defined the energy required bring unit test charge from infinite distance slowly that usually measured volts and one volt the potential for which one joule work must expended bring charge one coulomb from this definition while has little practical and more useful concept that electric potential difference and the energy required move unit charge between two specified electric field has the special property that conservative which means that the path taken the test charge all paths between two specified points expend the same and thus unique value for potential difference may the volt strongly identified the unit choice for measurement and description electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday for practical useful define common reference point which potentials may expressed and while this could much more useful reference the earth itself which assumed the same potential this reference point naturally takes the name earth ground earth assumed infinite source equal amounts positive and negative and therefore electrically and electric potential scalar quantity that has only magnitude and not may viewed analogous height just released object will fall through difference heights caused gravitational charge will across the voltage caused electric relief maps show contour lines marking points equal set lines marking points equal potential known equipotentials may drawn around electrostatically charged the equipotentials cross all lines force right they must also lie parallel conductor otherwise this would produce force that will move the charge carriers even the potential the the electric field was formally defined the force exerted per unit but the concept potential allows for more useful and equivalent the electric field the local gradient the electric usually expressed the vector direction the field the line greatest slope and where the equipotentials lie closest electromagnets electromagnets discovery that magnetic field existed around all sides wire carrying electric current indicated that there was direct relationship between electricity and moreover the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic the two forces nature then the force the compass needle did not direct away from the carrying but acted right angles slightly obscure words were that the electric conflict acts revolving the force also depended the direction the for the flow was then the force did rsted did not fully understand his but observed the effect was current exerts force and magnetic field exerts force the phenomenon was further investigated amp who discovered that two parallel carrying wires exerted force upon each two wires conducting currents the same direction are attracted each while wires containing currents opposite directions are forced the interaction mediated the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition the ampere this relationship between magnetic fields and currents extremely for led michael invention the electric motor faraday homopolar motor consisted permanent magnet sitting pool mercury current was allowed through wire suspended from pivot above the magnet and dipped into the the magnet exerted tangential force the making circle around the magnet for long the current was experimentation faraday revealed that wire moving perpendicular magnetic field developed potential difference between its further analysis this known electromagnetic induction enabled him state the now known faraday law induction that the potential difference induced closed circuit proportional the rate change magnetic flux through the exploitation this discovery enabled him invent the first electrical generator which converted the mechanical energy rotating copper disc electrical faraday disc was inefficient and use practical but showed the possibility generating electric power using possibility that would taken those that followed from his electrochemistry italian physicist alessandro volta battery french emperor napoleon bonaparte electrochemistry the ability chemical reactions produce and conversely the ability electricity drive chemical reactions has wide array electrochemistry has always been important part from the initial invention the voltaic electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types electroplating and electrolysis aluminium produced vast quantities this and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable electric circuits electric circuit electric circuit voltage source current electrical energy resistor electric circuit interconnection electric components such that electric charge made flow along closed path usually perform some useful the components electric circuit can take many which can include elements such resistors capacitors switches transformers and electronics electronic circuits contain active components usually semiconductors and typically exhibit non linear behaviour requiring complex the simplest electric components are those that are termed passive and linear while they may temporarily store they contain sources and exhibit linear responses the resistor perhaps the simplest passive circuit its name resists the current through dissipating its energy the resistance consequence the motion charge through for resistance primarily due collisions between electrons and ohm law basic law circuit theory stating that the current passing through resistance directly proportional the potential difference across the resistance most materials relatively constant over range temperatures and materials under these conditions are known the ohm the unit was named honour georg ohm and symbolised the greek letter the resistance that will produce potential difference one volt response current one the capacitor development the leyden jar and device that can store and thereby storing electrical energy the resulting consists two conducting plates separated thin insulating dielectric layer thin metal foils are coiled increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance the unit capacitance the farad named after michael faraday and given the symbol one farad the capacitance that develops potential difference one volt when stores charge one capacitor connected voltage supply initially causes current accumulates this current will however decay time the capacitor eventually falling capacitor will therefore not permit steady state current but instead blocks the inductor usually coil that stores energy magnetic field response the current through when the current the magnetic field does inducing voltage between the ends the the induced voltage

and transform the mixed components into regular working system electronics distinct from electrical and electro mechanical science and which deals with the distribution switching storage and conversion electrical energy and from other energy forms using wires motors generators batteries switches relays transformers resistors and other passive components this distinction started around with the invention lee forest the triode which made electrical amplification weak radio signals and audio signals possible with mechanical until this field was called radio because its principal application was the design and theory radio transmitters receivers and vacuum tubes today most electronic devices use semiconductor components perform electron the study semiconductor devices and related technology considered branch solid state physics whereas the design and construction electronic circuits solve practical problems come under electronics engineering electromagnetic wave electromagnetic wave and work showed that varying magnetic field acted source electric and varying electric field was source magnetic thus when either field changing then field the other necessarily such phenomenon has the properties wave and naturally referred electromagnetic wave electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically james clerk maxwell maxwell developed set equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric magnetic electric and electric could moreover prove that such wave would necessarily travel the speed light and thus light itself was form electromagnetic maxwell laws which unify fields and charge are one the great milestones theoretical thus the work many researchers enabled the use electronics convert signals into high frequency

generation see electric power transmission and mains electricity budapest hungary hydroelectric gorsky experiments with amber rods were the first studies into the production electrical while this now known the triboelectric effect can lift light objects and generate extremely was not until the invention the voltaic pile the eighteenth century that viable source electricity became the voltaic and its modern the electrical battery store energy chemically and make available demand the form electrical the battery versatile and very common power source which ideally suited many but its energy storage and once discharged must disposed for large electrical demands electrical energy must generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission electrical power usually generated mechanical generators driven steam produced from fossil fuel combustion the heat released from nuclear from other sources such kinetic energy extracted from wind flowing the modern steam turbine invented sir charles parsons today generates about percent the electric power the world using variety heat such generators bear resemblance homopolar disc generator but they still rely his electromagnetic principle that conductor linking changing magnetic field induces potential difference across its the invention the late nineteenth century the transformer meant that electrical power could transmitted more efficiently higher voltage but lower efficient electrical transmission meant turn that electricity could generated centralised power stations where benefited from economies scale and then despatched relatively long distances where was wind power since electrical energy cannot easily stored quantities large enough meet demands national all times exactly much must produced this requires electricity utilities make careful predictions their electrical and maintain constant ordination with their power certain amount generation must always held reserve cushion electrical
