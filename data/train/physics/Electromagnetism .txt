fields with electrical the word electromagnetism compound form two greek terms lektron amber and magnetic from tis which means magnesian type iron ore the science electromagnetic phenomena defined terms the electromagnetic sometimes called the lorentz force which includes both electricity and magnetism elements one during the quark epoch the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force the electromagnetic force plays major role determining the internal properties most objects encountered daily ordinary matter takes its form result intermolecular forces between individual molecules electrons are bound electromagnetic wave mechanics into orbitals around atomic nuclei form atoms which are the building blocks this governs the processes involved chemistry which arise from interactions between the electrons neighboring which are turn determined the interaction between electromagnetic force and the momentum the there are numerous mathematical descriptions the electromagnetic field classical electrodynamics electric fields are described electric potential and electric current ohm law magnetic fields are associated with electromagnetic induction and magnetism and maxwell equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered each other and charges and the theoretical implications particular the establishment the speed light

history the theory hans christian rsted history electromagnetic theory originally electricity and magnetism were thought two separate this view however with the publication james clerk maxwell treatise electricity and magnetism which the interactions positive and negative charges were shown regulated one there are four main effects resulting from these all which have been clearly demonstrated electric charges attract repel one another with force inversely proportional the square the distance between unlike charges like ones magnetic poles states polarization individual attract repel one another similar way and always come every north pole yoked south electric current wire creates circular magnetic field around the its direction clockwise depending that the current induced loop wire when moved towards away from magnetic magnet moved towards away from the direction current depending that the andr marie while preparing for evening lecture april hans christian rsted made surprising was setting his noticed compass needle deflected from magnetic north when the electric current from the battery was using was switched and this deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides wire carrying electric just light and heat and that confirmed direct relationship between electricity and michael faraday the time rsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation the nor did try represent the phenomenon mathematical however three months later began more intensive soon thereafter published his proving that electric current produces magnetic field flows through the cgs unit magnetic induction oersted named honor his contributions the field james clerk maxwell his findings resulted intensive research throughout the scientific community electrodynamics they influenced french physicist andr marie developments single mathematical form represent the magnetic forces between carrying discovery also represented major step toward unified concept this which was observed michael faraday extended james clerk maxwell and partially reformulated oliver heaviside and heinrich hertz one the key accomplishments century mathematical physics had reaching one which was the understanding the nature light unlike what was proposed light and other electromagnetic waves are the present seen taking the form quantized self propagating oscillatory electromagnetic field disturbances which have been called photons different frequencies oscillation give rise the different forms electromagnetic radiation from radio waves the lowest visible light intermediate gamma rays the highest rsted was not the only person examine the relation between electricity and gian domenico romagnosi italian legal deflected magnetic needle electrostatic actually galvanic current existed the setup and hence electromagnetism was account the discovery was published italian but was largely overlooked the contemporary scientific overview the electromagnetic force one the four known fundamental forces the other fundamental forces the weak nuclear force which binds all known particles the standard model and causes certain forms radioactive decay particle physics though the electroweak interaction the unified description two the four known fundamental interactions electromagnetism and the weak the strong nuclear force which binds quarks form nucleons and binds nucleons form nuclei the gravitational force all other forces friction are ultimately derived from these fundamental forces and momentum carried the movement the electromagnetic force the one responsible for practically all the phenomena one encounters daily life above the nuclear with the exception roughly all the forces involved interactions between atoms can explained the electromagnetic force acting the electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons inside and around the together with how these particles carry momentum their this includes the forces experience pushing pulling ordinary material which come from the intermolecular forces between the individual molecules our bodies and those the also includes all forms chemical phenomena necessary part understanding the atomic intermolecular forces the effective force generated the momentum the movement and that electrons move between interacting carrying momentum with collection electrons becomes more their minimum momentum necessarily increases due the pauli exclusion principle the behaviour matter the molecular scale including its density determined the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated the exchange momentum carried the electrons classical electrodynamics classical electrodynamics the scientist william gilbert proposed his magnete that electricity and while both capable causing attraction and repulsion were distinct mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability disturb compass but the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until benjamin franklin proposed experiments one the first discover and publish link between made electric current and magnetism was romagnosi who noticed that connecting wire across voltaic pile deflected nearby compass needle however the effect did not become widely known until when rsted performed similar work influenced produce theory electromagnetism that set the subject mathematical theory known classical electromagnetism was developed various physicists over the course the culminating the work james clerk maxwell who unified the preceding developments into single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature classical the electromagnetic field obeys set equations known maxwell equations and the electromagnetic force given the lorentz force law one the peculiarities classical electromagnetism that difficult reconcile with classical mechanics but compatible with special according the speed light vacuum universal dependent only the electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability free space this violates galilean invariance standing cornerstone classical one way reconcile the two theories electromagnetism and classical assume the existence luminiferous aether through which the light however subsequent experimental efforts failed detect the presence the after important contributions hendrik lorentz and henri albert einstein solved the problem with the introduction special which replaces classical kinematics with new theory kinematics that compatible with classical for more see history special relativity relativity theory shows that moving frames reference magnetic field transforms field with nonzero electric component and vice thus firmly showing that they are two sides the same and thus the term electromagnetism for more see classical electromagnetism and special relativity and covariant formulation classical electromagnetism photoelectric effect photoelectric effect another paper published that same albert einstein undermined the very foundations classical his theory the photoelectric effect for which won the nobel prize and inspired the idea max planck quanta posited that light could exist discrete like quantities which later came known photons einstein theory the photoelectric effect extended the insights that appeared the solution the ultraviolet catastrophe presented max planck his planck showed that hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation discrete packets quanta which leads finite total energy emitted black body radiation both these results were direct contradiction with the classical view light continuous planck and theories were progenitors quantum mechanics which when formulated necessitated the invention quantum theory this completed the known quantum electrodynamics qed and situations where
