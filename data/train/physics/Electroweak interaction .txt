interactions electromagnetism and the weak interaction although these two forces appear very different everyday low the theory models them two different aspects the same above the unification energy the order gev they would merge into single electroweak force thus the universe hot enough approximately temperature exceeded until shortly after the big bang then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into combined electroweak during the electroweak epoch the electroweak force separated from the strong force during the quark epoch the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak force for contributions the unification the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles abdus salam sheldon glashow and steven weinberg were awarded the nobel prize physics

articles formulation weak isospin weak hypercharge weak mixing angle the unification accomplished under gauge group the corresponding gauge bosons are the three bosons weak isospin from and and the boson weak hypercharge from respectively all which are the standard model the and bosons and the are produced the spontaneous symmetry breaking the electroweak symmetry from caused the higgs mechanism see also higgs boson and are different copies the generator given where the generator called the weak hypercharge and one the generators component weak isospin the spontaneous symmetry breaking causes the and bosons coalesce together into two different bosons the boson and the photon where the weak mixing angle the axes representing the particles have essentially just been the plane the angle this also introduces discrepancy between the mass the and the mass the particles denoted and respectively the distinction between electromagnetism and the weak force arises because there linear combination and that vanishes for the higgs boson eigenstate both and the coefficients may taken and defined the group generated this linear and unbroken because does not interact with the lagrangian before electroweak symmetry breaking the lagrangian for the electroweak interactions divided into four parts before electroweak symmetry breaking the term describes the interaction between the three particles and the where and are the field strength tensors for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge the kinetic term for the standard model the interaction the gauge bosons and the fermions are through the gauge covariant derivative where the subscript runs over the three generations and are the handed right handed singlet and right handed singlet down quark and and are the handed doublet and handed singlet electron the term describes the higgs field the term gives the yukawa interaction that generates the fermion masses after the higgs acquires vacuum expectation after electroweak symmetry breaking the lagrangian reorganizes itself after the higgs boson acquires vacuum expectation due its this lagrangian best described breaking into several parts the kinetic term contains all the quadratic terms the which include the dynamic terms the partial and the mass terms conspicuously absent from the lagrangian before symmetry where the sum runs over all the fermions the theory quarks and and the fields and are given the neutral current and charged current components the lagrangian contain the interactions between the fermions and gauge where the electromagnetic current and the neutral weak current are and and are the electric charges and weak the charged current part the lagrangian given contains the higgs point and point self interaction contains the higgs interactions with gauge vector contains the gauge point self contains the gauge point self interactions and contains the yukawa interactions between the fermions and the higgs note the factors the weak these factors project out the left handed components the spinor this why electroweak theory after symmetry commonly said chiral theory see also fundamental forces formulation the standard model weinberg
