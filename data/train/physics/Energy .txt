other forms energy can transformed the other direction into thermal energy without such there are many forms energy but all these types must meet certain conditions such being convertible other kinds obeying conservation and causing proportional change mass objects that possess common energy forms include the kinetic energy moving the radiant energy carried light and other electromagnetic radiation the potential energy stored virtue the position object force field such gravitational electric magnetic field and the thermal energy comprising the microscopic kinetic and potential energies the disordered motions the particles making some specific forms potential energy include elastic energy due the stretching deformation solid objects and chemical energy such released when fuel any

phenomenon appears violate the law energy conservation new forms are typically added that account for the heat and work are special cases that they are not properties but are instead properties processes that transfer general cannot measure how much heat work are present but rather only how much energy transferred among objects certain ways during the occurrence given heat and work are measured positive negative depending which side the transfer view them potential energies are often measured positive negative depending whether they are greater less than the energy specified base state configuration such two interacting bodies being infinitely far wave energies such radiant sound kinetic and rest energy are each greater than equal zero because they are measured comparison base

since the collapse destroyed supernova stars created these cosmology cosmology and astronomy the phenomena stars nova supernova quasars and gamma ray bursts are the output energy transformations all stellar phenomena including solar are driven various kinds energy energy such transformations either from gravitational collapse matter usually molecular into various classes astronomical objects black etc from nuclear fusion lighter primarily the nuclear fusion hydrogen the sun also releases another store potential energy which was created the time the big bang that according space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen completely fuse into heavier this meant that hydrogen represents store potential energy that can released such fusion process triggered heat and

the the case electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta light photons relativity when calculating kinetic energy work accelerate mass from zero speed some finite relativistically using lorentz transformations instead newtonian mechanics einstein discovered unexpected product these calculations energy term which does not vanish zero called rest mass energy energy which every mass must possess even when being the amount energy directly proportional the mass where speed light for consider electron positron annihilation which the rest mass individual particles but the inertia equivalent the system the two particles its invariant mass remains since all energy associated with and this inertia and invariant mass carried off photons which individually are but system retain their this reversible process the inverse process called pair creation which the rest mass particles created from energy two annihilating this system the matter electrons and destroyed and changed matter energy the however the total system mass and energy not change during this general the stress energy tensor serves the source term for the gravitational rough analogy the way mass serves the source term the relativistic newtonian not uncommon hear that energy equivalent would more accurate state that every energy has inertia and gravity and because mass form then mass too has inertia and gravity associated with classical physics energy scalar the canonical conjugate special relativity energy also scalar although not lorentz scalar but time component the energy momentum vector other energy invariant with respect rotations space but not invariant with respect rotations space time boosts transformation energy transformation energy may transformed between different forms various efficiencies items that transform between these forms are called transducers examples transducers include from chemical energy electric energy gravitational potential energy kinetic energy moving water and the blades turbine and ultimately electric energy through electric generator there are strict limits how efficiently energy can converted into other forms energy via work and heat described carnot theorem and the second law thermodynamics these limits are especially evident when engine used perform however some energy transformations can quite the direction transformations energy what kind energy transformed what other often determined entropy equal energy spread among all available degrees freedom considerations practice all energy transformations are permitted small but certain larger transformations are not permitted because statistically unlikely that energy matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms smaller energy transformations the universe over time are characterized various kinds potential energy that has been available since the big bang later being released transformed more active types energy such kinetic radiant when triggering mechanism familiar examples such processes include nuclear which energy released that was originally stored heavy isotopes such uranium and thorium nucleosynthesis process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse supernovae store energy the creation these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the this energy triggered

pendulum its highest points the kinetic energy zero and the gravitational potential energy its lowest point the kinetic energy maximum and equal the decrease potential energy one assumes that there friction other the conversion energy between these processes would and the pendulum would continue swinging energy also transferred from potential energy kinetic energy and then back potential energy this referred conservation this closed energy cannot created therefore the initial energy and the final energy will equal each this can demonstrated the the equation can then simplified further since mass times acceleration due gravity times the and mass times velocity then the total amount energy can found adding conservation energy and mass transformation energy gives rise weight when trapped system with zero where can also equivalent and this mass always associated with mass also equivalent certain amount and likewise always appears associated with described mass energy equivalence the formula derived albert einstein quantifies the relationship between mass and energy within the concept special different theoretical similar formulas were derived thomson henri friedrich hrl and others see mass energy history for further matter may converted energy and vice but mass cannot ever rather mass energy equivalence remains constant for both the matter and the during any process when they are converted into each however since extremely large relative ordinary human the conversion ordinary amount matter for other forms energy such light and other can liberate tremendous amounts

likewise whenever energy transferred between systems any associated mass transferred with quantum mechanics energy expressed using the hamiltonian operator any time the uncertainty the energy which similar form the heisenberg uncertainty principle but not really mathematically equivalent since and are not dynamically conjugate neither classical nor quantum particle physics this inequality permits qualitative understanding virtual particles which carry momentum exchange which and with real responsible for the creation all known fundamental forces more accurately known fundamental

transfer usually refers movements energy between systems which are closed transfers the portion the energy which transferred conservative forces over distance measured the work the source system does the receiving the portion the energy which does not work doing during the transfer called heat energy can transferred between systems variety examples include the transmission electromagnetic energy via physical collisions which transfer kinetic energy and the conductive transfer thermal energy energy strictly conserved and also locally conserved wherever can mathematically the process energy
