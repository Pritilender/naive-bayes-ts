dinger sommerfeld von neumann weyl wien wigner zeeman zeilinger quantum mechanical system particle that bound that confined can only take certain discrete values this contrasts with classical particles which can have any these discrete values are called energy levels the term commonly used for the energy levels electrons atoms ions molecules which are bound the electric field the nucleus but can also refer energy levels nuclei vibrational rotational energy levels the energy spectrum system with such discrete energy levels said quantized the potential energy set zero infinite distance from the atomic nucleus the usual then bound electron states have negative potential ion molecule the lowest possible energy and its electrons are said the ground state higher energy said excited any electrons that have higher energy than the ground state are excited more than one quantum mechanical state the same the energy levels are degenerate they are then called degenerate energy levels

stationary states with energies corresponding integral numbers wavelengths clarification needed can for other states the waves interfere destructively clarification needed resulting zero probability density elementary examples that show mathematically how energy levels come about are the particle box and the quantum harmonic oscillator history the first evidence quantization atoms was the observation spectral lines light from the sun the early joseph von fraunhofer and william hyde wollaston the notion energy levels was proposed danish physicist niels bohr the bohr theory the the modern quantum mechanical theory given explanation these energy levels terms the schr dinger equation was advanced erwin dinger and werner heisenberg atoms intrinsic energy levels the formulas for energy electrons various levels given below the zero point for energy set when the electron question has completely left the when the principal quantum number when the electron bound the atom any closer value the energy lower and considered orbital state energy atom ion with nucleus one electron assume there one electron given atomic orbital hydrogen like atom the energy its state mainly determined the electrostatic interaction the electron with the nucleus the energy levels electron around nucleus are given typically between and where the rydberg constant the atomic number the principal quantum number planck constant and the speed light for like atoms only the rydberg levels depend only the principal quantum number this equation obtained from combining the rydberg formula for any like element shown with assuming that the principal quantum number above the rydberg formula and principal quantum number the energy level the electron descends when emitting photon the rydberg formula was derived from empirical spectroscopic emission data equivalent formula can derived quantum mechanically from the independent schr dinger equation with kinetic energy hamiltonian operator using wave function eigenfunction obtain the energy levels eigenvalues but the rydberg constant would replaced other fundamental physics multi electron atoms include electrostatic interaction electron with other electrons there more than one electron around the electron interactions raise the energy these interactions are often neglected the spatial overlap the electron wavefunctions for electron interactions between electrons cause the preceding equation longer accurate stated simply with the atomic number simple though not way understand this shielding effect where the outer electrons see effective nucleus reduced since the inner electrons are bound tightly the nucleus and partially cancel its this leads approximate correction where substituted with effective nuclear charge symbolized that depends strongly the principal quantum such the orbital types determined the azimuthal quantum number well their levels within the molecule affect and therefore also affect the various atomic electron energy the aufbau principle filling atom with electrons for electron configuration takes these differing energy levels into for filling atom with electrons the ground state the lowest energy levels are filled first and consistent with the pauli exclusion principle the aufbau principle and hund rule fine structure splitting fine structure arises from relativistic kinetic energy spin orbit coupling electrodynamic interaction between the spin and motion and the electric and the darwin term contact term interaction shell electrons inside the these affect the levels typical order magnitude hyperfine structure hyperfine structure this even finer structure due nucleus spin spin interaction resulting typical change the energy levels typical order magnitude energy levels due external fields zeeman effect zeeman effect there interaction energy associated with the magnetic dipole arising from the electronic orbital angular given with additionally taking into account the magnetic momentum arising from the electron due relativistic effects dirac equation there magnetic arising from the electron spin with the spin factor about resulting total magnetic the interaction energy therefore becomes stark effect stark effect molecules chemical bonds between atoms molecule form because they make the situation more stable for the involved which generally means the sum energy level for the involved atoms the molecule lower than the atoms were not separate atoms approach each other covalently bond their orbitals affect each energy levels form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals the energy level the bonding orbitals and the energy level the antibonding orbitals for the bond the molecule the covalent bonding electrons occupy the lower energy bonding which may signified such symbols depending the corresponding bonding orbitals can signified adding asterisk get orbitals non bonding orbital molecule orbital with electrons outer shells which not participate bonding and its energy level the same that the constituent such orbitals can designated orbitals the electrons orbital are typically lone pairs polyatomic different vibrational and rotational energy levels are also roughly molecular energy state eigenstate the molecular hamiltonian the sum the vibrational rotational nuclear and translational such where eigenvalue the electronic molecular hamiltonian the value the potential energy surface the equilibrium geometry the molecule the molecular energy levels are labelled the molecular term symbols the specific energies these components vary with the specific energy state and the molecular physics and quantum chemistry energy level quantized energy bound quantum mechanical state energy level diagrams there are various types energy level diagrams for bonds between atoms molecular orbital diagrams jablonski diagrams condon energy level transitions atomic electron transition molecular electron transition electrons atoms and molecules can change make transitions energy levels emitting absorbing photon electromagnetic radiation whose energy must exactly equal the energy difference between the two electrons can also completely removed from chemical species such molecule ion complete removal electron from atom can form ionization which effectively moving the electron out orbital with infinite principal quantum number effect far away have practically more effect the remaining atom for various types there are etc ionization energies for removing the then the then the etc the highest energy respectively from the atom originally the ground state energy corresponding opposite quantities can also sometimes the form photon when electrons are added positively charged ions sometimes molecules can also undergo transitions their vibrational rotational energy energy level transitions can also meaning emission absorption photon not ion molecule the lowest possible energy and its electrons are said the ground state higher energy said excited any electrons that have higher energy than the ground state are excited such species can excited higher energy level absorbing photon whose energy equal the energy difference between the conversely excited species can lower energy level spontaneously emitting photon equal the energy energy equal planck constant times its frequency and thus proportional its inversely its wavelength since the speed equals correspondingly many kinds spectroscopy are based detecting the frequency wavelength the emitted absorbed photons provide information the material including information the energy levels and electronic structure materials obtained analyzing the spectrum asterisk commonly used designate excited electron transition bond from ground state excited state may have designation such meaning excitation electron from bonding antibonding orbital from bonding antibonding from bonding antibonding reverse electron transitions for all these types excited molecules are also possible return their ground which can designated transition energy level electron molecule may combined with vibrational transition and called vibronic transition vibrational and rotational transition may combined rovibrational coupling rovibronic coupling electron transitions are simultaneously combined with both vibrational and rotational photons involved transitions may have energy various ranges the electromagnetic such ray ultraviolet visible light infrared microwave radiation depending the type very general energy level differences between electronic states are differences between vibrational levels are and differences between rotational levels are although there can translational energy levels are practically continuous and can calculated kinetic energy using classical mechanics higher temperature causes fluid atoms and molecules move faster increasing their translational and thermally excites molecules higher average amplitudes vibrational and rotational modes excites the molecules higher internal energy this means that temperature translational vibrational and rotational contributions molecular heat capacity let molecules absorb heat and hold more internal energy conduction heat typically occurs molecules atoms collide transferring the heat between each even higher electrons can thermally excited higher energy orbitals atoms subsequent drop electron lower energy level can release causing possibly colored electron farther from the nucleus has higher potential energy than electron closer the thus becomes less bound the since its potential energy negative and inversely dependent its distance from the crystalline materials crystalline solids are found have energy bands instead addition energy electrons can take any energy within unfilled first this appears exception the requirement for energy however shown band theory energy bands are actually made many discrete energy levels which are too close together within band the number levels the order the number atoms the although electrons are actually restricted these they appear able take continuum the important energy levels crystal are the top the valence band the bottom the conduction band the fermi level the vacuum level and the energy levels any defect states the see also perturbation theory quantum computational chemistry
