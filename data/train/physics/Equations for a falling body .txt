equations describe the resultant trajectories when objects move owing constant gravitational force under normal earth bound for newton law universal gravitation simplifies where the mass the this assumption reasonable for objects falling earth over the relatively short vertical distances our everyday but very much untrue over larger such spacecraft please note that this article any resistance from air drag contents history overview acceleration relative the rotating earth see also notes external links history the equations ignore air which has dramatic effect objects falling appreciable distance causing them quickly approach terminal velocity the effect air resistance varies enormously depending the size and geometry the falling object for the equations are hopelessly wrong for which has low mass but offers large resistance the the absence atmosphere all objects fall the same astronaut david scott demonstrated dropping hammer and feather the surface the moon the equations also ignore the rotation the failing describe the coriolis effect for nevertheless they are usually accurate enough for dense and compact objects falling over heights not exceeding the tallest made overview near the surface the use meters per second which might thought meters per per feet per second per approximately for other multiply the appropriate scaling factor coherent set units for and assuming units measured meters per second must measured seconds and meters per all the body assumed start from and air resistance generally all results below will therefore quite inaccurate after only seconds fall which time velocity will little less than the vacuum value due air air resistance induces drag force any body that falls through any atmosphere other than perfect and this drag force increases with velocity until equals the gravitational leaving the object fall constant terminal velocity atmospheric the coefficient drag for the the velocity the and the area presented the airflow determine terminal velocity apart from the last these formulas also assume that negligibly varies with height during the fall that they assume constant the last equation more accurate where significant changes fractional distance from the center the planet during the fall cause significant changes this equation occurs many applications basic example the first equation shows after one object will have fallen distance meters after two seconds will have fallen meters and the second last equation becomes grossly inaccurate great object fell meters then the results both equations differ only however fell from geosynchronous orbit which then the difference changes almost additional based wind for the terminal velocity skydiver earth face free fall position about mph this velocity the asymptotic limiting value the acceleration because the effective forces the body balance each other more and more closely the terminal velocity this speed terminal velocity reached after only about seconds while takes seconds reach seconds reach and higher speeds can attained the skydiver pulls his her limbs see also this the terminal velocity increases about mph which almost the terminal velocity the peregrine falcon diving down its the same terminal velocity reached for typical bullet dropping when returning earth having been fired dropped from according army ordnance competition speed skydivers fly the head down position and reach even higher the current world record mach felix baumgartner who skydived from above earth october the record was set due the high altitude where the lesser density the atmosphere decreased examples for astronomical bodies other than earth and for short distances fall other than ground level the above equations may replaced where the gravitational constant the mass the astronomical the mass the falling and the radius from the falling object the center the removing the simplifying assumption uniform gravitational acceleration provides more accurate find from the formula for radial elliptic trajectories the time taken for object fall from height height measured from the centers the two given where the sum the standard gravitational parameters the two this equation should used whenever there significant difference the gravitational acceleration during the acceleration relative the rotating earth centripetal force causes the acceleration measured the rotating surface the earth differ from the acceleration that measured for falling the apparent acceleration the rotating frame reference the total gravity vector minus small vector toward the south axis the corresponding staying stationary that frame see also gravitation portal gravitation equations motion radial trajectory
