bardeen cooper schrieffer josephson kohn kadanoff fisher fermi liquid theory also known landau fermi liquid theory theoretical model interacting fermions that describes the normal state most metals sufficiently low the interaction between the particles the body system does not need the phenomenological theory fermi liquids was introduced the soviet physicist lev davidovich landau and later developed alexei abrikosov and khalatnikov using diagrammatic perturbation theory the theory explains why some the properties interacting fermion system are very similar those the fermi gas non interacting and why other properties important examples where fermi liquid theory has been successfully applied are most notably electrons most metals and liquid liquid fermi liquid low temperatures but not low enough its superfluid phase isotope helium with protons neutron and electrons per because there odd number fermions inside the the atom itself also the electrons normal superconducting metal also form fermi the nucleons protons and neutrons atomic nucleus strontium ruthenate displays some key properties fermi despite being strongly correlated material and compared with high temperature superconductors like cuprates contents description similarities fermi gas differences from fermi gas energy specific heat and compressibility interactions structure distribution electrical resistance optical response instabilities the fermi liquid non fermi liquids references see also description the key ideas behind theory are the notion adiabaticity and the exclusion principle consider interacting fermion system fermi gas and suppose turn the interaction landau argued that this the ground state the fermi gas would adiabatically transform into the ground state the interacting exclusion the ground state fermi gas consists fermions occupying all momentum states corresponding momentum with all higher momentum states interaction turned the charge and momentum the fermions corresponding the occupied states remain while their dynamical such their magnetic moment are renormalized new thus there one correspondence between the elementary excitations fermi gas system and fermi liquid the context fermi these excitations are called landau quasiparticles are lived excitations with lifetime that satisfies where the fermi energy for this the green function can written near its the form where the chemical potential and the energy corresponding the given momentum the value called the quasiparticle residue and very characteristic fermi liquid the spectral function for the system can directly observed via arpes experiment and can written the limit lying the where the fermi physically can say that propagating fermion interacts with its surrounding such way that the net effect the interactions make the fermion behave dressed fermion altering its effective mass and other dynamical these dressed fermions are what think quasiparticles another important property fermi liquids related the scattering cross section for suppose have electron with energy above the fermi and suppose scatters with particle the fermi sea with energy exclusion both the particles after scattering have lie above the fermi with energies now suppose the initial electron has energy very close the fermi surface then have that also have very close the fermi this reduces the phase space volume the possible states after and fermi golden rule the scattering cross section goes thus can say that the lifetime particles the fermi surface goes similarities fermi gas the fermi liquid qualitatively analogous the interacting fermi gas the following the dynamics and thermodynamics low excitation energies and temperatures may described substituting the interacting fermions with interacting quasiparticles each which carries the same spin charge and momentum the original physically these may thought being particles whose motion disturbed the surrounding particles and which themselves perturb the particles their each particle excited state the interacting system may described listing all occupied momentum just the interacting quantities such the heat capacity the fermi liquid behave qualitatively the same way the fermi gas the heat capacity rises linearly with differences from fermi gas the following differences the interacting fermi gas energy the energy particle state not simply sum the particle energies all occupied instead the change energy for given change occupation states contains terms both linear and quadratic for the fermi would only where denotes the particle the linear contribution corresponds renormalized particle which change the effective mass the quadratic terms correspond sort interaction between which parameterized called landau fermi liquid parameters and determines the behaviour density oscillations and density the fermi still these field interactions not lead scattering particles with transfer particles between different momentum specific heat and compressibility specific heat compressibility spin susceptibility and other quantities show the same qualitative behaviour dependence the fermi but the magnitude sometimes changed interactions addition the field some weak interactions between quasiparticles which lead scattering quasiparticles off each therefore quasiparticles acquire finite however low enough energies above the fermi this lifetime becomes very such that the product excitation energy expressed and lifetime much larger than this the quasiparticle energy still defined the opposite heisenberg uncertainty relation would prevent accurate definition the structure the structure the bare particle opposed green function similar that the fermi gas for given the function frequency space delta peak the respective particle the delta peak the states broadened with width given the quasiparticle addition and contrast the quasiparticle its weight integral over suppressed quasiparticle weight factor the remainder the total weight broad incoherent corresponding the strong effects interactions the fermions short distribution the distribution particles opposed over momentum states zero temperature still shows discontinuous jump the fermi surface the fermi but does not drop from the step only size electrical resistance metal the resistance low temperatures dominated electron scattering combination with umklapp scattering for fermi the resistance from this mechanism varies which often taken experimental check for fermi liquid behaviour addition the linear dependence the specific although only arises combination with the optical response fermi liquid theory predicts that the scattering which governs the optical response not only depends quadratically temperature thus causing the dependence the but also depends quadratically this contrast the drude prediction for interacting metallic where the scattering rate constant function instabilities the fermi liquid the experimental observation exotic phases strongly correlated systems has triggered enormous effort from the theoretical community try understand their microscopic one possible route detect instabilities precisely the analysis done due the pomeranchuk instability has been studied several authors with different techniques the last few years and the instability the towards the nematic phase was investigated for several non fermi liquids the term non fermi liquid used describe system which displays breakdown liquid the simplest example such system the system interacting fermions called luttinger liquid although luttinger liquids are physically similar fermi the restriction one dimension gives rise several qualitative differences such the absence quasiparticle peak the momentum dependent spectral spin charge and the presence spin density waves one cannot ignore the existence interactions dimension and has describe the problem with fermi where luttinger liquid one small finite temperatures dimension the state the system described incoherent luttinger liquid another example such behaviour observed quantum critical points certain order phase transitions such heavy fermion criticality mott criticality and cuprate phase the ground state such transitions characterized the presence sharp fermi although there may not defined that approaching the critical observed that the quasiparticle residue understanding the behaviour fermi liquids important problem condensed matter approaches towards explaining these phenomena include the treatment marginal fermi liquids
