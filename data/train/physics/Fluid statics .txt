fluid statics navigation search cyclopaedia fluid statics hydrostatics the branch fluid mechanics that studies fluids embraces the study the conditions under which fluids are rest stable equilibrium and contrasted with fluid dynamics the study fluids hydrostatics fundamental hydraulics the engineering equipment for transporting and using also relevant geophysics and astrophysics for understanding plate tectonics and the anomalies the earth gravitational field meteorology medicine the context blood pressure and many other hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena everyday such why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude why wood and oil float and why the surface water always flat and horizontal whatever the shape its contents history pressure fluids rest hydrostatic pressure atmospheric pressure buoyancy hydrostatic force submerged surfaces liquids fluids with free capillary action hanging drops see also references further reading external links history some principles hydrostatics have been known empirical and intuitive sense since the builders cisterns aqueducts and fountains archimedes credited with the discovery the mathematical law that bears his name that relates the buoyancy force the volume and density the displaced the roman engineer vitruvius warned readers about lead pipes bursting under hydrostatic pressure the concept pressure and the way transmitted fluids were formulated the french mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal pressure fluids rest due the fundamental nature fluid cannot remain rest under the presence shear stress however fluids can exert pressure normal any contacting point the fluid thought infinitesimally small then follows from the principles equilibrium that the pressure every side this unit fluid must this were not the the fluid would move the direction the resulting thus the pressure fluid rest isotropic acts with equal magnitude all this characteristic allows fluids transmit force through the length pipes force applied fluid pipe via the the other end the this principle was first slightly extended blaise and now called pascal law hydrostatic pressure vertical pressure variation fluid all frictional stresses vanish and the state stress the system called hydrostatic when this condition applied the navier stokes equation the gradient pressure becomes function body forces for barotropic fluid conservative force field like gravitational force pressure exerted fluid equilibrium becomes function force exerted the hydrostatic pressure can determined from control volume analysis infinitesimally small cube since pressure defined the force exerted test area with pressure force normal area area and the only force acting any such small cube fluid the weight the fluid column above hydrostatic pressure can calculated according the following where the hydrostatic pressure the fluid density gravitational acceleration the test area the height parallel the direction the test area the height the zero reference point the pressure for water and other this integral can simplified significantly for many practical based the following two since many liquids can considered incompressible reasonably good estimation can made from assuming constant density throughout the the same assumption cannot made within gaseous also since the height the fluid column between and often reasonably small compared the radius the one can neglect the variation under these the integral boils down the simple where the height the liquid column between the test volume and the zero reference point the note that this reference point should lie below the surface the otherwise one has split the integral into two terms with the constant and for the absolute pressure compared vacuum where the total height the liquid column above the test area the and the atmospheric pressure the pressure calculated from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface this can easily visualized using pressure prism hydrostatic pressure has been used the preservation foods process called pascalization hydrostatic pressure blood vessels the pressure the blood against the the
