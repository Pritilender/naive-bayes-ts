force can also described intuitive concepts such push force has both magnitude and direction making vector quantity measured the unit newtons and represented the symbol the original form newton second

measurement see also notes references further reading external links development the concept philosophers antiquity used the concept force the study stationary and moving objects and simple machines but thinkers such aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors understanding part this was due incomplete understanding the sometimes obvious force friction and consequently inadequate view the nature natural fundamental error was the belief that force required maintain even constant most the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected sir isaac newton with his mathematical formulated laws motion that were not for nearly three hundred the early einstein developed theory relativity that correctly predicted the action forces objects with increasing momenta near the speed and also provided insight into the forces produced gravitation and inertia with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close the speed particle physics has devised standard model describe forces between particles smaller than the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means which forces are emitted and only four main interactions are order decreasing they strong electromagnetic weak and gravitational high energy particle physics observations made during the and confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions more fundamental electroweak interaction pre newtonian concepts aristotelian physics theory impetus aristotle since antiquity the concept force has been recognized integral the functioning each the simple machines the mechanical advantage given simple machine allowed for less force used exchange for that force acting over greater distance for the same amount work analysis the characteristics forces ultimately culminated the work archimedes who was especially famous for formulating treatment buoyant forces inherent fluids aristotle provided philosophical discussion the concept force integral part aristotelian cosmology the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come rest different natural therein aristotle believed that motionless objects those composed mostly the elements earth and their natural place the ground and that they will stay that way left distinguished between the innate tendency objects find their natural for heavy bodies which led natural and unnatural forced which required continued application this based the everyday experience how objects such the constant application force needed keep cart had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior projectiles such the flight the place where the archer moves the projectile was the start the and while the projectile sailed through the discernible efficient cause acts aristotle was aware this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the path carries the projectile its this explanation demands continuum like air for change place aristotelian physics began facing criticism medieval science first john philoponus the the shortcomings aristotelian physics would not fully corrected until the century work galileo galilei who was influenced the late medieval idea that objects forced motion carried innate force impetus galileo constructed experiment which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down incline disprove the aristotelian theory motion early the showed that the bodies were accelerated gravity extent which was independent their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted for example friction newtonian mechanics newton laws motion sir isaac newton sought describe the motion all objects using the concepts inertia and and doing found that they obey certain conservation laws newton went publish his thesis philosophi naturalis principia mathematica this work newton set out three laws motion that this day are the way forces are described first law newton first law first law motion states that objects continue move state constant velocity unless acted upon external net force resultant force this law extension insight that constant velocity was associated with lack net force see more detailed description this below newton proposed that every object with mass has innate inertia that functions the fundamental equilibrium natural place the aristotelian idea the natural state that the first law contradicts the intuitive aristotelian belief that net force required keep object moving with constant making rest physically indistinguishable from non zero constant velocity newton first law directly connects inertia with the concept relative velocities specifically systems where objects are moving with different impossible determine which object and which object other phrase matters more the laws physics are the same every inertial frame reference that all frames related galilean transformation for while traveling moving vehicle constant velocity the laws physics not change from being person can throw ball straight the air and catch falls down without worrying about applying force the direction the vehicle this true even though another person who observing the moving vehicle pass also observes the ball follow curving parabolic path the same direction the motion the the inertia the ball associated with its constant velocity the direction the motion that ensures the ball continues move forward even thrown and falls back from the perspective the person the the vehicle and everything inside the outside world that moving with constant speed the opposite since there experiment that can distinguish whether the vehicle that rest the outside world that the two situations are considered physically indistinguishable inertia therefore applies equally well constant velocity motion does the concept inertia can further generalized explain the tendency objects continue many different forms constant even those that are not strictly constant the rotational inertia planet earth what fixes the constancy the length day and the length albert einstein extended the principle inertia further when explained that reference frames subject constant such those falling toward gravitating were physically equivalent inertial reference this for astronauts experience weightlessness when fall orbit around the and why laws motion are more easily discernible such astronaut places object with mass air next will remain stationary with respect the astronaut due its this the same thing that would occur the astronaut and the object were intergalactic space with net force gravity acting their shared reference this principle equivalence was one the foundational underpinnings for the development the general theory relativity sir isaac newton differential calculus second law newton second law modern statement second law vector differential equation note where the momentum the and the net vector sum force there zero net force but forces may present the second law states unbalanced force acting object will result the momentum changing over the definition momentum where the mass and the velocity newton second law applies only system constant mass note and hence may moved outside the derivative the equation then becomes substituting the definition acceleration the algebraic version newton second law newton never explicitly stated the formula the reduced form newton second law asserts the direct proportionality acceleration force and the inverse proportionality acceleration accelerations can defined through kinematic measurements however while kinematics are described through reference frame analysis advanced there are still deep questions that remain what the proper definition general relativity offers equivalence between space time and but lacking coherent theory quantum gravity unclear how whether this connection relevant with some newton second law can taken quantitative definition mass writing the law the relative units force and mass then are the use second law definition force has been disparaged some the more rigorous because essentially mathematical truism notable philosophers and mathematicians who have sought more explicit definition the concept force include ernst mach clifford truesdell citation needed and walter noll newton second law can used measure the strength for knowledge the masses planets along with the accelerations their orbits allows scientists calculate the gravitational forces third law newton third law third law result applying symmetry situations where forces can attributed the presence different the third law means that all forces are interactions between different note and thus that there such thing unidirectional force force that acts only one whenever first body exerts force second the second body exerts force the first and are equal magnitude and opposite this law sometimes referred the action reaction law with called the action and the reaction the action and the reaction are object and object are considered the same then the net force the system due the interactions between objects and zero since this means that closed system there are internal forces that are that the reaction force shared between any two objects closed system will not cause the center mass the system the constituent objects only accelerate with respect each the system itself remains alternatively external force acts the then the center mass will experience acceleration proportional the magnitude the external force divided the mass the combining second and third possible show that the linear momentum system conserved using and integrating with respect the for system which includes objects and which the conservation linear using the similar possible generalize this system arbitrary number this shows that exchanging momentum between constituent objects will not affect the net momentum long all forces are due the interaction objects with possible define system such that net momentum never lost nor special theory relativity the special theory relativity mass and energy are equivalent can seen calculating the work required accelerate when velocity does its energy and hence its mass equivalent thus requires more force accelerate the same amount than did lower newton second law remains valid because mathematical but order relativistic momentum must redefined where speed light rest mass the relativistic expression relating force and acceleration for particle with constant zero rest mass moving the direction where the lorentz factor the early history the expressions and were called longitudinal and transverse mass relativistic force does not produce constant but ever decreasing acceleration the object approaches the speed note that undefined for object with zero rest mass the speed and the theory yields prediction that one however restore the form for use relativity through the use four vectors this relation correct relativity when the four force the invariant mass and the four acceleration descriptions diagrams inclined plane since forces are perceived pushes this can provide intuitive understanding for describing with other physical concepts temperature the intuitive understanding forces quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared standard measurement scale through determined that laboratory measurements forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition force offered newtonian mechanics forces act particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push pull because these forces are classified vector quantities this means that forces follow different set mathematical rules than physical quantities that not have direction denoted scalar quantities for when determining what happens when two forces act the same necessary know both the magnitude and the direction both forces calculate the result both these pieces information are not known for each the situation for you know that two people are pulling the same rope with known magnitudes force but you not know which direction either person impossible determine what the acceleration the rope will the two people could pulling against each other tug war the two people could pulling the same this simple one dimensional example without knowing the direction the forces impossible decide whether the net force the result adding the two force magnitudes subtracting one from the associating forces with vectors avoids such historically forces were first quantitatively investigated conditions static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities they have magnitude and when two forces act point particle the resulting the resultant also called the net force can determined following the parallelogram rule vector addition the addition two vectors represented sides gives equivalent resultant vector which equal magnitude and direction the transversal the the magnitude the resultant varies from the difference the magnitudes the two forces their depending the angle between their lines however the forces are acting extended their respective lines application must also specified order account for their effects the motion the free body diagrams can used convenient way keep track forces acting ideally these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes the force vectors preserved that graphical vector addition can done determine the net well being forces can also resolved into independent components right angles each horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore split into two one pointing and one pointing summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original resolving force vectors into components set basis vectors often more mathematically clean way describe forces than using magnitudes and this for orthogonal components the components the vector sum are uniquely determined the scalar addition the components the individual orthogonal components are independent each other because forces acting ninety degrees each other have effect the magnitude direction the choosing set orthogonal basis vectors often done considering what set basis vectors will make the mathematics most choosing basis vector that the same direction one the forces since that force would then have only one zero orthogonal force vectors can dimensional with the third component being angles the other equilibrium equilibrium occurs when the resultant force acting point particle zero that the vector sum all forces when dealing with extended also necessary that the net torque there are two kinds static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium static statics static equilibrium static equilibrium was understood well before the invention classical objects which are rest have zero net force acting the simplest case static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal magnitude but opposite for object level surface pulled downward toward the center the earth the force the same surface forces resist the downward force with equal upward force called the normal force the situation one zero net force and pushing against object frictional surface can result situation where the object does not move because the applied force opposed static friction generated between the object and the table for situation with the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting the static friction increases decreases response the applied force upper limit determined the characteristics the contact between the surface and the static equilibrium between two forces the most usual way measuring using simple devices such weighing scales and spring balances for object suspended vertical spring scale experiences the force gravity acting the object balanced force applied the spring reaction which equals the using such some quantitative force laws were that the force gravity proportional volume for objects constant density widely exploited for millennia define standard archimedes principle for archimedes analysis the lever boyle law for gas and hooke law for these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws motion dynamic dynamics galileo galilei dynamic equilibrium was first described galileo who noticed that certain assumptions aristotelian physics were contradicted observations and logic galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept absolute rest frame did not galileo concluded that motion constant velocity was completely equivalent this was contrary notion natural rest that objects with mass naturally simple experiments showed that understanding the equivalence constant velocity and rest were for mariner dropped cannonball from the nest ship moving constant aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath thus aristotelian the falling cannonball would land behind the foot the mast moving however when this experiment actually the cannonball always falls the foot the the cannonball knows travel with the ship despite being separated from since there forward horizontal force being applied the cannonball the only conclusion left that the cannonball continues move with the same velocity the boat thus force required keep the cannonball moving the constant forward moreover any object traveling constant velocity must subject zero net force resultant this the definition dynamic when all the forces object balance but still moves constant simple case dynamic equilibrium occurs constant velocity motion across surface with kinetic friction such force applied the direction motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied this results zero net but since the object started with zero continues move with zero aristotle misinterpreted this motion being caused the applied however when kinetic friction taken into consideration clear that there net force causing constant velocity feynman diagrams feynman diagrams boson modern particle physics forces and the acceleration particles are explained mathematical product exchange carrying gauge bosons with the development quantum field theory and general relativity was realized that force redundant concept arising from conservation momentum momentum relativity and momentum virtual particles quantum electrodynamics the conservation can directly derived from homogeneity shift space and usually considered more fundamental than the concept thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately fundamental interactions when particle emits absorbs virtual particle momentum conservation results recoil particle making impression repulsion attraction between particles exchanging this description applies all forces arising from fundamental while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed full the accurate result such there conceptually simple way describe such interactions through the use feynman feynman each matter particle represented straight line see world line traveling through time which normally increases the right the matter and matter particles are identical except for their direction propagation through the feynman world lines particles intersect interaction and the feynman diagram represents any force arising from interaction occurring the vertex with associated instantaneous change the direction the particle world gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex wavy lines the case virtual particle are absorbed adjacent the utility feynman diagrams that other types physical phenomena that are part the general picture fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also described using the same for feynman diagram can describe succinct detail how neutron decays into electron proton and neutrino interaction mediated the same gauge boson that responsible for the weak nuclear force fundamental models fundamental interaction all the forces the universe are based four fundamental interactions the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only very short and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles including nucleons and compound nuclei the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges and the gravitational force acts between masses all other forces nature derive from these four fundamental for friction manifestation the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms two surfaces and the pauli exclusion principle which does not permit atoms pass through each similarly the forces springs modeled hooke law are the result electromagnetic forces and the exclusion principle acting together return object its equilibrium position centrifugal forces are acceleration forces which arise simply from the acceleration rotating frames reference the development fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines unification disparate for isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling the surface the earth with the force responsible for the orbits celestial mechanics his universal theory michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory the the development quantum mechanics led modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces all except are manifestations matter fermions interacting exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons this standard model particle physics posits similarity between the forces and led scientists predict the unification the weak and electromagnetic forces electroweak theory subsequently confirmed the complete formulation the standard model predicts yet unobserved higgs mechanism but observations such neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model grand unified theory allowing for the combination the electroweak interaction with the strong force held out possibility with candidate theories such supersymmetry proposed accommodate some the outstanding unsolved problems physics physicists are still attempting develop consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into theory everything einstein tried and failed this but currently the most popular approach answering this question string theory gravity gravity stroboscope what now call gravity was not identified universal force until the work isaac before the tendency for objects fall towards the earth was not understood related the motions celestial galileo was instrumental describing the characteristics falling objects determining that the acceleration every object free fall was constant and independent the mass the today this acceleration due gravity towards the surface the earth usually designated and has magnitude about meters per second squared this measurement taken from sea level and may vary depending and points toward the center the this observation means that the force gravity object the surface directly proportional the thus object that has mass will experience this force unopposed and therefore the net force the object its for objects not the force gravity opposed the reactions their for person standing the ground experiences zero net since his weight balanced normal force exerted the newton contribution gravitational theory was unify the motions heavenly which aristotle had assumed were natural state constant with falling motion observed the proposed law gravity that could account for the celestial motions that had been described earlier using kepler laws planetary motion newton came realize that the effects gravity might observed different ways larger newton determined that the acceleration the moon around the earth could ascribed the same force gravity the acceleration due gravity decreased inverse square law further newton realized that the acceleration due gravity proportional the mass the attracting combining these ideas gives formula that relates the mass and the radius the earth the gravitational where the vector direction given the unit vector directed outward from the center the this dimensional constant used describe the relative strength this constant has come known newton universal gravitation constant though its value was unknown not until was henry cavendish able make the first measurement using torsion balance this was widely reported the press measurement the mass the earth since knowing could allow one solve for the mass given the above newton however realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws motion his law gravity had succinctly newton law gravitation states that the force spherical object mass due the gravitational pull mass where the distance between the two centers mass and the unit vector pointed the direction away from the center the first object toward the center the second this formula was powerful enough stand the basis for all subsequent descriptions motion within the solar system until the during that sophisticated methods perturbation analysis were invented calculate the deviations orbits due the influence multiple bodies planet moon comet asteroid the formalism was exact enough allow mathematicians predict the existence the planet neptune before was was only the orbit the planet mercury that law gravitation seemed not fully some astrophysicists predicted the existence another planet vulcan that would explain the however despite some early such planet could when albert einstein formulated his theory general relativity turned his attention the problem orbit and found that his theory added correction which could account for the discrepancy this was the first time that theory gravity had been shown less correct than since and general relativity has been acknowledged the theory which best explains gravitation not viewed but objects moving freely gravitational fields travel under their own inertia straight lines through curved time defined the shortest time path between two time from the perspective the all motion occurs there were gravitation only when observing the motion global sense that the curvature time can observed and the force inferred from the curved thus the straight line path time seen curved line and called the ballistic trajectory the for basketball thrown from the ground moves parabola uniform gravitational its time trajectory when the extra dimension almost straight slightly curved with the radius curvature the order few light years the time derivative the changing momentum the object what label gravitational electromagnetic forces electromagnetic force the electrostatic force was first described coulomb force which existed intrinsically between two charges the properties the electrostatic force were that varied inverse square law directed the radial direction was both attractive and repulsive there was intrinsic polarity was independent the mass the charged and followed the superposition principle coulomb law unifies all these observations into one succinct subsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct the electric field useful for determining the electrostatic force electric charge any point the electric field was based using hypothetical test charge anywhere space and then using law determine the electrostatic thus the electric field anywhere space defined where the magnitude the hypothetical test meanwhile the lorentz force magnetism was discovered exist between two electric currents has the same mathematical character law with the proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents similar the electric the magnetic field can used determine the magnetic force electric current any point this the magnitude the magnetic field was determined where the magnitude the hypothetical test current and the length hypothetical wire through which the test current the magnetic field exerts force all magnets including for those used compasses the fact that the earth magnetic field aligned closely with the orientation the axis causes compass magnets become oriented because the magnetic force pulling the through combining the definition electric current the time rate change electric rule vector multiplication called lorentz law describes the force charge moving magnetic the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description unified electromagnetic force that acts this force can written sum the electrostatic force due the electric and the magnetic force due the magnetic fully this the where the electromagnetic the magnitude the charge the the electric the velocity the particle which crossed with the magnetic field the origin electric and magnetic fields would not fully explained until when james clerk maxwell unified number earlier theories into set scalar which were later reformulated into vector equations oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs these maxwell equations fully described the sources the fields being stationary and moving and the interactions the fields this led maxwell discover that electric and magnetic fields could through wave that traveled speed which calculated the speed light this insight united the nascent fields electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly complete description the electromagnetic spectrum however attempting reconcile electromagnetic theory with two the photoelectric effect and the nonexistence the ultraviolet catastrophe proved through the work leading theoretical new theory electromagnetism was developed using quantum this final modification electromagnetic theory ultimately led quantum electrodynamics which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena being mediated particles known photons photons are the fundamental exchange particle which described all interactions relating electromagnetism including the electromagnetic note common misconception ascribe the stiffness and rigidity solid matter the repulsion like charges under the influence the electromagnetic however these characteristics actually result from the pauli exclusion citation needed since electrons are fermions they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state other when the electrons material are densely packed there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them some them must higher energy this means that takes energy pack them while this effect manifested macroscopically structural technically only the result the existence finite set electron nuclear forces nuclear force strong interaction weak interaction there are two nuclear which today are usually described interactions that take place quantum theories particle the strong nuclear force the force responsible for the structural integrity atomic nuclei while the weak nuclear force responsible for the decay certain nucleons into leptons and other types hadrons the strong force today understood represent the interactions between quarks and gluons detailed the theory quantum chromodynamics the strong force the fundamental force mediated gluons acting upon antiquarks and the gluons themselves the aptly strong interaction the strongest the four fundamental the strong force only acts directly upon elementary however residual the force observed between hadrons the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons atomic the nuclear force here the strong force acts transmitted gluons which form part the virtual and rho mesons which classically transmit the nuclear force see this topic for the failure many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly this phenomenon called color confinement the weak force due the exchange the heavy and bosons its most familiar effect beta decay neutrons atomic and the associated radioactivity the word weak derives from the fact that the field strength some times less than that the strong force still stronger than gravity over short consistent electroweak theory has also been developed which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable temperatures excess approximately kelvins such temperatures have been probed modern particle accelerators and show the conditions the universe the early moments the big bang non fundamental forces some forces are consequences the fundamental such idealized models can utilized gain physical normal force normal

applied object parallel surface contact the limit specified the coefficient static friction multiplied the normal force other words the magnitude the static friction force satisfies the the kinetic friction force independent both the forces applied and the movement the thus the magnitude the force where the coefficient kinetic friction for most surface the coefficient kinetic friction less than the coefficient static tension tension tension forces can modeled using ideal strings which are frictionless unbreakable and they can combined with ideal pulleys which allow ideal strings switch physical ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously reaction pairs that two objects are connected ideal any force directed along the string the first object accompanied force directed along the string the opposite direction the second connecting the same string multiple times the same object through the use that uses movable the tension force load can for every string that acts another

that act normal the sectional area the matrix diagonals the well shear terms associated with forces that act parallel the sectional area the diagonal the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains including also tensile stresses and compressions fictitious forces fictitious forces there are forces which are frame dependent meaning that they appear due the adoption newtonian that non inertial reference frames such forces include the centrifugal force and the coriolis force these forces are considered fictitious because they not exist frames reference that are not general relativity gravity becomes fictitious force that arises situations where spacetime deviates from flat kaluza klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively the curvature differently scaled which would ultimately imply that all forces are rotations and torque momentum torque forces that cause extended objects rotate are associated with torques mathematically the torque force defined relative arbitrary reference point the cross product where position vector torque the rotation equivalent force the same way that angle the rotational equivalent for position angular velocity for velocity and angular momentum for momentum consequence first law there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon unbalanced likewise newton second law motion can used derive analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration the rigid where moment inertia this provides definition for the moment inertia which the rotational equivalent for more advanced treatments where the rotation over time interval the moment inertia must substituted the tensor that when properly fully determines the characteristics rotations including precession and nutation equivalently the differential form second law provides alternative definition newton third law motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite and therefore also directly implies the conservation angular momentum for closed systems that experience rotations and revolutions through the action internal centripetal force centripetal force for object accelerating circular the unbalanced force acting the object where the mass the the velocity the object and the distance the center the circular path and the unit vector pointing the radial direction outwards from the this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt any object always directed toward the center the curving such forces act perpendicular the velocity vector associated with the motion and therefore not change the speed the object magnitude the but only the direction the velocity the unbalanced force that accelerates object can resolved into component that perpendicular the and one that tangential the this yields both the tangential force which accelerates the object either slowing down speeding and the radial force which changes its kinematic integrals impulse mechanical work power forces can used define number physical concepts integrating with respect kinematic variables for integrating with respect time gives the definition impulse which second must equivalent the change momentum yielding the impulse momentum theorem similarly integrating with respect position gives definition for the work done which equivalent changes kinetic energy yielding the work energy theorem power the rate change the work the trajectory extended position change time interval with the velocity potential energy potential energy instead often the mathematically related concept potential energy field can used for for the gravitational force acting upon object can seen the action the

produced every forces can classified conservative conservative forces are equivalent the gradient potential while nonconservative forces are conservative forces conservative force conservative force that acts closed system has associated mechanical work that allows energy convert only between kinetic potential forms this means that for closed the net mechanical energy conserved whenever conservative force acts the the therefore related directly the difference potential energy between two different locations and can considered artifact the potential field the same way that the direction and amount flow water can considered artifact the contour map the elevation conservative forces include gravity the electromagnetic force and the spring force each these forces has models which are dependent position often given radial vector emanating from spherically symmetric potentials examples this for where the gravitational constant and the mass object for electrostatic where electric permittivity free space and the electric charge object for spring where the spring constant nonconservative forces for certain physical impossible model forces being due gradient this often due macrophysical considerations which yield forces arising from macroscopic statistical average microstates for friction caused the gradients numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms but manifests force model which independent any macroscale position nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces tension compression and drag however for any sufficiently detailed all these forces are the results conservative ones since each these macroscopic forces are the net results the gradients microscopic the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces described detailed treatment with statistical mechanics macroscopic closed nonconservative forces act change the internal energies the and are often associated with
