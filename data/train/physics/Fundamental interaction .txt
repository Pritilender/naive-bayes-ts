using calculational approximation although such perturbation theory inadequate model some experimental observations for instance bound states and solitons still physicists widely accept the standard model most experimentally confirmed beyond the standard model some theorists work unite the electroweak and strong interactions within grand unified theory some attempts guts hypothesize shadow particles such that every known matter particle associates with undiscovered force particle and vice altogether supersymmetry other theorists seek quantize the gravitational field modeling behavior its hypothetical force the graviton and achieve quantum gravity one approach loop quantum gravity still other theorists seek both and gut within one reducing all four fundamental interactions theory everything the most prevalent aim toe string theory although model matter particles added susy force particles and strictly became superstring multiple seemingly disparate superstring theories were unified theory theories beyond the standard model remain highly lacking great experimental overview the fundamental interaction the conceptual model fundamental matter consists fermions which carry properties called charges and spin intrinsic angular momentum where the reduced planck constant they attract repel each other exchanging bosons the interaction any pair fermions perturbation theory can then modeled interaction the exchange bosons always carries energy and momentum between the thereby changing their speed and the exchange may also transport charge between the changing the charges the fermions the process turn them from one type fermion since bosons carry one unit angular the spin direction will flip from vice during such exchange units the reduced constant because interaction results fermions attracting and repelling each older term for interaction force according the present there are four fundamental interactions gravitation electromagnetism the weak interaction and the strong interaction their magnitude and behavior vary described the table modern physics attempts explain every observed physical phenomenon these fundamental moreover reducing the number different interaction types seen two cases point are the unification electric and magnetic force into the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction into the electroweak interaction see both magnitude relative and range given the are meaningful only within rather complex theoretical should also noted that the table below lists properties conceptual scheme that still the subject ongoing strong quantum chromodynamics gluons see discussion below electromagnetic quantum electrodynamics photons weak electroweak theory and bosons gravitation general relativity gravitons the modern quantum mechanical view the fundamental forces other than gravity that particles matter fermions not directly interact with each but rather carry and exchange virtual particles gauge bosons which are the interaction carriers force for photons mediate the interaction electric charges and gluons mediate the interaction color charges the interactions gravitation gravitation gravitation far the weakest the four the weakness gravity can easily demonstrated suspending pin using simple magnet such refrigerator the magnet able hold the pin against the gravitational pull the entire yet gravitation very important for macroscopic objects and over macroscopic distances for the following gravitation the only interaction that acts all particles having has infinite like electromagnetism but unlike strong and weak cannot transformed shielded always attracts and never even though electromagnetism far stronger than electrostatic attraction not relevant for large celestial such stars and simply because such bodies contain equal numbers protons and electrons and have net electric charge nothing cancels gravity since only unlike electric forces which can attractive the other all objects having mass are subject the gravitational which only therefore only gravitation matters the large scale structure the the long range gravitation makes responsible for such scale phenomena the structure black holes and the expansion the universe gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena more modest such planetary orbits well everyday objects heavy objects act they were glued the and animals can only jump gravitation was the first interaction described ancient aristotle hypothesized that objects different masses fall different during the scientific revolution galileo galilei experimentally determined that this was not the case neglecting the friction due air and buoyancy forces atmosphere present the case dropped air filled balloon water filled all objects accelerate toward the earth the same isaac newton law universal gravitation was good approximation the behaviour our day understanding gravitation stems from albert einstein general theory relativity more accurate especially for cosmological masses and description gravitation terms the geometry space time merging general relativity and quantum mechanics quantum field theory into more general theory quantum gravity area active hypothesized that gravitation mediated massless particle called the graviton although general relativity has been experimentally confirmed the weak field post newtonian case all but the smallest there are rival theories those taken seriously the physics community all reduce general relativity some and the focus observational work establish limitations what deviations from general relativity are electroweak interaction electroweak interaction electromagnetism and weak interaction appear very different everyday low they can modeled using two different however above unification the order gev they would merge into single electroweak electroweak theory very important for modern cosmology particularly how the universe evolved this because shortly after the big bang the temperature was approximately above electromagnetic force and weak force were merged into combined electroweak for contributions the unification the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles abdus salam sheldon glashow and steven weinberg were awarded the nobel prize physics electromagnetism electromagnetism electromagnetism the force that acts between electrically charged particles this phenomenon includes the electrostatic force acting between charged particles and the combined effect electric and magnetic forces acting between charged particles moving relative each electromagnetism ranged like but vastly and therefore describes number macroscopic phenomena everyday experience such friction rainbows lightning and all made devices using electric current such lasers and computers electromagnetism fundamentally determines all and many atomic properties the chemical elements including all chemical bonding four kilogram gallon jug water there are total electron thus place two such jugs meter the electrons one the jugs repel those the other jug with force this larger than what the planet earth would weigh weighed another the atomic nuclei one jug also repel those the other with the same however these repulsive forces are cancelled the attraction the electrons jug with the nuclei jug and the attraction the nuclei jug with the electrons jug resulting net electromagnetic forces are tremendously stronger than gravity but cancel out that for large bodies gravity electrical and magnetic phenomena have been observed since ancient but was only the century that was discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects the same fundamental maxwell equations had rigorously quantified this unified maxwell restated using vector calculus the classical theory suitable for most technological the constant speed light vacuum customarily described with the letter can derived from which are consistent with the theory special einstein theory special relativity however which flows from the observation that the speed light constant matter how fast the observer showed that the theoretical result implied equations has profound implications far beyond magnetism the very nature time and other work that departed from classical einstein also explained the photoelectric effect hypothesizing that light was transmitted quanta which now call photons starting around paul dirac combined quantum mechanics with the relativistic theory electromagnetism further work the richard feynman freeman dyson julian schwinger and sin itiro tomonaga completed this which now called quantum electrodynamics the revised theory quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics provide theoretical basis for electromagnetic behavior such quantum tunneling which certain percentage electrically charged particles move ways that would impossible under classical electromagnetic that necessary for everyday electronic devices such transistors weak interaction weak interaction the weak interaction weak nuclear force responsible for some nuclear phenomena such beta decay electromagnetism and the weak force are now understood two aspects unified electroweak interaction this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known the standard model the theory the electroweak the carriers the weak force are the massive gauge bosons called the and bosons the weak interaction the only known interaction which does not conserve parity right the weak interaction even violates symmetry but does conserve cpt strong interaction strong interaction the strong interaction strong nuclear force the most complicated mainly because the way varies with distances greater than femtometers the strong force practically moreover holds only inside the atomic nucleus after the nucleus was discovered was clear that new force was needed overcome the electrostatic repulsion manifestation the positively charged protons otherwise the nucleus could not moreover the force had strong enough squeeze the protons into volume that that the entire from the short range this hideki yukawa predicted that was associated with massive whose mass approximately mev the discovery the pion ushered the modern era particle hundreds hadrons were discovered from the and extremely complicated theory hadrons strongly interacting particles was most the pions were understood oscillations vacuum condensates jun john sakurai proposed the rho and omega vector bosons force carrying particles for approximate symmetries isospin and hypercharge geoffrey chew edward burdett and steven frautschi grouped the heavier hadrons into families that could understood vibrational and rotational excitations strings while each these approaches offered deep approach led directly fundamental murray mann along with george zweig first proposed fractionally charged quarks throughout the different authors considered theories similar the modern fundamental theory quantum chromodynamics simple models for the interactions quarks the first hypothesize the gluons qcd were moo young han and yoichiro nambu who introduced the quark color charge and hypothesized that might associated with carrying that however was difficult see how such model could permanently confine han and nambu also assigned each quark color integer electrical that the quarks were fractionally charged only and they did not expect the quarks their model permanently murray mann and harald fritzsch proposed that the nambu color gauge field was the correct theory the distance interactions fractionally charged little david gross frank wilczek and david politzer discovered that this theory had the property asymptotic freedom allowing them make contact with experimental evidence they concluded that qcd was the complete theory the strong correct all distance the discovery asymptotic freedom led most physicists accept since became clear that even the distance properties the strong interactions could consistent with the quarks are permanently assuming that quarks are mikhail shifman arkady vainshtein and valentine zakharov were able compute the properties many lying hadrons directly from with only few extra parameters describe the kenneth wilson published computer calculations based the first principles establishing level confidence tantamount that qcd will confine since qcd has been the established theory the strong qcd theory fractionally charged quarks interacting means photon like particles called the gluons interact with each not just with the and long distances the lines force collimate into this the mathematical theory qcd not only explains how quarks interact over short but also the like discovered chew and which they manifest over longer beyond the standard model physics beyond the standard model numerous theoretical efforts have been made systematize the existing four fundamental interactions the model weak grand unified theories are proposals show that all the fundamental other than arise from single interaction with symmetries that break down low energy guts predict relationships among constants nature that are unrelated the guts also predict gauge coupling unification for the relative strengths the weak and strong prediction verified the lep for supersymmetric theories theories which integrate guts with quantum gravity theory face greater because quantum gravity which include string theory loop quantum gravity and twistor theory have secured wide some theories look for graviton complete the standard model list force carrying while like loop quantum emphasize the possibility that space itself may have quantum aspect some theories beyond the standard model include hypothetical fifth force and the search for such force ongoing line experimental research supersymmetric theories there are particles that acquire their masses only through supersymmetry breaking effects and these known moduli can mediate new another reason look for new forces the recent discovery that the expansion the universe accelerating also known dark energy giving rise need explain nonzero cosmological constant and possibly other modifications general relativity fifth forces have also been suggested explain phenomena such violations dark matter and dark flow see also physics portal standard model strong interaction electroweak
