important but poorly understood the word galaxy derived from the greek galaxias literally milky reference the milky way examples galaxies range from dwarfs with few ten million stars giants with one hundred trillion stars each orbiting their own center mass galaxies contain varying numbers planets star systems star clusters and types interstellar clouds between these objects sparse interstellar medium dust and cosmic rays supermassive black holes reside the center most they are thought the primary driver active galactic nuclei found the core some the milky way galaxy known harbor least one such galaxies have been historically categorized according their apparent usually referred their visual common form the elliptical galaxy which has ellipse shaped light spiral galaxies are shaped with curving those with irregular unusual shapes are known irregular galaxies and typically originate from disruption the gravitational pull neighboring such interactions between nearby which may ultimately result sometimes induce significantly increased incidents star formation leading starburst galaxies there are probably more than billion galaxies the observable universe most are parsecs diameter and usually separated distances the order millions parsecs intergalactic space the space between filled with tenuous gas average density less than one atom per cubic the majority galaxies are organized into neither fully random nor fully deterministic set associations known galaxy groups and clusters which turn usually form larger superclusters the largest scale these associations are

kyklos circle galaktikos milky for its appearance lighter colored band the greek mythology zeus places his son born mortal the infant heracles hera breast while she asleep that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become hera wakes while breastfeeding and then realizes she nursing unknown she pushes the baby away and jet her milk sprays the night producing the faint band light known the milky the astronomical the capitalized word used refer our the milky way distinguish from the billions other the english term milky way can traced back story chaucer see the which men clepeth the milky for hit the house fame when william herschel constructed his catalog deep sky objects used the name spiral nebula for certain objects such these would later recognized immense conglomerations when the true distance these objects began and they would termed island however the word universe was understood mean the entirety this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known nomenclature hubble deep field ultraviolet infrared fornax galaxies big bang tens thousands these galaxies have now been only few have been given established such the andromeda galaxy the magellanic clouds the whirlpool galaxy and the sombrero galaxy astronomers work with numbers from certain such the messier catalogue the ngc new general catalogue the index catalogue the catalogue galaxies and clusters galaxies the mcg morphological catalogue galaxies and ugc uppsala general catalogue galaxies all the known galaxies appear one more these catalogues but each time under different for the messier spiral system which has the number the catalogue messier also codes ugc cgcg mcg and pgc hubble abell because customary science assign names most the studied even the smallest the belgian astrophysicist gerard bodifee and the classicist michel berger started new catalogue cng catalogue named galaxies which thousand known galaxies are given descriptive names latin latinized accordance with the binomial nomenclature that one uses other sciences such anatomy paleontology and other fields astronomy such the geography one the arguments that these impressive objects deserve better than uninspired for instance bodifee and berger propose the descriptive name callimorphus ursae for the formed barred galaxy messier ursa observation history the realization that live and that there many other parallels discoveries that were made about the milky way and other nebulae the night milky way milky way galactic center the greek philosopher democritus proposed that the bright band the night sky known the milky way might consist distant aristotle however believed the milky way caused the ignition the fiery exhalation some stars that were numerous and close and that the ignition takes place the upper part the atmosphere the region the world that continuous with the heavenly motions the neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus the younger was scientifically critical this arguing that the milky way were sublunary situated between earth and the should appear different different times and places and that should have parallax which does his the milky way was this idea would influential later the islamic world milky way alma according mohani the arabian astronomer alhazen made the first attempt observing and measuring the milky and thus determined that because the milky way had was very remote from the earth and did not belong the the persian astronomer proposed the milky way galaxy collection countless fragments the nature nebulous the andalusian astronomer ibn bajjah avempace proposed that the milky way was made many stars that almost touch one another and appear continuous image due the effect refraction from sublunary citing his observation the conjunction jupiter and mars evidence this occurring when two objects are the the born ibn qayyim proposed the milky way galaxy myriad tiny stars packed together the sphere the fixed actual proof the milky way consisting many stars came when the italian astronomer galileo galilei used telescope study the milky way and discovered that composed huge number faint the english astronomer thomas wright his original theory new hypothesis the universe speculated that the galaxy might rotating body huge number stars held together gravitational forces akin the solar system but much larger the resulting disk stars can seen band the sky from our perspective inside the treatise immanuel kant elaborated idea about the structure the milky the first attempt describe the shape the milky way and the position the sun was carried out william herschel carefully counting the number stars different regions the produced diagram the shape the galaxy with the solar system close the center using refined kapteyn arrived the picture small diameter about ellipsoid galaxy with the sun close the different method harlow shapley based the cataloguing globular clusters led radically different flat disk with diameter approximately kiloparsecs and the sun far from the both analyses failed take into account the absorption light interstellar dust present the galactic plane but after robert julius trumpler quantified this effect studying open clusters the present picture our host the milky emerged distinction from other nebulae the the persian astronomer sufi made the earliest recorded observation the andromeda galaxy describing small who published his findings his book fixed stars also identified the large magellanic cloud which visible from yemen though not from isfahan was not seen europeans until magellan voyage the the andromeda galaxy was independently rediscovered simon marius these are the only galaxies outside the milky way that are easily visible the unaided they were the first galaxies observed from thomas wright his original theory new hypothesis the universe speculated that the milky way was flattened disk and that some the nebulae visible the night sky might separate milky immanuel kant used the term island describe these distant andromeda galaxy toward the end the charles messier compiled catalog containing the brightest nebulae celestial objects with nebulous later followed larger catalog nebulae assembled william lord rosse constructed new telescope and was able distinguish between elliptical and spiral also managed make out individual point sources some these lending credence earlier vesto slipher made spectrographic studies the brightest spiral nebulae determine they were made from chemicals that would expected planetary however slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae had high red indicating that they were moving away rate higher than the milky escape velocity thus they were not gravitationally bound the milky and were unlikely part the messier lord rosse heber curtis had observed nova andromedae within the great andromeda nebula the andromeda messier object was searching the photographic found more novae curtis noticed that these novae magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within our result was able come with distance estimate parsecs became proponent the called island hypothesis which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent the called great debate took place between harlow shapley and heber curtis concerning the nature the milky spiral and the dimensions the support his claim that the great andromeda nebula was external curtis noted the appearance dark lanes resembling the dust clouds the milky well the significant doppler shift the matter was conclusively settled the early the estonian astronomer ernst pik gave distance determination that supported the theory that the andromeda nebula indeed distant galactic using the new inch wilson telescope edwin hubble was able resolve the outer parts some spiral nebulae collections individual stars and identified some cepheid variables thus allowing him estimate the distance the they were far too distant part the milky hubble produced classification system for galaxies that used this the hubble sequence modern research rotation curve hendrik van hulst predicted microwave radiation wavelength resulting from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas this radiation was observed the radiation allowed for much improved study the milky way since not affected dust absorption and its doppler shift can used map the motion the gas the these observations led the postulation rotating bar structure the center the with improved radio telescopes hydrogen gas could also traced other udfy the was discovered vera rubin study the rotation speed gas galaxies that the total visible mass from the stars and does not properly account for the speed the rotating this galaxy rotation problem thought explained the presence large quantities unseen dark matter beginning the the hubble space telescope yielded improved among other established that the missing dark matter our galaxy cannot solely consist inherently faint and small the hubble deep field extremely long exposure relatively empty part the provided evidence that there are about billion galaxies the improved technology detecting the spectra invisible humans radio infrared and ray telescopes allow detection other galaxies that are not detected particularly galaxy surveys the zone avoidance the region the sky blocked the milky have revealed number new types and morphology galaxy morphological classification note galaxies come three main ellipticals spirals and slightly more extensive description galaxy types based their appearance given the hubble sequence since the hubble sequence entirely based upon visual morphological may miss certain important characteristics galaxies such star formation rate starburst and activity the core active galaxies ellipticals elliptical galaxy the hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies the basis their ranging from being nearly which highly these galaxies have ellipsoidal profile giving them elliptical appearance regardless the viewing their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter consequently these galaxies also have low portion open clusters and reduced rate new star instead they are dominated generally more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center gravity random the stars contain low abundances heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial this sense they have some similarity the much smaller globular clusters the largest galaxies are giant many elliptical galaxies are believed form due the interaction galaxies resulting collision and they can grow enormous sizes compared spiral for and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near the core large galaxy starburst galaxies are the result such galactic collision that can result the formation elliptical spirals spiral galaxy barred spiral galaxy whirlpool galaxy spiral galaxies are galaxies whose visible stars take spiraling pinwheel though the stars and other visible material contained such galaxy lie mostly the majority mass spiral galaxies exists roughly spherical halo dark matter that extends beyond the visible spiral galaxies consist rotating disk stars and interstellar along with central bulge generally older extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright the hubble classification spiral galaxies are listed type followed letter that indicates the degree tightness the spiral arms and the size the central galaxy has tightly poorly defined arms and possesses relatively large core the other galaxy has well defined arms and small core galaxy with poorly defined arms sometimes referred flocculent spiral galaxy contrast the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and defined spiral appears the reason that some spiral galaxies are fat and bulging while some are flat discs because how fast they ngc spiral the spiral arms have the shape approximate logarithmic spirals pattern that can theoretically shown result from disturbance uniformly rotating mass like the the spiral arms rotate around the but they with constant angular velocity the spiral arms are thought areas density density waves stars move through the space velocity each stellar system modified the gravitational force the higher the velocity returns normal after the stars depart the other side the this effect akin wave slowdowns moving along highway full moving the arms are visible because the high density facilitates star and therefore they harbor many bright and young hoag object ring galaxy ngc lenticular galaxy majority spiral including our own milky way galaxy have bar shaped band stars that extends outward either side the then merges into the spiral arm the hubble classification these are designated followed case letter that indicates the form the spiral arms the same manner the categorization normal spiral bars are thought temporary structures that can occur result density wave radiating outward from the else due tidal interaction with another many barred spiral galaxies are possibly result gas being channeled into the core along the our own the milky way large shaped spiral galaxy about kiloparsecs diameter and kiloparsec contains about two hundred billion stars and has total mass about six hundred billion times the mass the other morphologies peculiar galaxies are galactic formations that develop unusual properties due tidal interactions with other example this the ring galaxy which possesses like structure stars and interstellar medium surrounding bare ring galaxy thought occur when smaller galaxy passes through the core spiral such event may have affected the andromeda galaxy displays like structure when viewed infrared radiation lenticular galaxy intermediate form that has properties both elliptical and spiral these are categorized hubble type and they possess defined spiral arms with elliptical halo barred lenticular galaxies receive hubble classification addition the classifications mentioned there are number galaxies that can not readily classified into elliptical spiral these are categorized irregular galaxy has some structure but does not align cleanly with the hubble classification irr galaxies not possess any structure that resembles hubble and may have been nearby examples irregular galaxies include the magellanic clouds dwarfs dwarf galaxy despite the prominence large elliptical and spiral most galaxies the universe appear dwarf these galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic being about one hundredth the size the milky containing only few billion ultra compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only parsecs many dwarf galaxies may orbit single larger the milky way has least dozen such with estimated yet dwarf galaxies may also classified elliptical spiral irregular since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance large they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead study milky way neighbors found that all dwarf the central mass approximately million solar masses regardless whether the galaxy has thousands millions this has led the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed dark matter and that the minimum size may indicate form warm dark matter incapable gravitational coalescence smaller unusual dynamics and activities interacting interacting galaxy antennae galaxies interactions between these galaxies are relatively and play important role their evolution near misses between galaxies result warping distortions due tidal interactions and may cause some exchange gas and collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not the stars within these interacting galaxies will typically pass straight through without however the gas and dust within the two forms will this can trigger bursts star formation the interstellar medium becomes disrupted and collision can severely distort the shape one both forming rings like the extreme interactions are galactic this case the relative momentum the two galaxies insufficient allow the galaxies pass through each instead they gradually merge form larger mergers can result significant changes compared the original the case where one the galaxies much more however the result known cannibalism this case the larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed the while the smaller galaxy torn the milky way galaxy currently the process cannibalizing the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy and the canis major dwarf galaxy starburst starburst galaxy stars are created within galaxies from reserve cold gas that forms into giant molecular clouds some galaxies have been observed form stars exceptional known should they continue however they would consume their reserve gas time frame lower than the lifespan the hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million relatively brief period the history starburst galaxies were more common during the early history the and still contribute estimated the total star production starburst galaxies are characterized dusty concentrations gas and the appearance newly formed including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds create regions these massive stars produce supernova explosions resulting expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding these outbursts trigger chain reaction star building that spreads throughout the gaseous only when the available gas nearly consumed dispersed does the starburst activity come starbursts are often associated with merging interacting the prototype example such forming interaction which experienced close encounter with the larger irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots starburst active nucleus active galactic nucleus portion the galaxies can observe are classified that significant portion the total energy output from the galaxy emitted source other than the dust and interstellar medium the standard model for active galactic nucleus based upon accretion disc that forms around supermassive black hole the core the radiation from active galactic nucleus results from the gravitational energy matter falls toward the black hole from the about these diametrically opposed pair energetic jets ejects particles from the core velocities close the speed light the mechanism for producing these jets still not well active galaxies that emit energy radiation the form rays are classified seyfert galaxies quasars depending the blazars are believed active galaxy with relativistic jet that pointed the direction radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic unified model these types active galaxies explains their differences based the viewing angle the possibly related active galactic nuclei well starburst regions are low ionization nuclear line regions the emission from type galaxies dominated weakly ionized elements approximately third nearby galaxies are classified containing liner formation and evolution galaxy formation and evolution the study galactic formation and evolution attempts answer questions regarding how galaxies formed and their evolutionary path over the history the some theories this field have now become widely but still active area astrophysics formation current cosmological models the early universe are based the big bang theory about years after this atoms hydrogen and helium began event called recombination nearly all the hydrogen was neutral and readily absorbed and stars had yet result this period has been called the dark ages was from density fluctuations anisotropic irregularities this primordial matter that larger structures began masses baryonic matter started condense within cold dark matter halos these primordial structures would eventually become the galaxies see evidence for the early appearance galaxies was found when was discovered that the galaxy iok has unusually high redshift corresponding just million years after the big bang and making the most distant and primordial galaxy yet while some scientists have claimed other objects such abell have higher redshifts and therefore are seen earlier stage the iok age and composition have been more reliably however december astronomers reported that the udfj galaxy the most distant galaxy known and has redshift value the estimated have existed around million after the big bang which was about billion years about billion light years the existence such early protogalaxies suggests that they must have grown the called dark the detailed process which such early galaxy formation occurred major open question theories could divided into two top down and down theories such the sandage model protogalaxies form scale simultaneous collapse lasting about one hundred million theories such the zinn model small structures such globular clusters form and then number such bodies accrete form larger once protogalaxies began form and the first halo stars called population iii stars appeared within these were composed almost entirely hydrogen and and may have been these huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply fuel and became supernovae releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium this first generation stars ionized the surrounding neutral creating expanding bubbles space through which light could readily evolution within billion years key structures begin globular clusters the central supermassive black and galactic bulge poor population stars form the creation supermassive black hole appears play key role actively regulating the growth galaxies limiting the total amount additional matter during this early galaxies undergo major burst star during the following two billion the accumulated matter settles into galactic disc galaxy will continue absorb infalling material from high velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its this matter mostly hydrogen and the cycle stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance heavy eventually allowing the formation planets hubble extreme deep field xdf moon stars xdf observable universe xdf protogalaxies young stars the evolution galaxies can significantly affected interactions and mergers galaxies were common during the early and the majority galaxies were peculiar given the distances between the the great majority stellar systems colliding galaxies will however gravitational stripping the interstellar gas and dust that makes the spiral arms produces long train stars known tidal examples these formations can seen ngc the antennae galaxies example such the milky way galaxy and the nearby andromeda galaxy are moving toward each other about and depending upon the lateral the two may collide about five six billion although the milky way has never collided with galaxy large andromeda evidence past collisions the milky way with smaller dwarf galaxies such scale interactions are time mergers two systems equal size become less most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion and the net rate star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years future trends most star formation occurs smaller galaxies where cool gas not spiral like the milky only produce new generations stars long they have dense molecular clouds interstellar hydrogen their spiral elliptical galaxies are already largely devoid this and form new the supply forming material once stars have converted the available supply hydrogen into heavier new star formation will come the current era star formation expected continue for one hundred billion and then the stellar will wind down after about ten trillion one hundred trillion years the longest lived stars our tiny red dwarfs begin the end the stellar galaxies will composed compact objects brown dwarfs white dwarfs that are cooling cold black dwarfs neutron stars and black holes eventually result gravitational relaxation all stars will either fall into central supermassive black holes flung into intergalactic space result larger scale structures observable universe large scale structure galaxy filament galaxy groups and clusters deep sky surveys show that galaxies are often found relatively close association with other solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with another galaxy comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively only about the galaxies surveyed have been found truly however these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies the and may still orbited satellite isolated galaxies note can produce stars higher rate than their gas not being stripped other nearby the largest the universe continually resulting average increase the separation between individual galaxies see hubble law associations galaxies can overcome this expansion local scale through their mutual gravitational these associations formed early the clumps dark matter pulled their respective galaxies nearby groups later merged form scale this going merger process well influx infalling heats the galactic gas within cluster very high reaching megakelvins about the mass cluster the form dark with consisting this heated gas and the remaining few percent the matter the form seyfert sextet most galaxies the universe are gravitationally bound number other these form fractal like hierarchy clustered with the smallest such associations being termed group galaxies the most common type galactic and these formations contain majority the galaxies well most the baryonic mass the remain gravitationally bound such each member galaxy must have sufficiently low velocity prevent from escaping see virial theorem there insufficient kinetic energy however the group may evolve into smaller number galaxies through larger structures containing many thousands galaxies packed into area few megaparsecs across are called clusters galaxies are often dominated single giant elliptical known the brightest cluster galaxy which over tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass its superclusters contain tens thousands which are found groups and sometimes the supercluster scale galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty above this the universe appears the same all directions isotropic and homogeneous the milky way galaxy member association named the local group relatively small group galaxies that has diameter approximately the milky way and the andromeda galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the many the other member galaxies are dwarf companions these two the local group itself part like structure within the virgo supercluster extended structure groups and clusters galaxies centered the virgo cluster and the virgo supercluster itself part the pisces cetus supercluster complex giant galaxy filament multi wavelength observation observational astronomy after galaxies external the milky way were found initial observations were made mostly using visible light the peak radiation most stars lies the observation the stars that form galaxies has been major component optical astronomy also favorable portion the spectrum for observing ionized regions and for examining the distribution dusty the dust present the interstellar medium opaque visual more transparent far infrared which can used observe the interior regions giant molecular clouds and galactic cores great infrared also used observe red shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier the history the water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb number useful portions the infrared altitude based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy the first visual study particularly active was made using radio frequencies the atmosphere nearly transparent radio between mhz and the ionosphere blocks signals below this large radio interferometers have been used map the active jets emitted from active radio telescopes can also used observe neutral hydrogen via radiation including potentially the ionized matter the early universe that later collapsed form ultraviolet and ray telescopes can
