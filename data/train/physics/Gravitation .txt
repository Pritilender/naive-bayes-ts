modern work gravitational theory began with the work galileo galilei the late and early his famous though possibly apocryphal experiment dropping balls from the tower pisa and later with careful measurements balls rolling down inclines galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects the same this was major departure from aristotle belief that heavier objects accelerate galileo postulated air resistance the reason that lighter objects may fall slower galileo work set the stage for the formulation theory newton theory gravitation law universal gravitation sir isaac newton english mathematician sir isaac newton published principia which hypothesizes the inverse square law universal his own deduced that the forces which keep the planets their orbs must reciprocally the squares their distances from the centers about which they and thereby compared the force requisite keep the moon her orb with the force gravity the surface the and found them answer pretty newton theory enjoyed its greatest success when was used predict the existence neptune based motions uranus that could not accounted for the actions the other calculations both john couch adams and urbain verrier predicted the general position the and calculations are what led johann gottfried galle the discovery discrepancy mercury orbit pointed out flaws the end the was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not accounted for entirely under but all searches for another perturbing body such planet orbiting the sun even closer than had been the issue was resolved albert einstein new theory general relativity which accounted for the small discrepancy although theory has been most modern non relativistic gravitational calculations are still made using theory because much simpler theory work with than general and gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small speeds and equivalence principle the equivalence principle explored succession researchers including lor and expresses the idea that all objects fall the same the simplest way test the weak equivalence principle drop two objects different masses compositions vacuum and see whether they hit the ground the same such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall the same rate when friction including air more sophisticated tests use torsion balance type

general relativity general relativity the effects gravitation are ascribed spacetime curvature instead the starting point for general relativity the equivalence principle which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes falling inertial objects being accelerated relative inertial observers the newtonian physics however such acceleration can occur unless least one the objects being operated einstein proposed that spacetime curved and that falling objects are moving along locally straight paths curved these straight paths are called geodesics like first law einstein theory states that force applied would deviate from for are longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance the earth exerts upward force and are inertial the ground this explains why moving along the geodesics spacetime considered einstein discovered the field equations general which relate the presence matter and the curvature spacetime and are named after the einstein field equations are set simultaneous non linear differential equations the solutions the field equations are the components the metric tensor metric tensor describes geometry the geodesic paths for spacetime are calculated from the metric notable solutions the einstein field equations the schwarzschild solution which describes spacetime surrounding spherically symmetric non rotating uncharged massive for compact enough this solution generated black hole with central singularity for radial distances from the center which are much greater than the schwarzschild radius the accelerations predicted the schwarzschild solution are practically identical those predicted theory the reissner solution which the central object has electrical for charges with geometrized length which are less than the geometrized length the mass the this solution produces black holes with two event horizons the kerr solution for rotating massive this solution also produces black holes with multiple event the kerr newman solution for rotating massive this solution also produces black holes with multiple event the cosmological friedmann walker solution which predicts the expansion the universe the tests general relativity included the general relativity accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession mercury the prediction that time runs slower lower potentials has been confirmed the pound rebka experiment the hafele keating experiment and the gps the prediction the deflection light was first confirmed arthur stanley eddington from his observations during the solar eclipse may eddington measured starlight deflections twice those predicted newtonian corpuscular accordance with the predictions general however his interpretation the results was later more recent tests using radio interferometric measurements quasars passing behind the sun have more accurately and consistently confirmed the deflection light the degree predicted general see also gravitational lens the time delay light passing close massive object was first identified irwin shapiro interplanetary spacecraft gravitational radiation has been indirectly confirmed through studies binary pulsars alexander friedmann found that einstein equations have stationary solutions even the presence the cosmological constant georges tre showed that static solutions the einstein which are possible the presence the cosmological are and therefore the static universe envisioned einstein could not later einstein himself agreed with the results friedmann and thus general relativity predicted that the universe had had either expand the expansion the universe discovered edwin hubble confirmed this the prediction frame dragging was consistent with the recent gravity probe results general relativity predicts that light should lose its energy when travelling away from the massive the group radek wojtak the niels bohr institute the university copenhagen collected data from galaxy clusters and found that the light coming from the cluster centers tended shifted compared the cluster confirming the energy loss due gravity and quantum mechanics graviton quantum gravity the decades after the discovery general relativity was realized that general relativity incompatible with quantum mechanics possible describe gravity the framework quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces such that the attractive force gravity arises due exchange virtual gravitons the same way the electromagnetic force arises from exchange virtual photons this reproduces general relativity the classical limit however this approach fails short distances the order the planck length where more complete theory quantum gravity new approach quantum specifics gravity gravity every planetary body including the surrounded its own gravitational which exerts attractive force all assuming spherically symmetrical the strength this field any given point proportional the planetary mass and inversely proportional the square the distance from the center the the strength the gravitational field numerically equal the acceleration objects under its and its value the denoted expressed below the standard average according the bureau international poids international systems units the standard acceleration due gravity this means ignoring air object falling freely near the surface increases its velocity for each second its thus object starting from rest will attain velocity after one approximately after two and adding each resulting also again ignoring air any and all when dropped from the same will hit the ground the same according newton law the earth itself experiences force equal magnitude and opposite direction that which exerts falling this means that the earth also accelerates towards the object until they because the mass the earth however the acceleration imparted the earth this opposite force negligible comparison the the object bounce after has collided with the each them then exerts repulsive contact force the other which effectively balances the attractive force gravity and prevents further the force gravity earth the resultant vector two the gravitational attraction accordance with universal law and the centrifugal which results from the choice rotating frame the the force gravity the weakest due the centrifugal force caused the the force gravity varies with latitude and becomes stronger you increase latitude toward the the standard value the one originally adopted the international committee weights and measures for latitude even though has been shown too high about five parts ten this value has persisted meteorology and some standard atmospheres the value for latitude even though applies more precisely latitude equations for falling body near the surface the earth equations for falling body under assumption constant newton law universal gravitation simplifies where the mass the body and constant vector with average magnitude the acceleration due gravity equal this initially stationary object which allowed fall freely under gravity drops distance which proportional the square the elapsed the image the spanning half was captured with stroboscopic flash flashes per during the first second the ball drops one unit distance unit about has dropped total units units and under the same constant gravity the potential energy body height given mgh with meaning this expression valid only over small distances from the surface the similarly the expression for the maximum height reached vertically projected body with initial velocity useful for small heights and small initial velocities gravity and astronomy the discovery and application law gravity accounts for the detailed information have about the planets our solar the mass the the distance quasars and even the theory dark matter although have not traveled all the planets nor the know their these masses are obtained applying the laws gravity the measured characteristics the space object maintains its orbit because the force gravity acting upon planets orbit stars orbit galactic centers galaxies orbit center mass and clusters orbit superclusters the force gravity exerted one object another directly proportional the product those masses and inversely proportional the square the distance between gravitational radiation gravitational wave general gravitational radiation generated situations where the curvature spacetime such the case with orbiting the gravitational radiation emitted the solar system far too small however gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed energy loss over time binary pulsar systems such psr believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts gravitational gravitational radiation observatories such the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo have been created study the confirmed detections have been made this hypothetical speed gravity speed gravity december research team china announced that had produced measurements the phase lag earth tides during full and new moons which seem prove that the speed gravity equal the speed the findings were released the chinese science bulletin february anomalies and discrepancies there are some observations that are not adequately accounted which may point the need for better theories gravity perhaps explained other dark matter fast stars stars galaxies follow distribution velocities where stars the outskirts are moving faster than they should according the observed distributions normal galaxies within galaxy clusters show similar dark matter which would interact gravitationally but not would account for the various modifications newtonian dynamics have also been flyby anomaly various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during gravity assist maneuvers accelerating expansion the metric expansion space seems speeding dark energy has been proposed explain recent alternative explanation that the geometry space not homogeneous due clusters and that when the data are reinterpreted take this into the expansion not speeding after however this conclusion anomalous increase the astronomical unit recent measurements indicate that planetary orbits are widening faster than this were solely through the sun losing mass radiating extra energetic photons photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose again the way the accelerating expansion the universe should stop the photons returning all the but even taking this into account photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation gain twice much energy this may indicate that gravity falls off faster than squared certain distance extra massive hydrogen clouds the spectral lines the lyman alpha forest suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together certain scales than expected like dark flow may indicate that gravity falls off slower than squared certain distance alternative
