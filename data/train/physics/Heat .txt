quotations bibliography cited references further bibliography external links history physicist james clerk maxwell his classic theory heat was one many who began build the already established idea that heat has something with matter this was the same idea put forth benjamin thompson who said was only following the work many one recommended books was heat mode motion john tyndall maxwell outlined four stipulations for the definition something which may transferred from one body another according the second law thermodynamics measurable quantity and can treated cannot treated material substance because may transformed into something that not material mechanical work heat one the forms energy from empirically based ideas and from other empirical the notions internal energy and entropy can lead the recognition the first and second laws this was the way the historical pioneers transfers energy heat between two bodies referring partington hot body brought conducting contact with cold the temperature the hot body falls and that the cold body and said that quantity heat has passed from the hot body the cold referring maxwell the hotter body loses and the colder body receives heat means process occurring some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become maxwell writes that convection such not purely thermal convection general regarded transport internal energy however the convection enclosed and then may regarded intermediary that transfers energy heat between source and destination because transfers only energy and not matter from the source the destination practical operating devices that harness transfers energy heat accordance with the first law for closed energy transferred solely heat enters one body and leaves changing the internal energies transfer between energy work complementary way changing internal though not logically rigorous from the viewpoint strict physical common form words that expresses this say that heat and work are heat engine classical commonly considered model the heat engine consists four the working the hot the cold and the work cyclic process leaves the working body unchanged and envisaged being repeated indefinitely work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged and thus only one work reservoir but two thermal reservoirs are because transfer energy heat single cycle sees energy taken the working body from the hot reservoir and sent the two other the work reservoir and the cold the hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives the second law thermodynamics requires that cycle can occur which energy received the cold heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature heat pump another commonly considered model the heat pump again there are four the working the hot the cold and the work single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold and then energy taken heat the working body from the cold then the work reservoir does work the working adding more its internal making hotter than the hot the hot working body passes heat the hot but still remains hotter than the cold then allowing expand without doing work another body and without passing heat another the working body made colder than the cold can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir start another the device has transported energy from colder hotter but this not regarded being inanimate this because work supplied from the work not just simple thermodynamic but sequence thermodynamic operations which may regarded directed animate accordingly the cycle still accord with the second law the efficiency heat pump best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs macroscopic view quantity energy transferred heat according there are three main conceptual approaches one the microscopic kinetic theory also there are two macroscopic one the approach through the law conservation energy taken prior with mechanical analysis for example the work this mechanical view taken currently customary this the other macroscopic approach the thermodynamic which admits heat primitive which scientific induction knowledge the law conservation bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches the mechanical and the the thermodynamic view was taken the founders thermodynamics the nineteenth regards quantity energy transferred heat primitive concept coherent with primitive concept measured primarily calorimeter body the surroundings the with its own temperature and internal when connected the system path for heat changes measure heat the mechanical view was pioneered helmholtz and developed and used the twentieth largely through the influence max born regards quantity heat transferred heat derived defined for closed systems quantity heat transferred mechanisms other than work the latter being regarded primitive for defined macroscopic according the transfer internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer matter cannot reduced follows that there founded definition quantities energy transferred heat work associated with transfer nevertheless for the thermodynamical description equilibrium desired consider the effect temperature gradient established the surroundings across the system interest when there physical barrier wall between system and that when they are open with respect one the impossibility mechanical definition terms work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that temperature gradient causes diffusive flux internal process the thermodynamic might proposed candidate concept for transfer energy this may expected that there may also active other drivers diffusive flux internal such gradient chemical potential which drives transfer and gradient electric potential which drives electric current and such effects usually interact with diffusive flux internal energy driven temperature and such interactions are known effects that result diffusive transfer internal energy were also labeled heat they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down temperature never they would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer one and the same principle founded the idea heat conduction between closed one might try think narrowly heat flux driven purely temperature gradient conceptual component diffusive internal energy the thermodynamic the concept resting specifically careful calculations based detailed knowledge the processes and being indirectly these perchance happens that transfer matter and there are then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept one were dealing with closed but when there transfer the exact laws which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux internal rather than being exactly mostly need and many cases are practically consequently when there transfer the calculation the pure heat component the diffusive flux internal energy rests practically unverifiable quotations this reason think heat specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely closed and applicable only very restricted way open many writings this the term heat used when what meant therefore more accurately called diffusive flux internal such usage the term heat residue older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that body may have heat microscopic view heat the kinetic theory heat explained terms the microscopic motions and interactions constituent such atoms and heat transfer arises from temperature gradients through the diffuse exchange microscopic kinetic and potential particle particle collisions and other early and vague expression this was made francis bacon precise and detailed versions were developed the nineteenth statistical mechanics for closed system transfer heat the energy transfer associated with microscopic action the associated with jumps occupation numbers the energy levels the without change the values the energy levels possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work alter the occupation numbers without change the values the system energy levels but what distinguishes transfer heat that the transfer entirely due microscopic including radiative mathematical definition can formulated for small increments static adiabatic work terms the statistical distribution ensemble notation and units form energy heat has the unit joule the international system units however many applied fields engineering the british thermal unit and the calorie are often the standard unit for the rate heat transferred the watt defined joules per the total amount energy transferred heat conventionally written for algebraic heat released system into its surroundings convention negative quantity when system absorbs heat from its positive heat transfer heat flow per unit denoted this should not confused with time derivative function state which can also written with the dot since heat not function heat flux defined rate heat transfer per unit sectional resulting the unit watts per square metre estimation quantity heat quantity heat transferred can measured determined through calculations based other calorimetry the empirical basis the idea quantity heat transferred the transferred heat measured changes body known for temperature change volume phase such melting calculation quantity heat transferred can rely hypothetical quantity energy transferred adiabatic work and the first law thermodynamics such calculation the primary approach many theoretical studies quantity heat internal energy and enthalpy for closed system system from which matter can enter one version the first law thermodynamics states that the change internal energy the system equal the amount heat supplied the system minus the amount work done system its the foregoing sign convention for work used the present but alternate sign followed for consider the work performed the system its surroundings this the convention adopted many modern textbooks physical such those peter atkins and ira but many textbooks physics define work work done the this formula can written express definition quantity energy transferred based purely the concept adiabatic supposed that defined and measured solely processes adiabatic the work done the system includes boundary work when the system increases its volume against external such that exerted and other work shaft work performed compressor which called isochoric this section will neglect the isochoric work the internal state function cyclical such the operation heat state functions the working substance return their initial values upon completion the infinitesimal for the internal energy infinitesimal process exact differential the symbol for exact differentials the lowercase letter neither the infinitesimal increments nor infinitesimal process represents the state the thus infinitesimal increments heat and work are inexact the lowercase greek letter the symbol for inexact differentials the integral any inexact differential over the time takes for system leave and return the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal recounted the section headed entropy the second law thermodynamics observes that heat supplied system which irreversible processes take place and which has defined temperature the increment heat and the temperature form the exact differential and that the entropy the working function likewise with defined behind the moving the work and the combine form the exact differential with the volume the which state for homogeneous associated with this differential equation that the internal energy may considered function its natural variables and the internal energy representation the fundamental thermodynamic relation written constant and constant with the enthalpy defined the enthalpy may considered function its natural variables and the enthalpy representation the fundamental thermodynamic relation written the internal energy representation and the enthalpy representation are partial legendre transforms one they contain the same physical written different like the internal the enthalpy stated function its natural variables thermodynamic potential and contains all thermodynamic information about heat added body constant pressure quantity heat added body while does expansion work its one has this constrained happen constant pressure with the expansion work done the body given recalling the first law one has substitution one has this the increase enthalpy equal the quantity heat added the since many processes take place constant approximately atmospheric the enthalpy therefore sometimes given the misleading name heat sometimes also called the heat terms the natural variables and the state function this process change state from state state can expressed known that the temperature identically stated consequently this the integral specifies quantity heat transferred constant entropy entropy german physicist rudolf clausius referring closed which transfer matter does not defined the second fundamental theorem the second law thermodynamics the mechanical theory heat thermodynamics two transformations without necessitating any other permanent can mutually replace one called then the generations the quantity heat from work the temperature has the equivalence value came define the entropy symbolized such due the supply the amount heat temperature the entropy the system increased transfer energy heat without work being there are changes entropy both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains the entropy the system may considered consist two that the entropy the and further that may considered the and said therefore thus this may also written the total change entropy the system and surroundings thus this may also written then said that amount entropy has been transferred from the surroundings the because entropy not conserved this exception the general way which amount transferred conserved the second law thermodynamics observes that natural transfer energy which the temperature the system different from that the always that for purposes mathematical analysis one thinks fictive processes that are called with the temperature the system being hardly less than that the and the transfer taking place imperceptibly slow following the definition above formula for such fictive process quantity transferred heat inexact differential analyzed quantity with exact differential this equality only valid for fictive transfer which there production that which there uncompensated the process and can really with then there entropy production with the quantity was termed clausius the uncompensated though that does not accord with day then one has this leads the statement which the second law thermodynamics for closed equilibrium thermodynamics that approximates assuming the hypothesis local thermodynamic there special notation for the transfer energy heat assumed take place across infinitesimal temperature that the system element and its surroundings have near enough the same temperature then one writes where definition the second law for natural process asserts that latent and sensible heat lecture entitled living and heat james prescott joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat components heat each affecting distinct physical namely the potential and kinetic energy respectively quotations described latent energy the energy possessed via distancing particles where attraction was over greater form potential energy and the sensible heat energy involving the motion particles what was known living force the time joule kinetic energy either held internally held externally was known living force latent heat the heat released absorbed chemical substance thermodynamic system during change state that occurs without change such process may phase transition such the melting ice the boiling the term was introduced around joseph black derived from the latin latere lie hidden characterizing its effect not being directly measurable with sensible contrast latent the heat transferred thermodynamic system that has its sole effect change both latent heat and sensible heat transfers increase the internal energy the system which they are consequences distinction between sensible and latent heat are examined the wikipedia article calorimetry specific heat specific heat also called specific heat capacity defined the amount energy that has transferred from one unit mass amount substance mole change the system temperature one degree specific heat physical which means that depends the substance under consideration and its state specified its the specific heats monatomic gases helium are nearly constant with diatomic gases such hydrogen display some temperature and triatomic gases carbon still relation between hotness and temperature according hotness its tendency transfer energy all physical systems are capable heating cooling this does not require that they have thermodynamic with reference the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined the rule that heat flows from the hotter body the physical system inhomogeneous very rapidly irregularly for example may impossible characterize but still there can transfer energy heat between and another system has physical state that regular and persists long enough allow reach thermal equilibrium with specified then has temperature according that empirical thermometer registers degree hotness for such such temperature called for truesdell writes about classical each the body assigned real number called the temperature this number measure how hot the body physical systems that are too turbulent have temperatures may still differ physical system that passes heat another physical system said the hotter the more required for the system have thermodynamic its behavior must regular that its empirical temperature the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled and then its hotness said lie the dimensional hotness this part the reason why heat defined following odory and solely occurring other than work transfer temperature advisedly and deliberately not mentioned this now widely accepted this also the reason why the zeroth law thermodynamics stated three physical and are each not their own states internal thermodynamic possible with suitable physical connections being made between can heat and can heat and can heat equilibrium cycles flow are the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility not open thermodynamic systems distinguished amongst physical which are their own states internal thermodynamic this the reason why the zeroth law thermodynamics needs explicit that the relation not colder between general equilibrium physical systems not whereas the relation has lower temperature between thermodynamic systems their own states internal thermodynamic equilibrium follows from this that the relation thermal equilibrium which one way stating the zeroth just temperature may undefined for sufficiently inhomogeneous also may entropy undefined for system not its own state internal thermodynamic for the temperature the solar not defined likewise the entropy the solar not defined classical has not been possible define equilibrium simple number for whole clearly satisfactory rigorous definition quantity energy transferred heat sometimes convenient have rigorous definition quantity energy transferred such definition customarily based the work carath odory referring processes closed the internal energy body arbitrary state can determined amounts work adiabatically performed the body its surrounds when starts from reference state such work assessed through quantities defined the surroundings the supposed that such work can assessed without error due friction the friction the body not excluded this the adiabatic performance work defined terms adiabatic which allow transfer energy but other energy particular they not allow the passage energy according this work performed adiabatically general accompanied friction within the thermodynamic system the other according odory there also exist adiabatic which are postulated permeable only and are called for the definition quantity energy transferred customarily envisaged that arbitrary state interest reached from state process with two one adiabatic and the other not for convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum work done the body through volume change through movement the walls while the adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered and isochoric adiabatic then the adiabatic component process energy transfer through the wall that passes only newly made accessible for the purpose this from the surroundings the the change internal energy reach the state from the state the difference the two amounts energy although odory himself did not state such following his work customary theoretical studies define the quantity energy transferred the body from its the combined process change state from the state the change internal minus the amount done the body its surrounds the adiabatic that this for the sake conceptal the quantity energy transferred heat not specified directly terms the adiabatic defined through knowledge precisely two the change internal energy and the amount adiabatic work for the combined process change from the reference state the arbitrary state important that this does not explicitly involve the amount energy transferred the adiabatic component the combined assumed here that the amount energy required pass from state state the change internal independently the combined determination through purely adiabatic like that for the determination the internal energy state above the rigour that prized this definition that there one and only one kind energy transfer admitted energy transferred energy transfer heat considered derived the uniqueness work this scheme considered guarantee rigor and purity the conceptual purity this based the concept energy transferred work ideal relies the idea that some frictionless and otherwise dissipative processes energy transfer can realized physical the second law the other assures that such processes are not found heat temperature and thermal equilibrium regarded jointly primitive notions before the rigorous mathematical definition heat based paper recounted just historically heat temperature and thermal equilibrium were presented thermodynamics textbooks jointly primitive notions carath odory introduced his paper the proposition that the discipline thermodynamics can justified without recourse any hypothesis that cannot verified experimentally must regarded one the most noteworthy results the research thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last referring the point view adopted most authors who were active the last fifty carath odory there exists physical quantity called heat that not identical with the mechanical quantities force pressure etc and whose variations can determined calorimetric james serrin introduces account the theory thermodynamics the following shall use the classical notions heat work and hotness primitive that heat appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted its continued validity primitive element thermodynamical structure due the fact that synthesizes essential physical well its successful use recent work unify different constitutive this traditional kind presentation the basis thermodynamics includes ideas that may summarized the statement that heat transfer purely due spatial uniformity and conduction and from hotter colder sometimes proposed that this traditional kind presentation necessarily rests circular against this there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development the theory presented truesdell and bharatha this alternative approach the definition quantity energy transferred heat differs logical structure from that recounted just this alternative approach admits calorimetry primary direct way measure quantity energy transferred relies temperature one its primitive and used presupposed that enough processes exist physically allow measurement differences internal such processes are not restricted adiabatic transfers energy they include which the commonest practical way finding internal energy the needed temperature can either empirical absolute the odory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry temperature its primary definition quantity energy transferred the dory way regards calorimetry only secondary indirect way measuring quantity energy transferred recounted more detail just the odory way regards quantity energy transferred heat process primarily directly defined residual calculated from the difference the internal energies the initial and final states the and from the actual work done the system during the that internal energy difference supposed have been measured advance through processes purely adiabatic transfer energy processes that take the system between the initial and final the odory way presupposed known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic that there need recourse calorimetry for measurement quantity energy transferred this presupposition essential but explicitly labeled neither law thermodynamics nor axiom the odory the actual physical existence such adiabatic processes indeed mostly and those supposed processes have most cases not been actually verified empirically heat transfer engineering heat transfer radiation the discipline heat transfer typically considered aspect mechanical engineering and chemical engineering deals with specific applied methods which thermal energy system transferred another although the definition heat implicitly means the transfer the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage many engineering disciplines and laymen heat transfer includes the mechanisms heat conduction thermal radiation and mass transfer the term convective heat transfer used describe the combined effects conduction and fluid from the thermodynamic point heat flows into fluid diffusion increase its the fluid then transfers advects this increased internal energy not from one location and this then followed second thermal interaction which transfers heat second body again this entire process often regarded additional mechanism heat although heat and thus heating and cooling occurs only either end such conductive but not result thus conduction can said transfer heat only net result the but may not every time within the complicated convective although distinct physical laws may describe the behavior each these real systems often
