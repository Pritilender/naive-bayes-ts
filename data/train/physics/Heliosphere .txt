beyond the orbit neptune this supersonic wind must slow down meet the gases the interstellar medium this takes place several the solar wind traveling supersonic speeds within the solar the termination shock standing shock wave the solar wind falls below the speed sound and becomes subsonic was previously held once the solar wind might affected the ambient flow the interstellar its pressures were theorized cause the solar wind form nose one side and like heliotail the area called the heliosheath however scientific results showed that this model thought filled with magnetic bubble foam the outer surface the where the heliosphere meets the interstellar called the heliopause this the edge the entire scientific results adjusted this the heliopause causes turbulence the interstellar medium the sun orbits the galactic center outside the would turbulent region caused the pressure the advancing heliopause against the interstellar medium however the velocity solar wind relative the interstellar medium probably too low for bow termination shock the termination shock the point the heliosphere where the solar wind slows down subsonic speed relative the because interactions with the local interstellar medium this causes compression heating and change the magnetic field the solar system the termination shock believed astronomical units from the voyager crossed the sun termination shock followed voyager the shock arises because solar wind particles are emitted from the sun about while the speed sound the interstellar about the exact speed depends the which fluctuates the interstellar although very low nonetheless has constant pressure associated with the pressure from the solar wind decreases with the square the distance from the one moves far enough away from the the pressure from the interstellar medium becomes sufficient slow the solar wind down below its speed this causes shock wave other termination shocks can seen terrestrial perhaps the easiest may seen simply running water tap into sink creating hydraulic jump upon hitting the floor the the flowing water spreads out speed that higher than the local wave speed forming disk rapidly diverging flow analogous the supersonic solar around the periphery the shock front wall water outside the shock the water moves slower than the local wave speed analogous the subsonic interstellar going outward from

passed the termination shock december when was about from the virtue the change magnetic readings taken from the voyager began detecting returning particles when was only from the may this implies that the heliosphere may irregularly bulging outwards the northern hemisphere and pushed inward the heliosheath the heliosheath the region the heliosphere beyond the termination here the wind

the coma and trails several times that distance the direction opposite the path through its windward its thickness estimated between and however scientific results showed that model may the voyager and voyager spacecraft are currently studying the late voyager reached region the heliosheath where the solar velocity had dropped astronomers announced that the voyagers had determined that the heliosheath not but filled with million wide bubbles created the impact the solar wind and the interstellar voyager and began detecting evidence for the bubbles and respectively the probably shaped bubbles are formed magnetic reconnection between oppositely oriented sectors the solar magnetic field the solar wind slows they probably represent contained structures that have detached from the interplanetary magnetic field heliopause the heliopause the theoretical boundary where the sun solar wind stopped the interstellar medium where the solar strength longer great enough push back the stellar winds the surrounding the crossing the heliopause should signaled sharp drop the temperature charged change the direction the magnetic and increase the amount galactic cosmic may voyager detected rapid increase such cosmic rays increase following more gradual increase from suggesting was approaching the the fall nasa announced that voyager had crossed the heliopause august this was distance billion from the hypotheses according one there exists region hot hydrogen known the hydrogen wall between the bow shock and the the wall composed interstellar material interacting with the edge the one paper released studied the concept bow wave and hydrogen another hypothesis suggests that the heliopause could smaller the side the solar system facing the orbital motion through the may also vary depending the current velocity the solar wind and the local density the interstellar known lie far outside the orbit neptune the current mission the voyager and spacecraft find and study the termination heliosheath and meanwhile the interstellar boundary explorer mission attempting image the heliopause from earth orbit within two years its launch initial results october from ibex suggest that previous assumptions are insufficiently cognisant the true complexities the when particles emitted the sun bump into the interstellar they slow down while releasing many particles accumulate and around the highly energised their negative creating shock alternative definition that the heliopause the magnetopause between the solar magnetosphere and the plasma heliotail the heliotail the solar tail can understood the tail the similarly can compared which also has further explanation the tail region where the million mile per hour solar wind flows down and ultimately escapes the slowly evaporating because charge the shape this newly found tail interstellar boundary explorer that leaf due the particles the they not therefore cannot seen with conventional ibex has made the first observations using technique called energetic neutral atom which the process measuring the neutral particles created collisions the solar the tail has shown obtain fast and slow the slow particles are the side and the fast particles are encompassed the the shape the tail can linked the sun sending out fast solar winds near its poles and slow solar wind near its equator more the shaped tail moves further away from the which makes the charged particles begin morph into new interactions with ism ori orion nebula was long hypothesized that the sun produces shock its travels within the interstellar medium would occur the interstellar medium moving supersonically toward the since its solar wind moves away from the sun when the interstellar wind hits the heliosphere slows and creates region bow shock was thought possibly occur about but was determined probably does not this conclusion was resulted from new the velocity the lism local interstellar relative the was previously measured ulysses whereas ibex measured this phenomenon has been observed outside our solar around stars other than the now retired orbital galex telescope the red giant star mira the constellation

interstellar spacecraft such pioneer pioneer and voyager are traveling outward through the solar system and will eventually pass through the cassini results rather than like the heliosphere appears shaped according data from cassini ion and neutral camera mimi inca rather than being dominated the collisions between the solar wind and the interstellar the inca ena maps suggest that the interaction controlled more particle pressure and magnetic field energy the new shape from the data thought more like spherical than cometary interstellar boundary explorer results initial data from interstellar boundary explorer launched october revealed previously unpredicted very narrow ribbon that two three times brighter than anything else the initial interpretations suggest that the interstellar environment has far more influence structuring the heliosphere than anyone previously one knows what creating the ena energetic neutral ribbon but everyone agrees that means the textbook
