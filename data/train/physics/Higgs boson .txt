elementary particles and forces give rise the world around nowadays physicists explain the behaviour these particles and how they interact using the standard model widely accepted and remarkably accurate framework based gauge invariance and symmetries believed explain almost everything the world other than gravity but around all attempts create gauge invariant theory for two the four fundamental forces had consistently failed one crucial although gauge invariance seemed extremely seemed make any theory electromagnetism and the weak force demanding that either many particles with

consistently gave answers and predictions that were confirmed including very accurate predictions several other particles note scientists began believe this might true and search for proof whether not higgs field exists this field did this would monumental discovery for science and human and expected open doorways new knowledge many then other more complicated theories would need the easiest proof whether not the field existed was searching for new kind particle would have give known higgs the higgs these would extremely difficult was only many years later that experimental technology became sophisticated enough answer the while several symmetries nature are spontaneously broken through form the higgs the context the standard model the term higgs almost always means symmetry breaking the electroweak field considered but the exact cause has been exceedingly difficult prove after years the higgs existence apparently proven would finally confirm that the standard model essentially correct and allow further while its existence would mean that other theories are needed various analogies have also been invented describe the higgs field and including analogies with known symmetry

already brought major developments for the world wide web used today was created physicists working global collaborations particle experiments cern share their and the results massive amounts data

six authors the prl papers who received the sakurai prize for their from left kibble guralnik hagen englert brout right higgs particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated exchange particles gauge bosons acting force carriers the beginning the number these particles had been discovered along with theories suggesting how they relate each some which had already been reformulated field theories which the objects study are not particles and but quantum fields and their symmetries however attempts unify known fundamental forces such the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known one known omission was that gauge invariant approaches including non abelian models such yang mills theory which held great promise for unified also seemed predict known massive particles goldstone theorem relating continuous symmetries within some also appeared rule out many obvious since appeared show that mass particles would have also exist that were simply not according guralnik physicists had how these problems could particle physicist and mathematician peter woit summarised the state research the perturbation theory confinement qcd both and superconductivity text the higgs mechanism process which vector bosons can get rest mass without explicitly breaking gauge invariance byproduct spontaneous symmetry breaking the mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was initially conceived and published within particle physics yoichiro nambu the concept that such mechanism could offer possible solution for the mass was originally suggested philip anderson who had previously written papers broken symmetry and its outcomes superconductivity and concluded his paper mills theory that considering the superconducting hese two types bosons seem capable canceling each other leaving finite mass and abraham klein and benjamin lee showed march that theorem could avoided this way least some relativistic cases and speculated might possible truly relativistic these approaches were quickly developed into full relativistic model independently and almost three groups fran ois englert and robert brout august peter higgs october and gerald guralnik carl hagen and tom kibble november higgs also wrote short but important response published september objection gilbert which showed that calculating within the radiation goldstone theorem and objection would become note higgs later described objection prompting his own properties the model were further considered guralnik higgs kibble and further ghk the original three papers showed that when gauge theory combined with additional field that spontaneously breaks the the gauge bosons can consistently acquire finite steven weinberg and abdus salam independently showed how higgs mechanism could used break the electroweak symmetry sheldon glashow unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions itself extension work schwinger forming what became the standard model particle weinberg was the first observe that this would also provide mass terms for the note however the seminal papers spontaneous breaking gauge symmetries were first largely because was widely believed that the abelian theories question were and particular that they could not renormalised martinus veltman and gerard hooft proved renormalisation mills was possible two papers covering and then fields their and work the renormalization group including substantial theoretical work russian physicists was eventually enormously profound and but even with all key elements the eventual theory published there was still almost wider for coleman found study that essentially one paid any paper prior now the most cited particle physics and even according politzer glashow teaching the weak interaction contained mention salam own politzer almost everyone learned the theory due physicist benjamin lee who combined the work veltman and hooft with insights and popularised the completed this from interest and acceptance exploded and the ideas were quickly absorbed the the resulting electroweak theory and standard model have correctly predicted among other weak neutral currents three bosons the top and charm quarks and with great the mass and other properties some note many those involved eventually won nobel prizes other renowned paper and comprehensive review reviews modern physics commented that while one doubted the correctness these one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough take advantage adding that the theory had far produced meaningful answers that accorded with but was unknown whether the theory was actually and again the became possible write that understanding and proving the higgs sector the standard model was the central problem today particle summary and impact the prl papers wikinews sakurai prize awarded for higgs boson theory work prospective nobel prize for higgs boson work disputed the three papers written were each recognised milestone papers during physical review letters anniversary their six authors were also awarded the sakurai prize for theoretical particle physics for this controversy also arose the same because the event nobel prize only three scientists could with six being credited for the two the three prl papers higgs and contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known the higgs field and its hypothetical quantum the higgs higgs subsequent paper showed the decay mechanism the only massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the citation needed the paper higgs the boson and closing sentence higgs writes that essential the theory the prediction incomplete multiplets scalar and vector bosons frank close comments that gauge theorists were focused the problem massless vector bosons and the implied existence massive scalar boson was not seen only higgs directly addressed the paper ghk the boson massless and decoupled from the massive reviews dated and guralnik states that the ghk model the boson massless only order but not subject any constraint and acquires mass higher and adds that the ghk paper was the only one show that there are massless goldstone bosons the model and give complete analysis the general higgs all three reached similar despite their very different higgs paper essentially used classical englert and involved calculating vacuum polarization perturbation theory around assumed breaking vacuum and ghk used operator formalism and conservation laws explore depth the ways which theorem may worked addition explaining how mass acquired vector the higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the boson and boson masses well their couplings with each other and with the standard model quarks and citation needed subsequently many these predictions have been verified precise measurements performed the lep and the slc colliders thus overwhelmingly confirming that some kind higgs mechanism does take place but the exact manner which happens has not yet been citation needed the results searching for the higgs boson are expected provide evidence about how this realized citation needed theoretical properties higgs mechanism theoretical need for the higgs symmetry breaking local symmetry gauge invariance important property modern particle theories such the standard model partly due its success other areas fundamental physics such electromagnetism and the strong interaction quantum chromodynamics however there were great difficulties developing gauge theories for the weak nuclear force possible unified electroweak interaction fermions with mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot gauge this can seen examining the dirac lagrangian for fermion terms left and right handed find none the half particles could ever flip helicity required for they must note and bosons are observed have but boson mass term contains which clearly depend the choice gauge and therefore these masses too cannot gauge therefore seems that none the standard model fermions bosons could begin with mass inbuilt property except abandoning gauge gauge invariance were then these particles had acquiring their mass some other mechanism additionally whatever was giving these particles their had not break gauge invariance the basis for other parts the theories where worked and had not require predict unexpected massless particles and range forces seemingly inevitable consequence goldstone theorem which did not actually seem exist solution all these overlapping problems came from the discovery previously unnoticed borderline case hidden the mathematics note that under certain conditions might theoretically possible for symmetry broken without disrupting gauge invariance and without any new massless particles and having sensible renormalisable results this became known the higgs mechanism the standard model hypothesizes field which responsible for this called the higgs field which has the unusual property zero amplitude its ground state zero vacuum expectation value can have this effect because its unusual mexican shaped potential whose lowest point not its centre below certain extremely high energy level the existence this zero vacuum expectation spontaneously breaks electroweak gauge symmetry which turn gives rise the higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition mass those particles interacting with the this effect occurs because scalar field components the higgs field are absorbed the massive bosons degrees freedom and couple the fermions via yukawa coupling thereby producing the expected mass effect when symmetry breaks under these the goldstone bosons that arise interact with the higgs field and with other particles capable interacting with the higgs instead becoming new massless the intractable problems both underlying theories neutralise each and the residual outcome that elementary particles acquire consistent mass based how strongly they interact with the higgs the simplest known process capable giving mass the gauge bosons while remaining compatible with gauge theories its quantum would scalar boson known the higgs particles standard model properties the standard model higgs the standard the higgs field consists four two neutral ones and two charged component fields both the charged components and one the neutral fields are goldstone bosons which act the longitudinal polarization components the massive and bosons the quantum the remaining neutral component corresponds and theoretically realised the massive higgs since the higgs field scalar field meaning does not transform under lorentz transformations the higgs boson has spin the higgs boson also its own antiparticle and even and has zero electric and colour charge the minimal standard model does not predict the mass the higgs that mass between and then the standard model can valid energy scales all the way the planck scale gev many theorists expect new physics beyond the standard model emerge the based unsatisfactory properties the standard the highest possible mass scale allowed for the higgs boson some other electroweak symmetry breaking tev beyond this the standard model becomes inconsistent without such because unitarity violated certain scattering also although experimentally estimate the mass the higgs boson the standard the higgs boson has number indirect most higgs loops result tiny corrections masses and precision measurements electroweak such the fermi constant and masses can used calculate constraints the mass the july the precision electroweak measurements tell that the mass the higgs boson likely less than about confidence level this upper limit would increase the lower bound from the direct search allowed for these indirect constraints rely the assumption that the standard model may still possible discover higgs boson above these masses accompanied other particles beyond those predicted the standard production feynman diagrams gluon fusion higgs strahlung vector boson fusion top fusion higgs particle theories are then higgs particle can produced much like other particles that are particle collider this involves accelerating large number particles extremely high energies and extremely close the speed light then allowing them smash protons and lead ions the bare nuclei lead atoms are used the the extreme energies these the desired esoteric particles will occasionally produced and this can detected and any absence difference from theoretical expectations can also used improve the the relevant particle theory this case the standard will determine the necessary kinds collisions and the standard model predicts that higgs bosons could formed number although the probability producing higgs boson any collision always expected very for only higgs boson per billion collisions the large hadron note the most common expected processes for higgs boson production gluon fusion the collided particles are hadrons such the proton antiproton the case the lhc and then most likely that two the gluons binding the hadron together the easiest way produce higgs particle the two gluons combine form loop virtual quarks since the coupling particles the higgs boson proportional their this process more likely for heavy practice enough consider the contributions virtual top and bottom quarks the heaviest this process the dominant contribution the lhc and tevatron being about ten times more likely than any the other higgs strahlung elementary fermion collides with quark with quark electron with positron the two can merge form virtual boson carries sufficient can then emit higgs this process was the dominant production mode the where electron and positron collided form virtual and was the second largest contribution for higgs production the the lhc this process only the third because the lhc collides protons with making antiquark collision less likely than the higgs strahlung also known associated production weak boson fusion another possibility when two fermions collide that the two exchange virtual which emits higgs the colliding fermions not need the same for quark may exchange boson with down this process the second most important for the production higgs particle the lhc and top fusion the final process that commonly considered far the least likely two orders this process involves two colliding which each decay into heavy antiquark quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine form higgs decay decay width quantum mechanics predicts that possible for particle decay into set lighter then will eventually this also true for the higgs the likelihood with which this happens depends variety factors the difference the strength the etc most these factors are fixed the standard except for the mass the higgs boson for higgs boson with mass the predicts mean life time about note branching ratios since interacts with all the massive elementary particles the the higgs boson has many different processes through which can each these possible processes has its own expressed the branching ratio the fraction the total number decays that follows that the predicts these branching ratios function the higgs mass see one way that the higgs can decay splitting into antifermion general the higgs more likely decay into heavy fermions than light because the mass fermion proportional the strength its interaction with the this logic the most common decay should into top antitop quark however such decay only possible the higgs heavier than twice the mass the top for higgs mass the predicts that the most common decay into bottom antibottom quark which happens the the second most common fermion decay that mass tau antitau which happens only about the another possibility for the higgs split into pair massive gauge the most likely possibility for the higgs decay into pair bosons the light blue line the which happens about the time for higgs boson with mass the bosons can subsequently decay either into quark and antiquark into charged lepton and however the decays bosons into quarks are difficult distinguish from the and the decays into leptons cannot fully reconstructed because neutrinos are impossible detect particle collision cleaner signal given decay into pair bosons which happens about the time for higgs with mass each the bosons subsequently decays into pair detect charged leptons electrons muons decay into massless gauge bosons gluons photons also but requires intermediate loop virtual heavy quarks top massive gauge the most common such process the decay into pair gluons through loop virtual heavy this which the reverse the gluon fusion process mentioned happens approximately the time for higgs boson with mass much rarer the decay into pair photons mediated loop bosons heavy which happens only twice for every thousand however this process very relevant for experimental searches for the higgs because the energy and momentum the photons can measured very giving accurate reconstruction the mass the decaying alternative models alternatives the standard model higgs the minimal standard model described above the simplest known model for the higgs mechanism with just one higgs however extended higgs sector with additional higgs particle doublets triplets also and many extensions the standard model have this the minimal higgs sector favoured theory are the two doublet models which predict the existence quintet scalar two even neutral higgs bosons and odd neutral higgs boson and two charged higgs particles supersymmetry susy also predicts relations between the boson masses and the masses the gauge and could accommodate neutral higgs the key method distinguish between these different models involves study the interactions coupling and exact decay processes branching which can measured and tested experimentally particle the hdm model one higgs doublet couples and down while the second doublet does not couple this model has two interesting which the lightest higgs couples just fermions phobic just gauge bosons fermiophobic but not the hdm one higgs doublet only couples type the other only couples type the heavily researched minimal supersymmetric standard model includes hdm higgs could disproven evidence hdm citation needed other models the higgs scalar composite for technicolor the role the higgs field played strongly bound pairs fermions called techniquarks other feature pairs top quarks see top quark condensate yet other there higgs field all and the electroweak symmetry broken using extra feynman diagram hierarchy problem further theoretical issues and hierarchy problem hierarchy problem hierarchy problem the higgs mass the standard model leaves the mass the higgs boson parameter rather than value this seen theoretically particularly quantum corrections related interactions with virtual particles should apparently cause the higgs particle have mass immensely higher than that but the same time the standard model requires mass the order gev ensure unitarity this unitarise longitudinal vector boson reconciling these points appears require explaining why there perfect cancellation resulting the visible mass gev and not clear how because the weak force about times stronger than and linked the higgs mass much less than the planck mass the grand unification energy appears that either there some underlying connection reason for these observations which unknown and not described the standard some unexplained and extremely precise fine tuning parameters however present neither these explanations this known hierarchy problem more the hierarchy problem amounts the worry that future theory fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive tunings unduly delicate and should allow masses particles such the higgs boson the problem some ways unique particles such the higgs which can give rise issues related quantum corrections that not affect particles with number solutions have been proposed including supersymmetry conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such braneworld models experimental search search for the higgs boson produce higgs bosons two beams particles are accelerated very high energies and allowed collide within particle detector occasionally although higgs boson will created fleetingly part the collision because the higgs boson decays very particle detectors cannot detect instead the detectors register all the decay products the decay signature and from the data the decay process the observed decay products match possible decay process known decay channel higgs this indicates that higgs boson may have been many processes may produce similar decay fortunately the standard model precisely predicts the likelihood each and each known occurring the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching higgs boson than would otherwise expected higgs bosons did not then this would strong evidence that the higgs boson because higgs boson production particle collision likely very rare billion the note and many other possible collision events can have similar decay the data hundreds trillions collisions needs analysed and must show the same before conclusion about the existence the higgs boson can conclude that new particle has been particle physicists require that the statistical analysis two independent particle detectors each indicate that there lesser than million chance that the observed decay signatures are due just background random standard model that the observed number events more than standard deviations different from that expected there was new more collision data allows better confirmation the physical properties any new particle and allows physicists decide whether indeed higgs boson described the standard model some other hypothetical new find the higgs powerful particle accelerator was because higgs bosons might not seen energy the collider needed have high luminosity order ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions finally advanced computing facilities were needed process the vast amount data petabytes per year produced the for the announcement july new collider known the large hadron collider was constructed cern with planned eventual collision energy tev over seven times any previous and over trillion lhc proton collisions were analysed the lhc computing grid the largest computing grid comprising over computing facilities worldwide network across countries search prior july the first extensive search for the higgs boson was conducted the large positron collider cern the the end its service lep had found conclusive evidence for the note this implied that the higgs boson were exist would have heavier than the search continued fermilab the united where the tevatron the collider that discovered the top quark had been upgraded for this there was guarantee that the tevatron would able find the but was the only supercollider that was operational since the large hadron collider was still under construction and the planned superconducting super collider had been cancelled and never the tevatron was only able exclude further ranges for the higgs and was shut down september because longer could keep with the the final analysis the data excluded the possibility higgs boson with mass between and there was small but not excess events possibly indicating higgs boson with mass between and the large hadron collider cern switzerland was

operational readiness was delayed for months magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural caused faulty electrical connection that damaged over superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum data collection the lhc finally commenced march december the two main particle detectors the atlas and cms had narrowed down the mass range where the higgs could exist around gev and gev there had also already been number promising event excesses that had evaporated and proven nothing but random however from around may both experiments had seen among their the slow emergence small yet consistent excess gamma and lepton decay signatures and several other particle all hinting new particle mass around gev around november the anomalous data gev was becoming too large although still far from and the team leaders both atlas and cms each privately suspected they might have found the november internal meeting the two team leaders and the director general the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first suggesting both atlas and cms might converging possible shared result and initial preparations commenced case successful while this information was not known publicly the the narrowing the possible higgs range around gev and the repeated observation small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels both atlas and cms the gev region described tantalising around sigma were public knowledge with lot was therefore widely anticipated around the end that the lhc would provide sufficient data either exclude confirm the finding higgs

escalated fevered pitch when reports emerged that peter higgs who proposed the was attending the and that five leading had been invited generally believed signify the five living authors with englert guralnik hagen attending and kibble confirming his invitation brout having died july both the cern experiments announced they had independently made the same cms previously unknown boson with mass gev and atlas boson with mass gev using the combined analysis two interaction types known both experiments reached local significance less than one million chance when additional channels were taken into the cms significance was reduced the two teams had been working from each other from around late early meaning they did not discuss their results with each providing additional certainty that any common finding was genuine validation this level confirmed independently two separate teams and meets the formal level proof required announce confirmed july the atlas collaboration presented additional data analysis the observation new including data from third which improved the significance sigma million chance being due random background and mass gev and cms improved the significance sigma and mass gev the new particle tested possible higgs boson following the discovery was still unconfirmed whether not the gev particle was higgs one observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the standard model higgs and the particle decayed into least some the predicted moreover the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions the standard model within the experimental however the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative meaning announcement the discovery higgs boson would have been allow more opportunity for data the proposed shutdown and upgrade were postponed weeks into november conference kyoto researchers said evidence gathered since july was falling into line with the basic standard model more than its with range results for several interactions matching that physicist matt strassler highlighted considerable evidence that the new particle not pseudoscalar negative parity particle consistent with this required finding for higgs evaporation lack increased significance for previous hints standard model expected standard model interactions with and bosons absence significant new for against supersymmetry and general significant deviations date from the results expected standard model higgs however some kinds extensions the standard model would also show very similar commentators noted that based other particles that are still being understood long after their may take years and decades fully understand the particle that has been these findings meant that january scientists were very sure they had found unknown particle mass and had not been misled experimental error chance they were also from initial that the new particle was some kind the behaviours

physicist and high school teachers cern educator suggests that dispersion light responsible for the rainbow and dispersive prism useful analogy for the higgs symmetry breaking and causing symmetry breaking optics photons wavelengths the same velocity glass water air photons matter different velocities symmetry breaking particle physics matt strassler uses electric fields some particles interact with the higgs field while others those particles that feel the higgs field act they have something similar happens electric field charged objects are pulled around and neutral objects can sail through you can think the higgs search attempt make waves the higgs field create higgs prove really similar explanation was offered the guardian the higgs boson essentially ripple field said have emerged the birth the universe and span the cosmos this day the particle crucial the smoking gun the evidence required show the theory the higgs effect particles was famously described physicist david miller akin room full political party workers spread evenly throughout the crowd gravitates and slows down famous people but does not slow down note also drew attention known effects solid state physics where effective mass can much greater than usual the presence crystal analogies based drag effects including analogies syrup molasses are also well but can somewhat misleading since they may understood saying that the higgs field simply resists some motion but not simple resistive effect could also conflict with newton third law recognition and awards there has been considerable discussion how allocate the credit the higgs boson made more pointed nobel prize had been and the very wide basis people entitled these include range theoreticians who made the higgs mechanism theory the theoreticians the prl papers including higgs the theoreticians who derived from working electroweak theory and the standard model and also the experimentalists cern and other institutions who made possible the proof the higgs field and boson the nobel prize has limit persons share and some possible winners are already prize holders for other are deceased the prize only awarded persons their existing prizes for works relating the higgs boson mechanism nobel prize physics weinberg and salam and for contributions the theory the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary
