technical the talk page may contain november expanding universe generally has cosmological horizon which analogy with the more familiar horizon caused the curvature the marks the boundary the part the universe that observer can light other emitted objects beyond the cosmological horizon never reaches the because the space between the observer and the object expanding too universe gravitational waves light big bang the observable universe one causal patch much larger unobservable there are parts the universe that cannot communicate with these parts the universe are outside our current cosmological the standard hot big bang without the cosmological horizon moves bringing new regions into yet local observer sees these regions for the first they look different from any other region space the local observer has already they have background radiation that nearly exactly the same temperature the background radiation other and their time curvature evolving step with this presents how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed they have learned getting because they were not communication with our past light cone before inflation answers this question postulating that all the regions come from earlier era with big vacuum cosmological space with cosmological constant qualitatively instead moving the cosmological horizon stays for any one the distance the cosmological horizon with exponentially expanding two nearby observers are separated very much that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits the spatial slices are expanding very fast cover huge things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological which fixed distance and everything becomes homogeneous very the inflationary field slowly relaxes the the cosmological constant goes and space begins expand the new regions that come into view during the normal expansion phase are exactly the same regions that were pushed out the horizon during and they are necessarily nearly the same temperature and because they come from the same little patch the theory inflation thus explains why the temperatures and curvatures different regions are nearly also predicts that the total curvature slice constant global time this prediction implies that the total ordinary dark matter and residual vacuum energy the universe have add the critical and the evidence strongly supports more inflation allows physicists calculate the minute differences temperature different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary and many these quantitative predictions have been space expands say that space expands exponentially means that two inertial observers are moving farther apart with accelerating stationary coordinates for one patch inflating universe has the following polar metric this just like out black hole metric has zero the component fixed radius sphere called the cosmological horizon objects are drawn away from the observer towards the cosmological which they cross finite proper this means that any inhomogeneities are smoothed just any bumps matter the surface black hole horizon are swallowed and since the space time metric has explicit time once observer has crossed the cosmological observers closer take its this process falling outward and replacement points closer are always steadily replacing points further exponential expansion this state exponentially expanding spacetime called sitter space and sustain there must cosmological constant vacuum energy proportional everywhere this the equation state the physical conditions from one moment the next are the rate called the hubble parameter nearly and the scale factor the universe proportional inflation often called period accelerated expansion because the distance between two fixed observers increasing exponentially accelerating rate they move while can stay approximately constant see deceleration parameter few inhomogeneities remain cosmological inflation has the important effect smoothing out inhomogeneities anisotropies and the curvature space this pushes the universe into very simple which completely dominated the inflaton the source the cosmological and the only significant inhomogeneities are the tiny quantum fluctuations the inflation also dilutes exotic heavy such the magnetic monopoles predicted many extensions the standard model particle physics the universe was only hot enough form such particles before period they would not observed they would rare that quite likely that there are none the observable universe together these effects are called the inflationary hair analogy with the hair theorem for black holes the theorem works essentially because the cosmological horizon different from hole except for philosophical disagreements about what the other the interpretation the hair theorem that the universe observable and expands enormous factor during expanding energy densities generally get the volume the universe for the density ordinary cold matter goes down the inverse the when linear dimensions the energy density goes down factor the radiation energy density goes down even more rapidly the universe expands since the wavelength each photon stretched redshifted addition the photons being dispersed the when linear dimensions are the energy density radiation falls factor sixteen see the solution the energy density continuity equation for relativistic fluid during the energy density the inflaton field roughly however the energy density everything including curvature anisotropies exotic and model particles and through sufficient inflation these all become this leaves the universe flat and and apart from the homogeneous inflaton mostly the moment inflation ends and reheating key requirement key requirement that inflation must continue long enough produce the present observable universe from small inflationary hubble volume this necessary ensure that the universe appears homogeneous and isotropic the largest observable this requirement generally thought satisfied the universe expanded factor least during reheating inflation period supercooled expansion when the temperature drops factor the exact drop model but the first models was typically from down this relatively low temperature maintained during the inflationary when inflation ends the temperature returns the inflationary this called reheating thermalization because the large potential energy the inflaton field decays into particles and fills the universe with standard model particles including electromagnetic radiation starting the radiation dominated phase the because the nature the inflation not this process still poorly although believed take place through parametric resonance motivations inflation resolves several problems the big bang cosmology that were discovered the inflation was first discovered guth while investigating the problem why magnetic monopoles are seen found that energy false vacuum would according general relativity generate exponential expansion was very quickly realised that such expansion would resolve many other standing these problems arise from the observation that look like does today the universe would have have started from very finely tuned special initial conditions the big inflation attempts resolve these problems providing dynamical mechanism that drives the universe this special thus making universe like ours much more likely the context the big bang horizon problem horizon problem the horizon problem the problem determining why the universe appears statistically homogeneous and isotropic accordance with the cosmological principle for molecules canister gas are distributed homogeneously and isotropically because they are thermal gas throughout the canister has had enough time interact dissipate inhomogeneities and the situation quite different the big bang model without because gravitational expansion does not give the early universe enough time big bang with only the matter and radiation known the standard model two widely separated regions the observable universe cannot have equilibrated because they move apart from each other faster than the speed light thus have never come into causal contact the history the back the earliest has not been possible send light signal between the two because they have difficult explain why they have the same temperature are thermally this because the hubble radius radiation dominated universe expands much more quickly than physical lengths and points that are out communication are coming into historically two proposed solutions were the phoenix universe georges tre and the related oscillatory universe richard chase tolman and the mixmaster universe charles misner lema tre and tolman proposed that universe undergoing number cycles contraction and expansion could come into thermal their models however because the buildup entropy over several misner made the ultimately conjecture that the mixmaster which made the universe more chaotic could lead statistical homogeneity and flatness problem flatness problem another problem the flatness problem which sometimes called one the dicke coincidences with the other being the cosmological constant problem had been known the that the density matter the universe was comparable the critical density necessary for flat universe that universe whose large scale geometry the usual euclidean geometry rather than non euclidean hyperbolic spherical geometry therefore regardless the shape the universe the contribution spatial curvature the expansion the universe could not much greater than the contribution but the universe the curvature redshifts away more slowly than matter and extrapolated into the this presents fine tuning problem because the contribution curvature the universe must exponentially small sixteen orders magnitude less than the density radiation big bang nucleosynthesis for this problem exacerbated recent observations the cosmic microwave background that have demonstrated that the universe flat the accuracy few magnetic monopole problem the magnetic monopole problem sometimes called the relics says that the early universe were very large number very heavy stable magnetic monopoles would this problem with grand unified theories which proposes that high temperatures such the early the electromagnetic force strong and weak nuclear forces are not actually fundamental forces but arise due spontaneous symmetry breaking from single gauge theory these theories predict number stable particles that have not yet been observed the most notorious the magnetic kind heavy knot the magnetic monopoles are expected copiously produced grand unified theories high and they should have persisted the present such extent that they would become the primary constituent the not only that not the but all searches for them have placing stringent limits the density relic magnetic monopoles the period inflation that occurs below the temperature where magnetic monopoles can produced would offer possible resolution this monopoles would separated from each other the universe around them potentially lowering their observed density many orders though cosmologist martin rees has skeptics about exotic physics might not hugely impressed theoretical argument explain the absence particles that are themselves only preventive medicine can readily seem percent effective against disease that history precursors the early days general relativity albert einstein introduced the cosmological constant allow static solution which was dimensional sphere with uniform density little willem sitter found highly symmetric inflating which described universe with cosmological constant that otherwise was discovered that solution and there are small eventually either collapses turns into the early zeldovich noticed the serious flatness and horizon problems big bang before his cosmology was presumed symmetrical purely philosophical citation needed the soviet this and other considerations led belinski and khalatnikov analyze the chaotic bkl singularity general misner mixmaster universe attempted use this chaotic behavior solve the cosmological with limited the late sidney coleman applied the instanton techniques developed alexander polyakov and collaborators study the fate the false vacuum quantum field like metastable phase statistical water below the freezing temperature above the boiling quantum field would need nucleate large enough bubble the new the new order make coleman found the most likely decay pathway for vacuum decay and calculated the inverse lifetime per unit eventually noted that gravitational effects would but did not calculate these effects and did not apply the results the soviet alexei starobinsky noted that quantum corrections general relativity should important the early these generically lead squared corrections the einstein hilbert action and form modified gravity the solution equations the presence curvature squared when the curvatures are leads effective cosmological therefore proposed that the early universe went through sitter inflationary this resolved the problems and led specific predictions for the corrections the microwave background corrections that were calculated detail shortly zeldovich noted the monopole which was unambiguous quantitative version the horizon this time fashionable subfield particle which led several speculative attempts resolve working the alan guth realized that false vacuum decay the early universe would solve the leading him propose scalar driven starobinsky and scenarios both predicted initial desitter differing only the details the early inflationary models according andrei linde the earliest theory inflation was proposed erast gliner but the theory was not taken seriously except andrei sakharov who made attempt calculate density perturbations produced this independently inflation was proposed january alan guth mechanism explain the nonexistence magnetic was guth who coined the term inflation the same starobinsky argued that quantum corrections gravity would replace the initial singularity the universe with exponentially expanding desitter phase october demosthenes kazanas suggested that exponential expansion could eliminate the particle horizon and perhaps solve the horizon while sato suggested that exponential expansion could eliminate domain walls another kind exotic einhorn and sato published model similar and showed that would resolve the puzzle the magnetic monopole abundance grand unified theories like they concluded that such model not only required fine tuning the cosmological but also would very likely lead much too granular large density variations resulting from bubble wall hubble radius gravitational singularity causal guth proposed that the early universe was trapped false vacuum with high energy which much like cosmological constant the very early universe cooled was trapped metastable state was supercooled which could only decay out through the process bubble nucleation via quantum tunneling bubbles true vacuum spontaneously form the sea false vacuum and rapidly begin expanding the speed light guth recognized that this model was problematic because the model did not reheat when the bubbles they did not generate any radiation could only generated collisions between bubble but inflation lasted long enough solve the initial conditions collisions between bubbles became exceedingly any one causal patch likely that only one bubble will slow roll inflation the bubble collision problem was solved andrei linde and independently andreas albrecht and paul steinhardt model named new inflation slow roll inflation model then became known old inflation this instead tunneling out false vacuum inflation occurred scalar field rolling down potential energy when the field rolls very slowly compared the expansion the inflation however when the hill becomes inflation ends and reheating can effects asymmetries was shown that new inflation does not produce perfectly symmetric but that tiny quantum fluctuations the inflaton are these tiny fluctuations form the primordial seeds for all structure created the later these fluctuations were first calculated viatcheslav mukhanov and chibisov the soviet union analyzing similar the context they were worked out independently the work mukhanov and chibisov the week nuffield workshop the very early universe cambridge university the fluctuations were calculated four groups working separately over the course the stephen hawking starobinsky guth and young and james bardeen paul steinhardt and michael turner observational status inflation mechanism for realizing the cosmological principle which the basis the standard model physical accounts for the homogeneity and isotropy the observable accounts for the observed flatness and absence magnetic since early each these observations has received further most impressively the detailed observations the cosmic microwave background made the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe spacecraft this analysis shows that the universe flat accuracy least few and that homogeneous and isotropic part inflation predicts that the structures visible the universe today formed through the gravitational collapse perturbations that were formed quantum mechanical fluctuations the inflationary the detailed form the spectrum perturbations called nearly invariant gaussian random field dovich very specific and has only two free the amplitude the spectrum and the spectral index which measures the slight deviation from scale invariance predicted inflation perfect scale invariance corresponds the idealized sitter inflation predicts that the observed perturbations should thermal equilibrium with each other these are called adiabatic isentropic perturbations this structure for the perturbations has been confirmed the wmap spacecraft and other cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys especially the ongoing sloan digital sky survey these experiments have shown that the one part inhomogeneities observed have exactly the form predicted moreover there evidence for slight deviation from scale the spectral index equal one for invariant the simplest models inflation predict that this quantity between and from the data taken the wmap spacecraft can inferred that implying that differs from one the level two standard deviations this considered important confirmation the theory number theories inflation have been proposed that make radically different but they generally have much more fine tuning than physical however inflation most valuable that robustly predicts the initial conditions the universe based only two adjustable the spectral index that can only change small and the amplitude the except contrived this true regardless how inflation realized particle occasionally effects are observed that appear contradict the simplest models the year wmap data suggested that the spectrum might not nearly but might instead have slight however the year data revealed that the effect was statistical another effect has been remarked upon since the first cosmic microwave background the cosmic background explorer the amplitude the quadrupole moment the cosmic microwave background unexpectedly low and the other low multipoles appear preferentially aligned with the ecliptic plane some have claimed that this signature gaussianity and thus contradicts the simplest models others have suggested that the effect may due other new foreground even publication bias experimental program underway further test inflation with more precise measurements the cosmic microwave high precision measurements the called the polarization the background radiation could provide evidence the gravitational radiation produced and could also show whether the energy scale inflation predicted the simplest models gev march was announced that mode polarization the background radiation consistent with that predicted from inflation had been demonstrated south pole collaboration led four principal investigators from the california institute harvard stanford and the university minnesota bicep other potentially corroborating measurements are expected performed the planck spacecraft although unclear the signal will contamination from foreground sources will interfere with these other forthcoming such those centimeter radiation radiation emitted and absorbed from neutral hydrogen before the first stars turned may measure the power spectrum with even greater resolution than the cosmic microwave background and galaxy although not known these measurements will possible interference with radio sources earth and the galaxy will too dark energy broadly similar and thought causing the expansion the day universe however the energy scale dark energy much roughly orders magnitude less than the scale theoretical status list unsolved problems physics the theory cosmological inflation and what are the details this what the hypothetical inflaton field giving rise the early proposal was thought that the inflaton was the higgs field the field that explains the mass the elementary now believed some that the inflaton cannot the higgs field although the recent discovery the higgs boson has increased the number works considering the higgs field one problem this identification the current tension with experimental data the electroweak which currently under study the large hadron collider other models inflation relied the properties grand unified since the simplest models grand unification have now thought many physicists that inflation will included supersymmetric theory like string theory supersymmetric grand unified while inflation understood principally its detailed predictions the initial conditions for the hot early the particle physics largely hoc modelling though predictions inflation have been consistent with the results observational there are many open questions about the fine tuning problem one the most severe challenges for inflation arises from the need for fine tuning inflationary new the slow roll conditions must satisfied for inflation the roll conditions say that the inflaton potential must flat compared the large vacuum energy and that the inflaton particles must have small mass clarification needed order for the new inflation theory albrecht and steinhardt therefore seemed that the universe must have scalar field with especially flat potential and special initial however there are ways explain these for classically scale invariant field where scale invariance broken quantum provides explanation the flatness inflationary long the theory can studied through perturbation andrei linde andrei linde proposed theory known chaotic inflation which suggested that the conditions for inflation are actually satisfied quite generically and inflation will occur virtually any universe that begins high energy state and has scalar field with unbounded potential however his model the inflaton field necessarily takes values larger than one planck unit for this these are often called large field models and the competing new inflation models are called small field models this the predictions effective field theory are thought renormalization should cause large corrections that could prevent this problem has not yet been resolved and some cosmologists argue that the small field which inflation can occur much lower energy are better models while inflation depends quantum field theory and the semiclassical approximation quantum gravity important has not been completely reconciled with these the bicep experiment detected evidence for primordial gravitational waves consistent with robert brandenberger has commented tuning another the amplitude the primordial inhomogeneities produced inflation directly tied the energy scale there are strong suggestions that this scale around gev times the planck energy the natural scale vely the planck scale this small value could seen another form tuning called hierarchy problem the energy density given the scalar potential down compared the planck density this not usually considered critical however because the scale inflation corresponds naturally the scale gauge eternal inflation eternal inflation many models the inflationary phase the expansion lasts forever least some regions the this occurs because inflating regions expand very reproducing unless the rate decay the inflating phase sufficiently new inflating regions are produced more rapidly than inflating such models most the volume the universe any given time all models eternal inflation produce infinite typically although new inflation classically rolling down the quantum fluctuations can sometimes bring back previous these regions which the inflaton fluctuates upwards expand much faster than regions which the inflaton has lower potential and tend dominate terms physical this steady which first developed called eternal has been shown that any inflationary theory with unbounded potential not citation given popular conclusion among physicists that this steady state cannot continue forever into the the inflationary which similar sitter space incomplete without contracting however unlike sitter fluctuations contracting inflationary space will collapse form gravitational singularity point where densities become therefore necessary have theory for the initial linde however believes inflation may past eternal regions with inflation have exponentially growing while regions that are not inflating this suggests that the volume the inflating part the universe the global picture always unimaginably larger than the part that has stopped even though inflation eventually ends seen any single inflationary scientists disagree about how assign probability distribution this hypothetical anthropic landscape the probability different regions counted one should expect that inflation will never applying boundary conditions that local observer exists observe that inflation will end late some physicists believe this paradox can resolved weighting observers their inflationary initial conditions some physicists have tried avoid the initial conditions problem proposing models for eternally inflating universe with these models propose that while the the largest expands exponentially and always will spatially infinite and has and will forever other proposals attempt describe the nihilo creation the universe based quantum cosmology and the following vilenkin put forth one such hartle and hawking offered the boundary proposal for the initial creation the universe which inflation comes about alan guth has described the inflationary universe the ultimate free new similar our are continually produced vast inflating gravitational this circumvent but not the first law thermodynamics energy conservation and the second law thermodynamics entropy and the arrow time problem however while there consensus that this solves the initial conditions some have disputed much more likely that the universe came about quantum fluctuation donald page was outspoken critic inflation because this stressed that the thermodynamic arrow time necessitates low entropy initial which would highly according rather than solving this the inflation theory further aggravates the reheating the end the inflation era increases making necessary for the initial state the universe even more orderly than other big bang theories with inflation hawking and page later found ambiguous results when they attempted compute the probability inflation the hawking initial other authors have argued since inflation the probability matter long not precisely once inflation perpetuates itself and quickly dominates the however albrecht and lorenzo sorbo have argued that the probability inflationary consistent with emerging random fluctuation from some existent compared with inflationary cosmos overwhelmingly favours the inflationary simply because the seed amount gravitational energy required for the inflationary cosmos much less than any required for inflationary which outweighs any entropic another problem that has occasionally been mentioned the planckian problem planckian since the energy scale inflation and the planck scale are relatively some the quantum fluctuations that have made the structure our universe were smaller than the planck length before therefore there ought corrections from scale particular the unknown quantum theory there has been some disagreement about the magnitude this about whether just the threshold detectability completely hybrid inflation another kind called hybrid inflation extension new introduces additional scalar that while one the scalar fields responsible for normal slow roll another triggers the end when inflation has continued for sufficiently becomes favorable the second field decay into much lower energy hybrid one the scalar fields responsible for most the energy density thus determining the rate while the other responsible for the slow roll thus determining the period inflation and its thus fluctuations the former inflaton would not affect inflation while fluctuations the latter would not affect the rate therefore hybrid inflation not when the second inflaton reaches the bottom its changes the location the minimum the first which leads fast roll the inflaton down its leading termination inflation and string cosmology the discovery flux compactifications have opened the way for reconciling inflation and string new called brane inflation suggests that inflation arises from the motion branes the compactified usually towards stack this governed the dirac infeld action very different from ordinary the dynamics are not completely appears that special conditions are necessary since inflation occurs tunneling between two vacua the string landscape the process tunneling between two vacua form old but new inflation must then occur some other inflation and loop quantum gravity when investigating the effects the theory loop quantum gravity would have loop quantum cosmology model has evolved that provides possible mechanism for cosmological loop quantum gravity assumes quantized the energy density larger than can held the quantized thought bounce inflation and generalized uncertainty principle the effects generalized uncertainty principle the inflationary dynamics and the thermodynamics the early universe are using the gup tawfik evaluated the tensorial and scalar density fluctuations the inflation era and compared them with the standard they found good agreement with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data assuming that quantum gas scalar particles confined within thin layer near the apparent horizon the friedmann walker universe that satisfies the boundary tawfik calculated the number and entropy densities and the free energy arising from the quantum states using the gup furthermore qualitative estimation for effects the quantum gravity all these thermodynamic quantities was alternatives inflation the flatness and horizon problems are naturally solved the einstein cartan kibble theory without needing exotic form matter and introducing free this theory extends general relativity removing constraint the symmetry the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric the torsion tensor dynamical the minimal coupling between torsion and dirac spinors generates spin interaction that significant fermionic matter extremely high such interaction averts the unphysical big bang replacing with like bounce finite minimum scale before which the universe was the rapid expansion immediately after the big bounce explains why the present universe largest scales appears spatially homogeneous and the density the universe the effects torsion weaken and the universe smoothly enters the dominated there are models that explain some the observations explained however none these alternatives has the same breadth explanation and still require inflation for more complete fit with they should therefore regarded adjuncts rather than string theory requires addition the three observable spatial there exist additional dimensions that are curled compactified see also kaluza klein theory extra dimensions appear frequent component supergravity models and other approaches quantum gravity this raised the contingent question why four time dimensions became large and the rest became unobservably attempt address this called string gas cosmology was proposed robert brandenberger and cumrun vafa this model focuses the dynamics the early universe considered hot gas brandenberger and vafa show that dimension spacetime can only expand the strings that wind around can efficiently annihilate each each string dimensional and the largest number dimensions which two strings will generically intersect presumably annihilate therefore one argues that the most likely number compact spatial dimensions current work this model centers whether can succeed stabilizing the size the compactified dimensions and produce the correct spectrum primordial density for recent see the authors admits that their model does not solve the entropy and flatness problems standard cosmology and can provide explanation for why the current universe close being spatially the ekpyrotic and cyclic models are also considered adjuncts these models solve the horizon problem through expanding epoch well before the big and then generate the required spectrum primordial density perturbations during contracting phase leading big crunch the universe passes through the big crunch and emerges hot big bang phase this sense they are reminiscent the oscillatory universe proposed richard chace tolman however model the total age the universe necessarily while these models this not necessarily whether the correct spectrum density fluctuations can and whether the universe can successfully navigate the big big crunch remains topic controversy and current ekpyrotic models avoid the magnetic monopole problem long the temperature the big big bang transition remains below the grand unified this the temperature required produce magnetic monopoles the first things there evidence any slowing the but this not surprising each cycle expected last the order trillion another the varying speed light model has also been theorized jean pierre petit john moffat well andreas albrecht and magueijo instead superluminal expansion the speed light was orders magnitude faster than its current value solving the horizon and homogeneity problems the early criticisms since its introduction alan guth the inflationary paradigm has become widely nevertheless many mathematicians and philosophers science have voiced claiming untestable predictions and alleged lack serious empirical john earman and published thorough critical review inflationary concluding not think that there good grounds for admitting any the models inflation into the standard core order and pointed out roger penrose from inflation requires extremely specific initial conditions its that the problem initial conditions not there something fundamentally misconceived about trying explain the uniformity the early universe resulting from thermalization for the thermalization actually doing anything then represents definite increasing the thus the universe would have been even more special before the thermalization than the problem specific initial conditions would not have been would have gotten recurrent criticism inflation that the invoked inflation field does not correspond any
