completely described independent initial position coordinates and initial velocity given the general solutions second law become particular solutions that determine the time evolution the behaviour after its initial state the most familiar set variables for position and velocity are cartesian coordinates and their time derivatives position and velocity components determining forces terms standard coordinates can and usually requires much alternative and more efficient approach use only many coordinates are needed define the position the the same time incorporating the constraints the and writing down kinetic and potential other determine the number degrees freedom the particle the number possible ways the system can move subject the constraints forces that prevent moving certain energies are much easier write down and calculate than since energy scalar while forces are these coordinates are generalized coordinates denoted and there one for each degree their corresponding time derivatives are the generalized velocities the number degrees freedom usually not equal the number spatial multi body systems dimensional space such barton pendulums planets the solar system atoms molecules can have many more degrees freedom incorporating rotations well this contrasts the number spatial coordinates used with laws mathematical formulation the position vector standard coordinate system like spherical related the generalized coordinates some transformation equation where there are many needed number degrees freedom the likewise for velocity and generalized for for simple

then applying the chain rule the derivative with respect kinetic energy relations the kinetic energy for the system particles defined the partial derivatives with respect the generalized coordinates and generalized velocities are because and are independent then the total time derivative this equation resulting generalized equations motion laws are contained yet there need find the constraint forces because virtual work and generalized coordinates which account for are this equation itself not actually used but step towards deriving equations see lagrangian and action the core element lagrangian mechanics the lagrangian function which summarizes the dynamics the entire system very simple the physics analyzing system reduced choosing the most convenient set generalized determining the kinetic and potential energies the constituents the then writing down the equation for the lagrangian use defined where the total kinetic energy and the total potential energy the the next fundamental element the action defined the time integral the this also contains the dynamics the and has deep theoretical implications discussed technically action functional rather than function its

volume integral where differential volume element must used the action becomes integral over space and hamilton principle stationary action let and the coordinates respective initial and final times and using the calculus variations can shown that equations are equivalent hamilton principle the trajectory the system between and has stationary action stationary mean that the action does not vary order from infinitesimal deformations the with the points and fixed hamilton principle can written thus instead thinking about particles accelerating response applied one might think them picking out the path with stationary hamilton principle sometimes referred the principle least action however the action functional need only stationary not necessarily maximum minimum any variation the functional gives increase the functional integral the can use this principle instead newton laws the fundamental principle this allows use integral principle laws are based differential equations they are differential the basis for however not widely stated that principle variational principle only with holonomic constraints are dealing with nonholonomic systems then the variational principle should replaced with one involving alembert principle virtual work working only with holonomic constraints the price have pay for using elegant variational formulation lagrange equations the first kind lagrange introduced analytical method for finding stationary points using the method lagrange multipliers and also applied for system subject the constraint equation the generalized where then lagrange equations the first kind are where the lagrange analogy with the mathematical can where denotes the variational derivative for constraint equations there lagrange multiplier for each constraint and equations the first kind generalize lagrange equations this procedure does increase the number but there are enough solve for all the the number equations generated the number constraint equations plus the number the advantage the method that potentially substitution and elimination variables linked constraint equations can there connection between the constraint equations and the constraint forces acting the conservative system forces are which derived and using the kinetic energy equation motion blue box for conservative systems see and equating leads and finally equating equations the first kind each constraint equation corresponds constraint force conservative lagrange equations the second kind euler lagrange equations for any system with degrees the lagrange equations include generalized coordinates and generalized below sketch out the derivation the lagrange equations the second this used rather than for potential energy and replaces for kinetic energy see the references for more detailed and more general the equations motion lagrangian mechanics are the lagrange equations the second kind also known the euler lagrange equations lagrange equations where represents the degree are the generalized coordinates and are the generalized velocities although the mathematics required for equations appears significantly more complicated than this does point deeper insights into classical mechanics than laws symmetry and practice often easier solve problem using the lagrange equations than because the minimum generalized coordinates can chosen convenience exploit symmetries the and constraint forces are incorporated into the geometry the there one lagrange equation for each generalized coordinate for system many each particle can have different numbers degrees freedom from the each the lagrange the total kinetic energy the and the total potential derivation equations hamilton principle the lagrange equations follow directly from and are mathematically from the calculus variations any functional the leads the general euler lagrange equation for stationary value see main article for then making the yields the lagrange equations for since mathematically hamilton equations can derived from equations legendre transformation and equations can derived from all which are equivalent and summarize classical this means classical mechanics fundamentally ruled variation principle principle generalized forces for conservative since the potential field only function not lagrange equations also follow directly from the equation motion simplifying this consistent with the results derived above and may seen differentiating the right side the lagrangian with respect and and solely with respect adding the results and associating terms with the equations for and newton laws the following derivation new physics the lagrange equations can describe the dynamics classical system equivalently consider single particle with mass and position vector moving under applied conservative force which can expressed the gradient scalar potential energy function such force independent order derivatives consider arbitrary displacement the the work done the applied force using second since work physical scalar should able rewrite this equation terms the generalized coordinates and the left hand the right hand carrying out change coordinates generalized now integrating parts the summand with respect then differentiating with respect allows the sum written recognizing that now changing the order finally change the order which equivalent where total kinetic energy the the equation for the work done becomes this must true for any set generalized displacements must have for each generalized coordinate can further simplify this noting that function solely and and function the generalized coordinates and therefore independent the generalized inserting this into the preceding equation and substituting called the obtain when the generalized coordinates are simply the cartesian straightforward check that equations reduce second dissipation function rayleigh dissipation function more general the forces could both potential and viscous appropriate transformation can found from the rayleigh suggests using dissipation the following where are constants that are related the damping coefficients the physical though not necessarily equal them defined this then and examples this section two examples are provided which the above concepts are the first example establishes that simple the newtonian approach and the lagrangian formalism the second case illustrates the power the above case that hard solve with falling mass consider point mass falling freely from gravity force exerted the mass assuming constant during the filling the force find from which the solution follows taking the antiderivative the and choosing the origin the starting this result can also derived through the lagrangian take the which the starting the kinetic energy and the potential energy mgx hence then which can rewritten yielding the same result pendulum movable support consider pendulum mass and length which attached support with mass which can move along line the let the coordinate along the line the and let denote the position the pendulum the angle from the the kinetic energy can then shown and the potential energy the system the lagrangian therefore now carrying out the differentiations gives for the support coordinate indicating the presence constant performing the same procedure for the variable yields therefore these equations may look quite but finding them with laws would have required carefully identifying all which would have been much more laborious and prone considering limit the correctness this system can for should give the equations motion for pendulum that rest some inertial frame while should give the equations for pendulum constantly accelerating etc furthermore trivial obtain the results given suitable starting conditions and chosen time stepping through the results iteratively two body central force problem the basic problem that two bodies orbit about each other attracted central the jacobi coordinates are namely the location the center mass and the separation the bodies the relative the lagrangian then where the total the reduced mass and the potential the radial the lagrangian divided into center mass term and relative motion term the equation from the lagrange system resulting simple motion the center mass straight line constant the relative motion expressed polar coordinates which does not depend upon therefore ignorable coordinate the lagrange equation for where the conserved angular the lagrange equation for this equation identical the radial equation obtained using laws rotating reference that frame rotating with the reduced mass appears the angular velocity replaced its value terms the angular the radial equation which the equation motion for dimensional problem which particle mass subjected the inward central force and second outward called this context the centrifugal force one remains entirely within the dimensional enters only some imposed parameter the external outward and its interpretation angular momentum depends upon the more general dimensional problem from which the dimensional problem one arrives this equation using newtonian mechanics rotating the interpretation evident the centrifugal force that frame due the rotation the frame one arrives this equation directly using the generalized coordinates and simply following the lagrangian formulation without thinking about frames the interpretation that the centrifugal force outgrowth using polar coordinates hildebrand since such quantities are not true physical they are often called inertia forces their presence absence not upon the particular problem but upon the coordinate system chosen cartesian coordinates are the centrifugal force and the formulation involves only the central force which provides the centripetal force for curved this that fictitious forces originate the choice often expressed users the lagrangian this view arises naturally the lagrangian because the frame reference possibly selected the choice unfortunately this usage inertial conflicts with the newtonian idea inertial the newtonian inertial force originates the acceleration the frame observation the fact that not inertial frame reference not the choice coordinate keep matters safest refer the lagrangian inertial forces generalized inertial distinguish them from the newtonian vector inertial that one should avoid following hildebrand when says deal always with generalized forces velocities and for the adjective generalized will omitted known that
