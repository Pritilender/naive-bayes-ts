operational history inaugural tests the first beam was circulated through the collider the morning september cern successfully fired the protons around the tunnel three kilometres the particles were fired clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around local the lhc successfully completed its major after series trial two white dots flashed computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length the took less than one hour guide the stream particles around its inaugural cern next successfully sent beam protons counterclockwise taking slightly longer one and half hours due problem with the cryogenics with the full circuit being completed quench incident september magnet quench occurred about bending magnets sectors and where electrical fault led loss approximately six tonnes liquid helium the cryogenic coolant which was vented into the the escaping vapor expanded with explosive force damaging over superconducting magnets and their and contaminating the vacuum pipe which also lost vacuum shortly after the incident cern reported that the most likely cause the problem was faulty electrical connection between two and due the time needed warm the affected sectors and then cool them back down operating would take least two months cern released interim technical report and preliminary analysis the incident and october respectively and more detailed report december the analysis the incident cern confirmed that electrical fault had indeed been the the faulty electrical connection had led failsafe power abort the electrical systems powering the superconducting but had also caused electric arc which damaged the integrity the supercooled enclosure and vacuum causing the temperature and pressure rapidly rise beyond the ability the safety systems contain and leading temperature rise about degrees celsius some the affected energy stored the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced other quench detectors also played role the rapid around two tonnes liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered emergency and further four tonnes leaked lower pressure the total magnets were

large extra dimensions constrained versions the minimal supersymmetric standard model and may was reported that quark gluon plasma the densest matter besides black holes has been created the between july and august results searches for the higgs boson and for exotic based the data collected during the first half the run were presented conferences grenoble and the latter conference was reported despite hints higgs signal earlier atlas and cms exclude with confidence level using the cls method the existence higgs boson with the properties predicted the standard model over most the mass region between and gev the searches for new particles did not yield signals allowing further constrain the parameter space various extensions the standard including its supersymmetric extensions december cern reported that the standard model higgs most likely have mass constrained the range gev both the cms and atlas detectors have also shown intensity peaks the gev consistent with either background noise the observation the higgs december was reported that new particle had been the bottomonium state july both the cms and atlas teams announced the discovery boson the mass region around gev with statistical significance the level sigma this meets the formal level required announce new particle which consistent with the higgs but scientists are cautious whether formally identified actually being the higgs pending further november the lhcb team reported experiment seen golden test supersymmetry theories measuring the very rare decay the meson into two muons the which match those

pushed the completion date from april the superconducting magnets were responsible for sfr the cost there were also further costs and delays due engineering difficulties encountered while building the underground cavern for the compact muon solenoid and also due faulty parts provided due lower electricity costs during the expected that the lhc will normally not operate over the winter although
