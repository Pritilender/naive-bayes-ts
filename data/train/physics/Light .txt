visible light usually defined having wavelength the range nanometres nanometres between the infrared with longer wavelengths and the ultraviolet with shorter these numbers not represent the absolute limits human but the approximate range within which most people can see reasonably well under most various sources define visible light narrowly broadly under ideal laboratory people can see infrared least children and young adults ultraviolet down about primary properties visible light are intensity propagation frequency wavelength spectrum and polarisation while its speed meters per one the fundamental constants visible with all types electromagnetic radiation experimentally found always move this speed citation needed common with all types visible light emitted and absorbed tiny packets

exactly approximately miles per the fixed value the speed light units results from the fact that the metre now defined terms the speed all forms electromagnetic radiation move exactly this same speed different physicists have attempted measure the speed light throughout galileo attempted measure the speed light the seventeenth early experiment measure the speed light was conducted ole mer danish using telescope mer observed the motions jupiter and one its moons noting discrepancies the apparent period calculated that light takes about minutes traverse the diameter earth however its size was not known that mer had known the diameter the would have calculated speed another more measurement the speed light was performed europe hippolyte fizeau fizeau directed beam light mirror several kilometers rotating cog wheel was placed the path the light beam traveled from the the mirror and then returned its fizeau found that certain rate the beam would pass through one gap the wheel the way out and the next gap the way knowing the distance the the number teeth the and the rate fizeau was able calculate the speed light foucault used experiment which used rotating mirrors obtain value albert michelson conducted experiments the speed light from until his death refined methods using improved rotating mirrors measure the time took light make round trip from wilson san antonio california the precise measurements yielded speed the effective velocity light various transparent substances containing ordinary matter less than for example the speed light water about that extreme example the nature slowing two independent teams physicists were able bring light complete passing through bose einstein condensate the element rubidium one team harvard university and the rowland institute for science mass and the other the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics also however the popular description light being stopped these experiments refers only light being stored the excited states then emitted arbitrary later stimulated second laser during the time had stopped had ceased electromagnetic spectrum and visible light electromagnetic spectrum electromagnetic spectrum emr the designation excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields classified wavelength into radio microwave infrared the visible region that perceive ultraviolet rays and gamma rays the behaviour emr depends its higher frequencies have shorter and lower frequencies have longer when emr interacts with single atoms and its behaviour depends the amount energy per quantum emr the visible light region consists quanta called photons that are the lower end the energies that are capable causing electronic excitation within which lead changes the bonding chemistry the the lower end the visible light emr becomes invisible humans infrared because its photons longer have enough individual energy cause lasting molecular change change the visual molecule retinal the human which change triggers the sensation there exist animals that are sensitive various types but not means infrared sensing snakes depends kind natural thermal imaging which tiny packets cellular water are raised temperature the infrared emr this range causes molecular vibration and heating which how these animals detect above the range visible ultraviolet light becomes invisible mostly because absorbed the cornea below nanometers and the internal lens below furthermore the rods and cones located the retina the human eye cannot detect the very short below ultraviolet and are fact damaged many animals with eyes that not require lenses such insects and are able detect quantum absorption much the same chemical way that humans detect visible optics optics the study light and the interaction light and matter termed optics the observation and study optical phenomena such rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many clues the nature refraction refraction cloud sunlight refraction the bending light rays when passing through surface between one transparent material and described snell law where the angle between the ray and the surface normal the first the angle between the ray and the surface normal the second and and are the indices refraction vacuum and transparent substance when beam light crosses the boundary between vacuum and another between two different the wavelength the light but the frequency remains the beam light not orthogonal rather the the change wavelength results change the direction the this change direction known refraction the refractive quality lenses frequently used manipulate light order change the apparent size magnifying glasses spectacles contact lenses microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples this light sources list light sources there are many sources the most common light sources are body given temperature emits characteristic spectrum black body radiation simple thermal source sunlight the radiation emitted the chromosphere the sun around kelvin peaks the visible region the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted wavelength units and roughly sunlight energy that reaches the ground another example incandescent light bulbs which emit only around their energy visible light and the remainder common thermal light source history the glowing solid particles flames but these also emit most their radiation the and only fraction the visible the peak the blackbody spectrum the deep about micrometer wavelength for relatively cool objects like human the temperature the peak shifts shorter producing first red then white and finally white colour the peak moves out the visible part the spectrum and into the these colours can seen when metal heated red white blue white thermal emission not often except stars the commonly seen blue colour gas flame welder torch fact due molecular notably radicals emitting wavelength band around and not seen stars pure thermal atoms emit and absorb light characteristic this produces emission lines the spectrum each emission can spontaneous light emitting diodes gas discharge lamps such neon lamps and neon signs mercury vapor lamps etc and flames light from the hot gas for sodium gas flame emits characteristic yellow emission can also stimulated laser microwave maser deceleration free charged such electron can produce visible cyclotron radiation synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples particles moving through medium faster than the speed light that medium can produce visible cherenkov radiation certain chemicals produce visible radiation chemoluminescence living this process called bioluminescence for fireflies produce light this and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce glowing certain substances produce light when they are illuminated more energetic process known fluorescence some substances emit light slowly after excitation more energetic this known phosphorescence phosphorescent materials can also excited bombarding them with subatomic cathodoluminescence one this mechanism used cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors city artificial lighting certain other mechanisms can produce bioluminescence cherenkov radiation electroluminescence scintillation sonoluminescence triboluminescence when the concept light intended include energy photons gamma additional generation mechanisms particle antiparticle annihilation radioactive decay units and measures photometry radiometry light measured with two main alternative sets radiometry consists measurements light power all while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect standardised model human brightness photometry for quantify illumination intended for human the units for both systems are summarised the following table radiometry units radiant energy joule energy radiant flux watt power spectral power radiant intensity steradian angle spectral intensity radiance metre projected area confusingly called intensity some other fields spectral radiance metre watt per steradian per square metre per hertz wavelength frequency irradiance radiant flux density sometimes confusingly called intensity spectral

luminous exposure lux second luminous energy density metre luminous efficacy watt radiant flux luminous efficiency luminous coefficient photometry radiometry compare the photometry units are different from most systems physical units that they take into account how the human eye responds the cone cells the human eye are three types which respond differently across the visible and the cumulative response peaks wavelength around therefore two sources light which produce the same intensity visible light not necessarily appear equally the photometry units are designed take this into and therefore are better representation how bright light appears than raw they relate raw power quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks indoor and outdoor the illumination measured photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond what perceived the human and without filters which may photocells and charge coupled devices tend respond some infrared ultraviolet light pressure radiation pressure light exerts physical pressure objects its phenomenon which can deduced but can more easily explained the particle nature photons strike and transfer their light pressure equal the power the light beam divided the speed due the magnitude the effect light pressure negligible for everyday for milliwatt laser pointer exerts force about piconewtons the object being thus one could lift penny with laser but doing would require about billion laser however nanometre scale applications such nems the effect light pressure more and exploiting light pressure drive nems mechanisms and flip scale physical switches integrated circuits active area larger light pressure can cause asteroids spin acting their irregular shapes the vanes windmill the possibility making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships space also under although the motion the crookes radiometer was originally attributed light this interpretation the characteristic crookes rotation the result partial this should not confused with the nichols radiometer which the motion caused torque though not enough for full rotation against

that light was mechanical property the luminous rejecting the forms ibn haytham and witelo well the species bacon grosseteste and kepler published theory the refraction light that incorrectly that light travelled faster denser medium than less dense descartes arrived this conclusion analogy with the behaviour sound waves citation needed although descartes was incorrect about the relative was correct assuming that light behaved like wave and concluding that refraction could explained the speed light different descartes not the first use the mechanical analogies but because clearly asserts that light only mechanical property the luminous body and the transmitting descartes theory light regarded the start modern physical particle theory corpuscular theory light pierre gassendi pierre gassendi proposed particle theory light which was published posthumously the isaac newton studied work early and preferred his view theory the plenum stated his hypothesis light that light was composed corpuscles particles which were emitted all directions from one arguments against the wave nature light was that waves were known bend around while light travelled only straight however explain the phenomenon the diffraction light which had been observed francesco grimaldi allowing that light particle could create localised wave the aether newton theory could used predict the reflection but could only explain refraction incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering denser medium because the gravitational pull was newton published the final version his theory his opticks his reputation helped the particle theory light hold sway during the the particle theory light led laplace argue that body could massive that light could not escape from other words would become what now called black hole laplace withdrew his suggestion after wave theory light became firmly established the model for light has been neither particle wave theory fully translation essay light appears the large scale structure stephen hawking and george ellis the fact that light could polarized was for the first time qualitatevily explained newton using the particle louis malus created mathematical particle theory jean baptiste biot showed that this theory explained all known phenomena light that time the polarization was considered the prove the particle wave theory explain the origin robert hooke developed pulse and compared the spreading light that waves water his micrographia observation hooke suggested that vibrations could perpendicular the direction christiaan huygens worked out mathematical wave theory light and published his treatise light proposed that light was emitted all directions series waves medium called the luminiferous ether waves are not affected was assumed that they slowed down upon entering denser thomas young diffraction the wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves noted around thomas young young showed means diffraction experiment that light behaved also proposed that different colours were caused different wavelengths and explained colour vision terms coloured receptors the another supporter the wave theory was leonhard euler argued nova theoria lucis colorum that diffraction could more easily explained wave ampere gave fresnel idea that the polarization light can explained the wave theory light were transverse wave later augustin jean fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory and presented the acad mie des sciences sim denis poisson added mathematical work produce convincing argument favour the wave helping overturn corpuscular the year fresnel was able show via mathematical methods that polarisation could explained only the wave theory light and only light was entirely with longitudinal vibration the weakness the wave theory was that light like sound would need medium for the existence the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed huygens was cast into strong doubt the late nineteenth century the michelson morley experiment newton corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster denser while the wave theory huygens and others implied the that the speed light could not measured accurately enough decide which theory was the first make sufficiently accurate measurement was foucault his result supported the wave and the classical particle theory was finally only partly emerge the electromagnetic theory explanation for all types visible light and all radiation electromagnetic radiation linearly polarised electric field magnetic field transverse wave michael faraday discovered that the plane polarisation linearly polarised light rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction the presence transparent dielectric effect now known faraday rotation this was the first evidence that light was related electromagnetism speculated that light might some form disturbance propagating along magnetic field faraday proposed that light was frequency electromagnetic which could propagate even the absence medium such the faraday work inspired james clerk maxwell study electromagnetic radiation and maxwell discovered that propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space constant which happened equal the previously measured speed from maxwell concluded that light was form electromagnetic first stated this result physical lines force published treatise electricity and magnetism which contained full mathematical description the behaviour electric and magnetic still known maxwell equations soon heinrich hertz confirmed theory experimentally generating and detecting radio waves the and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible exhibiting properties such refraction diffraction and maxwell theory and experiments led directly the development modern radar television electromagnetic and wireless the quantum photons are seen wave packets the waves described the classical theory the quantum theory was needed explain effects even with visual light that classical theory could not such spectral lines quantum theory max planck attempting explain black body radiation suggested that although light was these waves could gain lose energy only finite amounts related their planck called these lumps light energy quanta from latin word for how albert einstein used the idea light quanta explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had real existence arthur holly compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity rays scattered from electrons called compton scattering could explained theory but not wave gilbert lewis named these liqht quanta particles photons eventually the modern theory quantum mechanics came picture light some both particle and and another phenomenon which neither particle nor wave which actually are macroscopic such baseballs ocean instead modern physics sees light something that can described sometimes with mathematics appropriate one type macroscopic metaphor and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor water but actually something that cannot fully the case for radio waves and the rays involved compton physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends behave more like classical wave lower but more like classical particle higher but never completely loses all qualities one the visible which occupies middle ground can easily shown experiments describable using either wave particle sometimes see also automotive lighting ballistic
