object made from material that magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic everyday example refrigerator magnet used hold notes refrigerator materials that can which are also the ones that are strongly attracted are called ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic these include iron nickel cobalt some alloys rare earth metals and some naturally occurring minerals such lodestone although ferromagnetic and materials are the only ones attracted magnet strongly enough commonly considered all other substances respond weakly magnetic one several other types magnetism ferromagnetic materials can divided into magnetically soft materials like annealed iron which can magnetized but not tend stay and magnetically hard materials which permanent magnets are made from hard ferromagnetic materials such alnico and ferrite that are subjected special processing powerful magnetic field during align their internal microcrystalline structure making them very hard demagnetize saturated certain magnetic field must and this threshold depends coercivity the respective hard materials have high whereas soft materials have low electromagnet made from coil wire that acts magnet when electric current passes through but

notes references external links discovery and development history electromagnetism magnetism history ancient people learned about magnetism from lodestones naturally magnetized pieces iron they are naturally created which attract pieces the word magnet greek meant stone from part ancient greece where lodestones were lodestones suspended they could turn were the first magnetic compasses the earliest known surviving descriptions magnets and their properties are from india and china around years the properties lodestones and their affinity for iron were written pliny the elder his encyclopedia naturalis historia the centuries magnetic compasses were used navigation europe and physics magnetic field magnetic field the magnetic flux density also called magnetic field just magnetic usually denoted vector field the magnetic field vector given point space specified two its direction which along the orientation compass needle its magnitude also called strength which proportional how strongly the compass needle orients along that units the strength the magnetic field given teslas magnetic moment magnetic moment magnetic moment also called magnetic dipole moment and usually denoted vector that characterizes the overall magnetic for bar the direction the magnetic moment points from the south pole its north and the magnitude relates how strong and how far apart these poles units the magnetic moment specified terms amperes times meters magnet both produces its own magnetic field and responds magnetic the strength the magnetic field produces any given point proportional the magnitude its magnetic when the magnet put into external magnetic produced different subject torque tending orient the magnetic moment parallel the the amount this torque proportional both the magnetic moment and the external magnet may also subject force driving one direction according the positions and orientations the magnet and the field uniform the magnet subject net although subject wire the shape circle with area and carrying current with magnetic moment magnitude equal magnetization magnetization the magnetization magnetized material the local value its magnetic moment per unit usually denoted with units vector field rather than just vector like the magnetic because different areas magnet can magnetized with different directions and strengths for because see good bar magnet may have magnetic moment magnitude and volume and therefore average magnetization magnitude iron can have magnetization around million amperes per such large value explains why iron magnets are effective producing magnetic modelling magnets two definitions moment two different models exist for magnetic poles and atomic although for many purposes convenient think magnet having distinct north and south magnetic the concept poles should not taken merely way referring the two different ends the magnet does not have distinct north south particles opposing bar magnet broken into two attempt separate the north and south the result will two bar each which has both north and south however version the pole approach used professional magneticians design permanent citation needed this the divergence the magnetization inside magnet and the surface normal component are treated distribution magnetic monopoles this mathematical convenience and does not imply that there are actually monopoles the the pole distribution then the pole model gives the magnetic field outside the the field proportional while inside the magnetization must added extension this method that allows for internal magnetic charges used theories another model the amp model where all magnetization due the effect circular bound currents also called rian throughout the for uniformly magnetized cylindrical

atoms inside the material are generally canceled currents neighboring only the surface makes net shaving off the outer layer magnet will not destroy its magnetic but will leave new surface uncancelled currents from the circular currents throughout the the right hand rule tells which direction the current pole naming conventions the north pole magnet the pole when the magnet freely points towards the north magnetic pole the since opposite poles north and attract the north magnetic pole actually the south pole the magnetic practical tell which pole magnet north and which not necessary use the magnetic field for one method would compare electromagnet whose poles can identified the right hand rule the magnetic field lines magnet are considered convention emerge from the north pole and reenter the south magnetic materials magnetism the term magnet typically reserved for objects that produce their own persistent magnetic field even the absence applied magnetic only certain classes materials can most however produce magnetic field response applied magnetic phenomenon known there are several types and all materials exhibit least one the overall magnetic behavior material can vary depending the structure the particularly its electron configuration several forms magnetic behavior have been observed different including ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are the ones normally thought they are attracted magnet strongly enough that the attraction can these materials are the only ones that can retain magnetization and become common example traditional refrigerator magnet ferrimagnetic which include ferrites and the oldest magnetic materials magnetite and lodestone are similar but weaker than the difference between and ferrimagnetic materials related their microscopic explained magnetism paramagnetic substances such platinum aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted either pole this attraction hundreds thousands times weaker than that ferromagnetic can only detected using sensitive instruments using extremely strong magnetic ferrofluids although they are made tiny ferromagnetic particles suspended are sometimes considered paramagnetic since they cannot diamagnetic means repelled both compared paramagnetic and ferromagnetic diamagnetic such carbon copper water and plastic are even more weakly repelled the permeability diamagnetic materials less than the permeability vacuum all substances not possessing one the other types magnetism are this includes most although force diamagnetic object from ordinary magnet far too weak using extremely strong superconducting magnets diamagnetic objects such pieces lead and even mice can levitated they float superconductors repel magnetic fields from their interior and are strongly there are various other types such spin glass superparamagnetism superdiamagnetism and metamagnetism common uses hard disk drives magnetic recording vhs tapes contain reel magnetic tape the information that makes the

containing cathode ray tube employ electromagnet guide electrons the plasma screens and lcds use different speakers and microphones most speakers employ permanent magnet and carrying coil convert electric energy the into mechanical energy movement that creates the the coil wrapped around bobbin attached the speaker cone and carries the signal changing current that interacts with the field the permanent the voice coil feels magnetic force and moves the cone and pressurizes the neighboring thus generating sound dynamic microphones employ the same but microphone has diaphragm membrane attached coil the coil rests inside specially shaped when sound vibrates the the coil vibrated the coil moves through the magnetic voltage induced across the this voltage drives current the wire that characteristic the original electric guitars use magnetic pickups transduce the vibration guitar strings into electric current that can then amplified this different from the principle behind the speaker and dynamic microphone because the vibrations are sensed directly the and diaphragm not the hammond organ used similar with rotating tonewheels instead electric motors and generators some electric motors rely upon combination electromagnet and permanent and much like they convert electric energy into mechanical generator the converts mechanical energy into electric energy moving

such medical issues and safety because human tissues have very low level susceptibility static magnetic there little mainstream scientific evidence showing health hazard associated with exposure

permanent magnets ferrite magnets magnetic metallic elements many materials have unpaired electron and the majority these materials are paramagnetic when the spins interact with each other such way that the spins align the materials are called ferromagnetic what often loosely termed because the way their regular crystalline atomic structure causes their spins some metals are ferromagnetic when found their natural ores these include iron ore magnetite lodestone cobalt and nickel well the rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium when very low such naturally occurring ferromagnets were used the first experiments with technology has since expanded the availability magnetic materials include various made all however naturally magnetic composites ceramic ferrite magnets are made sintered composite powdered iron oxide and strontium carbonate ceramic given the low cost the materials and manufacturing inexpensive magnets magnetized ferromagnetic for use electronic components such radio antennas for various shapes can easily the resulting magnets are corroding but brittle and must treated like other alnico magnets are made casting sintering combination aluminium nickel and cobalt with iron and small amounts other elements added enhance the properties the sintering offers superior mechanical whereas casting delivers higher magnetic fields and allows for the design intricate alnico magnets resist corrosion and have physical properties more forgiving than but not quite desirable trade names for alloys this family alni alcomax hycomax columax and ticonal injection molded magnets are composite various types resin and magnetic allowing parts complex shapes manufactured injection the physical and magnetic properties the product depend the raw but are generally lower magnetic strength and resemble plastics their physical flexible magnets are composed coercivity ferromagnetic compound usually ferric oxide mixed with plastic this extruded sheet and passed over line powerful cylindrical permanent these magnets are arranged stack with alternating magnetic poles facing rotating this impresses the plastic sheet with the magnetic poles alternating line electromagnetism used generate the the pole distance the order but varies with these magnets are lower magnetic strength but can very depending the binder rare earth magnets rare earth magnet earth magnet rare earth lanthanoid elements have partially occupied electron shell which can accommodate electrons the spin these electrons can resulting very strong magnetic and these elements are used compact strength magnets where their higher price not the most common types earth magnets are samarium cobalt and neodymium boron magnets single molecule magnets and chain magnets the was discovered that certain molecules containing paramagnetic metal ions are capable storing magnetic moment very low these are very different from conventional magnets that store information magnetic domain level and theoretically could provide far denser storage medium than conventional this research monolayers smms currently under very the two main attributes smm large ground state spin value which provided ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic metal centres negative value the anisotropy the zero field splitting most smms contain manganese but can also found with iron nickel and cobalt more has been found that some chain systems can also display magnetization that persists for long times higher these systems have been called chain nano structured magnets some structured materials exhibit energy waves called magnons that coalesce into common ground state the manner bose einstein condensate costs the current cheapest permanent allowing for field are flexible and ceramic but these are also among the weakest the ferrite magnets are mainly cost magnets since they are made from cheap raw iron oxide and however new low cost alloy citation needed has been developed and now dominating the cost magnets has higher saturation magnetization than the ferrite also has more favorable temperature although can thermally neodymium boron magnets are among the these cost more per kilogram than most other magnetic materials owing their intense are smaller and cheaper many temperature temperature sensitivity but when magnet heated temperature known the curie point loses all its even after cooling below that the magnets can often however additionally some magnets are brittle and can fracture high the maximum usable temperature highest for alnico magnets over around for ferrite and about for nib and lower for flexible but the exact numbers depend the grade electromagnets electromagnet its simplest wire that has been coiled into one more known solenoid when electric current flows through the magnetic field concentrated near and especially the and its field lines are very similar those the orientation this effective magnet determined the right hand rule

magnetic properties cardboard will tend generate very weak however wrapped around soft ferromagnetic such iron then the net field produced can result several thousandfold increase field uses for electromagnets include particle accelerators electric motors junkyard and magnetic resonance imaging machines some applications involve configurations more than simple magnetic for quadrupole and sextupole magnets are used focus particle beams units and calculations magnetostatics for most engineering mks units are commonly two other sets gaussian and cgs emu are the same for magnetic properties and are commonly used all convenient employ two types magnetic and well the magnetization defined the magnetic moment per unit the magnetic induction field given units teslas the magnetic

thus giving the unit flux the unit the gauss one tesla equals the magnetic field given units turns per meter the turns appears because when produced carrying its value proportional the number turns that the unit the oersted one equals the magnetization given units amperes per meter the unit the oersted one equals good permanent magnet can have magnetization large million amperes per the relation holds where the permeability which equals written the pole approach gives term must then supplement this give the correct field within the will agree with the field calculated using rian materials that are not permanent magnets usually satisfy the relation where the magnetic most magnetic materials have relatively small the order but soft magnets can have the order hundreds for materials satisfying can also write where the relative permeability and the magnetic both hard and soft magnets have more history behavior described what are called hysteresis loops which give either but and caution part because there are not enough roman and greek there commonly upon symbol for magnetic pole strength and magnetic the symbol has been used for both pole strength unit where here the upright for and for magnetic moment unit the symbol has been used some texts for magnetic permeability and other texts for magnetic will use for magnetic permeability and for magnetic for pole will employ for bar magnet section with uniform magnetization along its the pole strength given that can thought pole strength per unit fields magnet far away from the magnetic field created that magnet almost always described good dipole field characterized its total magnetic this true regardless the shape the long the magnetic moment one characteristic dipole field that the strength the field falls off inversely
