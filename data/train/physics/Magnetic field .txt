field density rotating magnetic fields diagrams history history electromagnetic theory descartes although magnets and magnetism were known much the study magnetic fields began when french scholar petrus peregrinus maricourt mapped out the magnetic field the surface spherical magnet using iron noting that the resulting field lines crossed two points named those points analogy also clearly articulated the principle that magnets alway have both north and south matter how finely one slices almost three centuries william gilbert colchester replicated petrus work and was the first state explicitly that earth published gilbert magnete helped establish magnetism john michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel accordance with inverse square charles augustin coulomb experimentally verified this and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot building this force between sim denis poisson created the first successful model the magnetic which presented this magnetic field produced magnetic and magnetism due small pairs south magnetic three discoveries challenged this foundation though first hans christian oersted discovered that electric current generates magnetic field encircling then andr marie showed that parallel wires having currents the same direction attract one finally jean baptiste biot and lix savart discovered the biot savart law which correctly predicts the magnetic field around any carrying extending these amp published his own successful model magnetism showed the equivalence electrical currents magnets and proposed that

describing the force between two currents and amp law which like the savart correctly described the magnetic field generated steady also this amp introduced the term electrodynamics describe the relationship between electricity and michael faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when found that changing magnetic field generates encircling electric described this phenomenon what known faraday law induction later franz ernst neumann proved for moving conductor magnetic induction consequence force the process introduced the magnetic vector potential which was later shown equivalent the underlying mechanism proposed lord kelvin then known william distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted and the former applied model and the latter model and further derived how and relate each between and james clerk maxwell developed and published maxwell equations which explained and united all classical electricity and the first set these equations was published paper entitled physical lines force these equations were valid although maxwell completed his set equations his later paper dynamical theory the electromagnetic field and demonstrated the fact that light electromagnetic wave heinrich hertz experimentally confirmed this fact the twentieth century extended electrodynamics include relativity and quantum albert einstein his paper that established showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part the same phenomena viewed from different reference see moving magnet and conductor problem for details about the thought experiment that eventually helped albert einstein develop special relativity finally the emergent field quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics form quantum electrodynamics definitions units and measurement definition magnetic flux density magnetic induction magnetic field magnetic field intensity magnetic field strength magnetic field magnetizing field the magnetic field can defined several equivalent ways based the effects has its often the magnetic field defined the force exerts moving charged known from experiments electrostatics that particle charge electric field experiences force however other such when charged particle moves the vicinity carrying the force also depends the velocity that fortunately the velocity dependent portion can separated out such that the force the particle satisfies the lorentz force law here the velocity and denotes the cross product the vector termed the magnetic and defined the vector field necessary make the lorentz force law correctly describe the motion charged this definition allows the determination the following way measure the direction and magnitude the vector such and such calls for the following take particle known charge measure the force determine then measure the force the particle when its velocity repeat with some other now find that makes the lorentz force fit all these that the magnetic field the place alternatively the magnetic field can defined terms the torque produces magnetic dipole see magnetic torque permanent magnets below addition there quantity which also sometimes called the magnetic and are proportional each with the multiplicative constant depending the physical inside material they are different see and inside and outside magnetic materials the term magnetic field historically reserved for while using other

through their effects local charged for electrons spiraling around field line produce synchrotron radiation that detectable radio waves magnetic field lines field line compasses mapping the magnetic field object simple first measure the strength and direction the magnetic field large number locations every point then mark each location with arrow called vector pointing the direction the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional the strength the magnetic alternative method map the magnetic field the arrows form magnetic field lines the direction the magnetic field any point parallel the direction nearby field and the local density field lines can made proportional its magnetic field lines are like the contour lines constant topographic map that they represent something and different mapping scale would show more fewer advantage using magnetic field lines representation that many laws magnetism and can stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such the field lines through these concepts can quickly their mathematical for the number field lines through given surface the surface integral the magnetic field lines iron filings various phenomena have the effect displaying magnetic field lines though the field lines are physical for iron filings placed magnetic field line form lines that correspond field magnetic lines are also visually displayed polar auroras which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks light that line with the local direction magnetic field lines can used qualitative tool visualize magnetic ferromagnetic substances like iron and magnetic forces can understood imagining that the field lines exert tension like rubber along their and pressure perpendicular their length neighboring field poles magnets attract because they are linked many field poles repel because their field lines not but run pushing each the rigorous form this concept the electromagnetic energy tensor magnetic field and permanent magnets magnet permanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic they are made ferromagnetic materials such iron and nickel that have been and they have both north and south magnetic field permanent magnets magnetic moment two definitions moment the magnetic field permanent magnets can quite especially near the the magnetic field small straight magnet proportional the strength called its magnetic dipole moment the equations are trivial and also depend the distance from the magnet and the orientation the for simple points the direction line drawn from the south the north pole the flipping bar magnet equivalent rotating its degrees the magnetic field larger magnets can obtained modelling them collection large number small magnets called dipoles each having their own the magnetic field produced the magnet then the net magnetic field these and any net force the magnet result adding the forces the individual there are two competing models for the nature these these two models produce two different magnetic and outside though the two are identical multiplicative that many cases the distinction can this particularly true for magnetic such those due electric that are not generated magnetic magnetic pole model and the field sometimes useful model the force and torques between two magnets due magnetic poles repelling attracting each other the same manner the coulomb force between electric this called the gilbert model after william gilbert this magnetic field produced magnetic charges that are around each the therefore analogous the electric field which starts positive electric charge and ends negative electric near the north therefore all field lines point away from the north pole whether inside the magnet while near the south pole whether inside the magnet all field lines point toward the south north then feels force the direction the field while the force the south pole opposite the the magnetic pole the elementary magnetic dipole formed two opposite magnetic poles pole strength separated very small distance vector such that since based the fictitious idea magnetic charge the gilbert model has magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other electric charges but always come south magnetized object divided new pole will appear the surface each piece each will have pair complementary the magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that produced electric and only gives the correct magnetic field outside magnetic the magnetic field inside magnetic materials calculated from the model has the wrong amperian loop model and the field gauss law for magnetism after oersted discovered that electric currents produce magnetic field and ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar was natural hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due electric current this model developed the elementary magnetic dipole that makes all magnets sufficiently small amperian loop current the dipole moment this loop where the area the these magnetic dipoles produce magnetic one important property the field produced this way that magnetic field lines neither start nor end solenoidal vector field field line either extends infinity wraps around form closed date exception this rule has been see magnetic monopole below magnetic field lines exit magnet near its north pole and enter near its south but inside the magnet field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back the field line enters magnet somewhere has leave somewhere not allowed have end magnetic therefore always come and more since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that subtracting the field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically mathematically this equivalent where the integral surface integral over the closed surface closed surface one that completely surrounds region with holes let any field lines since points the dot product the integral positive for field pointing out and negative for field pointing there also corresponding differential form this equation covered maxwell equations below force between magnets force between magnets the force between two small magnets quite complicated and depends the strength and orientation both magnets and the distance and direction the magnets relative each the force particularly sensitive rotations the magnets due magnetic the force each magnet depends its magnetic moment and the magnetic field the understand the force between useful examine the magnetic pole model given this the field one magnet pushes and pulls both poles second this field the same both poles the second magnet then there net force that magnet since the force opposite for opposite however the magnetic field the first magnet nonuniform such the near one its each pole the second magnet sees different field and subject different this difference the two forces moves the magnet the direction increasing magnetic field and may also cause net this specific example general rule that magnets are attracted repulsed depending the orientation the into regions higher magnetic any uniform magnetic whether caused permanent magnets electric exerts force small magnet this the details the amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same that magnetic dipoles are repelled into regions higher magnetic mathematically the force small magnet having magnetic moment due magnetic field where the gradient the change the quantity per unit distance and the direction that maximum increase understand this note that the dot product where and represent the magnitude the and vectors and the angle between the same direction then the dot product positive and the gradient points pulling the magnet into regions higher field more strictly larger this equation strictly only valid for magnets zero but often good approximation for not too large the magnetic force larger magnets determined dividing them into smaller regions having their own then summing the forces each these magnetic torque permanent magnets magnetic torque two like poles two separate magnets are brought near each and one the magnets allowed promptly rotates align itself with the this the magnetic field the stationary magnet creates magnetic torque the magnet that free this magnetic torque tends align poles with the magnetic field therefore turns align itself with magnetic magnetic torque used drive electric motors one simple motor magnet fixed freely rotating shaft and subjected magnetic field from array electromagnets continuously switching the electric current through each the thereby flipping the polarity their magnetic like poles are kept next the the resultant torque transferred the see rotating magnetic fields below torque dipole the case for the force between the magnetic pole model leads more readily the correct here two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same also experience equal and opposite since these equal and opposite forces are different this produces torque proportional the distance perpendicular the between with the definition the pole strength times the distance between the this leads sin where constant called the vacuum permeability measuring and the angle between and the amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic here the field interacting with the amperian current loop through lorentz force described again the results are the same although the models are completely cross product sin mathematically the torque small magnet proportional both the applied magnetic field and the magnetic moment the where represents the vector cross product note that this equation includes all the qualitative information included there torque magnet the same direction the magnetic the cross product zero for two vectors that are the same further all other orientations feel torque that twists them toward the direction magnetic magnetic field and electric currents currents electric charges both generate magnetic field and feel force due magnetic magnetic field due moving charges and

different aspects the same phenomenon relativistic electromagnetism according the special theory relativity the partition the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components not but varies with the observational frame reference electric force perceived one observer may perceived another different frame magnetic mixture electric and magnetic formally special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into tensor called the electromagnetic tensor changing reference frames mixes these this analogous the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime and momentum and energy into four momentum magnetic vector potential magnetic potential advanced topics such quantum mechanics and relativity often easier work with potential formulation electrodynamics rather than terms the electric and magnetic this the vector potential and the scalar potential are defined such the vector potential may interpreted generalized potential momentum per unit charge just interpreted generalized potential energy per unit charge maxwell equations when expressed terms the potentials can cast into form that agrees with special relativity with little
