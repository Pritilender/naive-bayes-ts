electromagnetism aristotle attributed the first what could called scientific discussion magnetism thales miletus who lived from about about around the same ancient india the indian surgeon sushruta was the first make use the magnet for surgical there some evidence that the first use magnetic materials for its properties predates carlson suggests that the olmec might have used hematite magnet earlier than ancient china the earliest literary reference magnetism lies century book named after its the master demon valley the lodestone makes iron come attracts the earliest mention the

navigation employing the astronomical concept true north dream pool essays and the century the chinese were known use the lodestone compass for they sculpted directional spoon from lodestone such way that the handle the spoon always pointed alexander neckam was the first europe describe the compass and its use for peter peregrinus maricourt wrote the epistola magnete the first extant treatise describing the properties the properties magnets and the dry compass were discussed yemeni physicist astronomer and geographer william gilbert published his magneticisque magno magnete tellure the magnet and magnetic and the great magnet the earth this work describes many his experiments with his model earth called the terrella from his concluded that the earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north some believed that was the pole star polaris large magnetic island the north pole that attracted the understanding the relationship between electricity and magnetism began with work hans christian rsted professor the university who discovered more less accident that electric current could influence compass this landmark experiment known several other experiments with andr marie who discovered that the magnetic field circulating path was related the current flowing through the perimeter the carl friedrich gauss jean baptiste biot and lix savart

links between magnetism and james clerk maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into maxwell equations unifying magnetism and optics into the field electromagnetism einstein used these laws motivating his theory special relativity requiring that the laws held true all inertial reference frames electromagnetism has continued develop into the being incorporated into the more fundamental theories gauge theory quantum electrodynamics electroweak theory and finally the standard model sources magnetism magnetic moment its arises from two electric current see electron magnetic dipole moment nuclear magnetic moments atomic these moments are typically thousands times smaller than the magnetic they are negligible the context the magnetization nuclear magnetic moments are very important other particularly nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging ordinarily the enormous number electrons material are arranged such that their magnetic moments both orbital and cancel this some electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments result the pauli exclusion principle see electron configuration combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital both the electron arrangement exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each moreover even when the electron configuration such that there are unpaired electrons filled often the case that the various electrons the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point random that the material will not however sometimes either owing applied external magnetic each the electron magnetic moments will lined then the material can produce net total magnetic which can potentially quite the magnetic behavior material depends its particularly its electron configuration for the reasons mentioned and also the high random thermal motion makes more difficult for the electrons maintain topics diamagnetism diamagnetism diamagnetism appears all and the tendency material oppose applied magnetic and repelled magnetic however material with paramagnetic properties that with tendency enhance external magnetic the paramagnetic behavior thus despite its universal diamagnetic behavior observed only purely diamagnetic diamagnetic there are unpaired the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk these the magnetization arises from the orbital which can understood classically coulomb lorentz force centripetal force law note that this description meant only heuristic proper understanding requires quantum mechanical description note that all materials undergo this orbital however paramagnetic and ferromagnetic the diamagnetic effect overwhelmed the much stronger effects caused the unpaired paramagnetism paramagnetism paramagnetic material there are unpaired electrons atomic molecular orbitals with exactly one electron while paired electrons are required the pauli exclusion principle have their intrinsic magnetic moments pointing opposite causing their magnetic fields cancel unpaired electron free align its magnetic moment any when external magnetic field these magnetic moments will tend align themselves the same direction the applied thus reinforcing ferromagnetism ferromagnetism like paramagnetic has unpaired however addition the intrinsic magnetic tendency parallel applied field there also these materials tendency for these magnetic moments orient parallel each other maintain energy thus even the absence applied the magnetic moments the electrons the material spontaneously line parallel one every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual called the curie temperature curie above which loses its ferromagnetic this because the thermal tendency disorder overwhelms the lowering due ferromagnetic ferromagnetism only occurs few the common ones are iron nickel cobalt their alloys and some alloys rare earth metals magnetic domains magnetic domains the magnetic moment atoms ferromagnetic material cause them behave something like tiny permanent they stick together and align themselves into small regions more less uniform alignment called magnetic domains weiss domains magnetic domains can observed with magnetic force microscope reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines the there are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic when domain contains too many becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned opposite directions that they stick together more stably shown the when exposed magnetic the domain boundaries move that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure dotted yellow shown the when the magnetizing field the domains may not return unmagnetized this results the ferromagnetic being forming permanent when magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others result only one single the material magnetically saturated when magnetized ferromagnetic material heated the curie point temperature the molecules are agitated the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause when the material this domain alignment structure spontaneously manner roughly analogous how liquid can freeze into crystalline antiferromagnetism antiferromagnetism unlike there tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments neighboring valence electrons point opposite directions when all atoms are arranged substance that each neighbor the substance antiferromagnetic antiferromagnets have zero net magnetic meaning field produced antiferromagnets are less common compared the other types and are mostly observed low varying antiferromagnets can seen exhibit diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic some neighboring electrons want point opposite but there geometrical arrangement which each pair neighbors this called spin glass and example geometrical frustration ferrimagnetism ferrimagnetism like ferrimagnets retain their magnetization the absence however like neighboring pairs electron spins like point opposite these two properties are not because the optimal geometrical there more magnetic moment from the sublattice electrons that point one than from the sublattice that points the opposite most ferrites are the first discovered magnetic magnetite ferrite and was originally believed louis disproved however after discovering superparamagnetism superparamagnetism when ferromagnet ferrimagnet sufficiently acts like single magnetic spin that subject brownian motion its response magnetic field qualitatively similar the response but much electromagnet electromagnet type magnet whose magnetism produced the flow electric current the magnetic field disappears when the current other types magnetism molecular magnet metamagnetism based magnet spin glass electricity and special relativity classical electromagnetism and special relativity consequence theory special electricity and magnetism are fundamentally both magnetism lacking and electricity without are inconsistent with special due such effects length contraction time dilation and the fact that the magnetic force however when both electricity and magnetism are taken into the resulting theory fully consistent with special phenomenon that appears purely electric one observer may purely magnetic more generally the relative contributions electricity and magnetism are dependent the frame thus special relativity mixes electricity and magnetism into inseparable phenomenon called analogous how relativity mixes space and time into spacetime magnetic fields material magnetic field and inside and outside magnetic materials where the vacuum permeability the quantity called magnetic polarization the field the response the magnetization diamagnet paramagnet approximately the constant proportionality being called the magnetic hard magnet such not proportional the field and generally nonzero even when zero see remanence magnetic force magnetic field the phenomenon magnetism mediated the magnetic electric current magnetic dipole creates magnetic and that imparts magnetic forces other particles that are the maxwell which simplify the biot savart law the case steady describe the origin and behavior the fields that govern these therefore magnetism seen whenever electrically charged particles are motion for from movement electrons electric current certain cases from the orbital motion electrons around they also arise from intrinsic magnetic dipoles arising from mechanical spin the same situations that create magnetic charge moving current and intrinsic magnetic are also the situations which magnetic field has creating following the formula for moving for the forces intrinsic see magnetic when charged particle moves through magnetic field feels lorentz force given the cross product where velocity vector because this cross the force perpendicular both the motion the particle and the magnetic follows that the magnetic force does work the may change the direction the but cannot cause speed slow the magnitude the force where the angle between and one tool for determining the direction the velocity vector moving the magnetic and the force exerted labeling the index finger the middle finger and the thumb with your right when making like with the middle finger crossing under the index the fingers represent the velocity magnetic field and force respectively see also right hand rule magnetic dipoles magnetic dipole very common source magnetic field shown nature dipole with south pole and north pole terms dating back the use magnets interacting with the earth magnetic field indicate north and south the globe since opposite ends magnets are the north pole magnet attracted the south pole another the north magnetic pole currently the arctic north physically south attracts the north pole magnetic field contains energy and physical systems move toward configurations with lower when diamagnetic material placed magnetic magnetic dipole tends align itself opposed polarity that thereby lowering the net field when ferromagnetic material placed within magnetic the magnetic dipoles align the applied thus expanding the domain walls the magnetic magnetic monopoles magnetic monopole since bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the when bar magnet cut each the resulting pieces smaller bar even though magnet said have north pole and south these two poles cannot separated from each such thing would new and fundamentally different kind magnetic would act isolated north not attached south vice monopoles would carry magnetic analogous electric despite systematic searches since they have never been and could very well not nevertheless some theoretical physics models predict the existence these magnetic monopoles paul dirac observed that because electricity and magnetism show certain symmetry just quantum theory predicts that individual positive negative electric charges can observed without the opposing isolated south north magnetic poles should using quantum theory dirac showed that magnetic monopoles then one could explain the quantization electric that why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples the charge the certain grand unified theories predict the existence monopoles unlike elementary are solitons localized energy the initial results using these models estimate the number monopoles created the big bang contradicted cosmological the monopoles would have been plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion the however the idea inflation for which this problem served partial was successful solving this creating models which monopoles existed but were rare enough consistent with current quantum mechanical origin magnetism principle all kinds magnetism originate similar superconductivity from specific mechanical phenomena mathematical formulation quantum mechanics particular the chapters spin and the pauli principle successful model was developed already walter heitler and fritz london who derived how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen from the atomic hydrogen orbitals and centered the nuclei and see that this leads magnetism not all but will explained the according the london called body molecular orbitals are namely the resulting orbital here the last product means that first atomic orbital centered the second whereas the second electron runs around the first this exchange phenomenon expression for the mechanical property that particles with identical properties cannot specific not only for the formation chemical bonds but will also for this connection the term exchange interaction arises term which essential for the origin and which roughly factors and even than the energies arising from the electrodynamic dipole for the spin function which responsible for the have the already mentioned namely that symmetric orbital with the sign must multiplied with antisymmetric spin function with sign and vice versa thus not only and must substituted and respectively the first entity means spin the second one spin but also the sign the sign and finally the discrete values thereby have and the singlet state the sign means the spins are antiparallel for the solid have antiferromagnetism and for atomic molecules one has diamagnetism the tendency form chemical bond this the formation symmetric molecular with the sign results through the pauli principle automatically antisymmetric spin state with the sign the coulomb repulsion the the tendency that they try avoid each other this would lead antisymmetric orbital function with the sign these two and complementary symmetric spin function with the sign one the called triplet functions thus now the spins would parallel ferromagnetism paramagnetism atomic the mentioned tendency dominates the metals iron cobalt and nickel and some rare which are ferromagnetic most the other where the mentioned tendency are nonmagnetic sodium aluminium and magnesium antiferromagnetic manganese diatomic gases are also almost exclusively and not however the oxygen because the involvement exception important
