citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and april the simplest form ideal assumes that the fluid has little resistivity that can treated perfect conductor this the limit infinite magnetic reynolds number ideal lenz law dictates that the fluid sense tied the magnetic field ideal mhd small like volume fluid surrounding field line will continue lie along magnetic field even twisted and distorted fluid flows the the connection between magnetic field lines and fluid ideal mhd fixes the topology the magnetic field the for set magnetic field lines are tied into then they will remain long the plasma has negligible this difficulty reconnecting magnetic field lines makes possible store energy moving the fluid the source the magnetic the energy can then become available the conditions for ideal mhd break allowing magnetic reconnection that releases the stored energy from the magnetic ideal mhd equations the ideal mhd equations consist the continuity equation the cauchy momentum equation ampere law neglecting displacement and temperature evolution equation with any fluid description kinetic closure approximation must applied highest moment the particle distribution this often accomplished with approximations the heat flux through condition adiabaticity isothermality the the magnetic the electric the bulk plasma the current the mass the plasma and the continuity equation the momentum equation the lorentz force term can expanded give where the first term the right hand side the magnetic tension force and the second term the magnetic pressure force the ideal law for plasma given law the frequency law neglects displacement current and given the magnetic divergence constraint the energy equation given where the ratio specific heats for adiabatic equation this energy equation only applicable the absence shocks heat conduction assumes that the entropy fluid element does not applicability ideal mhd plasmas ideal mhd only strictly applicable the plasma strongly that the time scale collisions shorter than the other characteristic times the and the particle distributions are therefore close maxwellian the resistivity due these collisions the typical magnetic diffusion times over any scale length present the system must longer than any time scale interest length scales much longer than the ion skin depth and larmor radius perpendicular the long enough along the field ignore landau damping and time scales much longer than the ion gyration time system smooth and slowly importance resistivity imperfectly conducting fluid the magnetic field can generally move through the fluid following diffusion law with the resistivity the plasma serving diffusion constant this means that solutions the ideal mhd equations are only applicable for limited time for region given size before diffusion becomes too important one can estimate the diffusion time across solar active region from collisional hundreds thousands much longer than the actual lifetime would seem reasonable ignore the sized volume seawater has magnetic diffusion time measured even physical systems which are large and conductive enough that simple estimates the lundquist number suggest that can ignore the resistivity may still many instabilities exist that can increase the effective resistivity the plasma factors more than the enhanced resistivity usually the result the formation small scale structure like current sheets fine scale magnetic introducing small spatial scales into the system over which ideal mhd broken and magnetic diffusion can occur when this magnetic reconnection may occur the plasma release stored magnetic energy bulk mechanical acceleration particle acceleration and magnetic reconnection highly conductive systems important because concentrates energy time and that gentle forces applied plasma for long periods time can cause violent explosions and bursts when the fluid cannot considered completely but the other conditions for ideal mhd are possible use extended model called resistive this includes extra term law which models the collisional generally mhd computer simulations are least somewhat resistive because their computational grid introduces numerical resistivity importance kinetic effects another limitation mhd and fluid theories that they depend the assumption that the plasma strongly collisional this the first criterion listed that the time scale collisions shorter than the other characteristic times the and the particle distributions are maxwellian this usually not the case space and astrophysical when this not the are interested smaller spatial may necessary use kinetic model which properly accounts for the maxwellian shape the distribution however because mhd relatively simple and captures many the important properties plasma dynamics often qualitatively accurate and almost invariably the first model effects which are essentially kinetic and not captured fluid models include double layers landau damping wide range chemical separation space plasmas and electron structures mhd systems magnetosphere particle motion many mhd systems most the electric current compressed into thin dimensional ribbons termed current sheets these can divide the fluid into magnetic inside which the currents are relatively current sheets the solar corona are thought between few meters and few kilometers which quite thin compared the magnetic domains which are thousands hundreds thousands kilometers another example the magnetosphere where current sheets separate topologically distinct isolating most the ionosphere from the solar wind mhd waves waves plasmas waves plasmas the wave modes derived using mhd plasma theory are called magnetohydrodynamic waves mhd waves general there are three mhd wave pure alfv wave slow mhd wave fast mhd wave all these waves have constant phase velocities for all and hence there the limits when the angle between the wave propagation vector and magnetic field either degrees the wave modes are alfv wave magnetosonic wave the mhd oscillations will damped the fluid not perfectly conducting but has finite viscous effects are mhd waves and oscillations are popular tool for the remote diagnostics laboratory and astrophysical the corona the sun coronal seismology extensions magnetohydrodynamics resistive mhd resistive mhd describes magnetized fluids with finite electron diffusivity this diffusivity leads breaking the magnetic magnetic field lines can when they usually this term small and reconnections can handled thinking them not dissimilar shocks this process has been shown important the solar magnetic extended mhd extended mhd describes class phenomena plasmas that are higher order than resistive but which can adequately treated with single fluid these include the effects hall electron pressure finite larmor radii the particle and electron two fluid mhd two fluid mhd describes plasmas that include negligible hall electric field the electron and ion momenta must treated this description more closely tied equations evolution equation for the electric field hall mhd lighthill criticized the applicability ideal resistive mhd theory for concerned the neglect the hall current frequent simplification made magnetic fusion hall magnetohydrodynamics takes into account this electric field description the most important difference that the absence field line the magnetic field tied the electrons and not the bulk collisionless mhd mhd also often used for collisionless that case the mhd equations are derived from the vlasov equation applications geophysics beneath the mantle lies the which made two the solid inner core and liquid outer both have significant quantities the liquid outer core moves the presence the magnetic field and eddies are set into the same due the coriolis these eddies develop magnetic field which boosts original magnetic field process which sustaining and called the geomagnetic based the mhd glatzmaier and paul roberts have made supercomputer model the after running the simulations for thousands years virtual the changes magnetic field can the simulation results are good agreement with the observations the simulations have correctly predicted that the magnetic field flips every few hundred thousands during the the magnetic field vanish altogether just gets more earthquakes some monitoring stations have reported that earthquakes are sometimes preceded spike ulf remarkable example this occurred before the loma prieta earthquake california although subsequent study indicates that this was little more than sensor december geoscientists announced that the demeter satellite observed dramatic increase ulf radio waves over haiti the month before the magnitude earthquake researchers are attempting learn more about this correlation find out whether this method can used part early warning system for astrophysics and cosmology mhd applies quite well astrophysics and cosmology since over baryonic matter content the universe made including the interplanetary medium space between the the interstellar medium space between the the intergalactic nebulae and jets many astrophysical systems are not local thermal and therefore require additional kinematic treatment describe all the phenomena within the system see astrophysical plasma sunspots

shape assumed the extended magnetic field the previously theories describing the formation the sun and planets could not explain how the sun has the yet only the angular momentum the solar system closed system such the cloud gas and dust from which the sun was mass and angular momentum are both conserved that conservation would imply that the mass concentrated the center the cloud form the would spin much like skater pulling their arms the high speed rotation predicted early theories would have flung the sun apart before could have however magnetohydrodynamic effects transfer the
