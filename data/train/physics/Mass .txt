used calculate the for everyday objects and energies described newtonian physics mass describes the amount matter however very high speeds for subatomic special relativity shows that energy additional source thus any stationary body having mass has equivalent amount and all forms energy resist acceleration force and have gravitational there are several distinct phenomena which can used measure although some theorists have speculated some these phenomena could independent each current experiments have found difference among any the ways used measure inertial mass measures resistance changes velocity the acceleration active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force experienced object known gravitational mass energy measures the total amount energy contained within using the mass object determines its acceleration the presence applied this phenomenon called inertia according newton second law motion body

kilogram the kilogram grams which were first defined one cubic decimeter water the melting point then the kilogram was redefined the mass the international prototype kilogram and such independent the the properties january there are several proposals for redefining the kilogram yet including proposal for defining terms the planck constant other units are accepted for use the tonne metric equal the electronvolt unit energy but because the mass energy equivalence can easily converted unit and often used like this the mass has units the electronvolt common particle physics the atomic mass unit the mass carbon atom approximately note the atomic mass unit convenient for expressing the masses atoms and outside other units the slug imperial unit about similar the the pound unit both mass and used mainly the united about scientific contexts where pound and pound need units are usually used the planck mass the maximum mass point about used particle physics the solar mass defined the mass the sun primarily used astronomy compare large masses such stars the mass very small particle may identified with its inverse compton wavelength the mass very large star black hole may identified with its schwarzschild radius definitions mass the schwarzschild radius represents the ability mass cause curvature space and the standard gravitational parameter represents the ability massive body exert newtonian gravitational forces other inertial represents the newtonian response mass rest energy represents the ability mass converted into other forms the compton wavelength represents the quantum response mass local physical science one may distinguish conceptually between least seven different aspects mass seven physical notions that involve the concept mass every experiment date has shown these seven values proportional and some cases and this proportionality gives rise the abstract concept the amount matter certain types samples can exactly determined through electrodeposition clarification needed other precise processes the mass exact sample determined part the number and type atoms molecules and part the energy involved binding together which contributes negative missing mass inertial mass measure resistance changing its state motion when force determined applying force object and measuring the acceleration that results from that object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than object with large inertial mass when acted upon the same one says the body greater mass has greater inertia active gravitational mass note measure the strength gravitational flux gravitational flux equal the surface integral gravitational field over enclosing gravitational field can measured allowing small test freely fall and measuring its free fall acceleration for object fall near the moon will experience less gravitational and hence accelerate slower than the same object would were fall near the the gravitational field near the moon weaker because the moon has less active gravitational passive gravitational mass measure the strength interaction with gravitational field passive gravitational mass determined dividing weight its fall two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same however the object with smaller passive gravitational mass will experience smaller force less than the object with larger passive gravitational energy also has mass according the principle mass energy equivalence this equivalence exemplified large number physical processes including pair production nuclear fusion and the gravitational bending light pair production and nuclear fusion are processes through which measurable amounts mass and energy are converted into each the gravitational bending photons pure energy are shown exhibit behavior similar passive gravitational curvature spacetime relativistic manifestation the existence curvature extremely weak and difficult for this curvature was not discovered until after was predicted theory general extremely precise atomic clocks the surface the for are found measure less time run when compared similar clocks this difference elapsed time form curvature called gravitational time dilation other forms curvature have been measured using the gravity probe satellite quantum mass manifests itself difference between quantum frequency and its wave number the quantum mass the compton wavelength can determined through various forms spectroscopy and closely related the rydberg constant the bohr radius and the classical electron radius the quantum mass larger objects can directly measured using watt balance relativistic quantum mass one the irreducible representation labels the group weight mass mass versus weight everyday mass and weight are often used for weight may stated constant gravitational the weight object proportional its and unproblematic use the same unit for both but because slight differences the strength the earth gravitational field different the distinction becomes important for measurements with precision better than few and for places far from the surface the such space other conceptually mass measured kilograms refers intrinsic property whereas weight measured newtons measures resistance deviating from its natural course free fall which can influenced the nearby gravitational matter how strong the gravitational objects free fall are weightless though they still have the force known weight proportional mass and acceleration all situations where the mass accelerated away from free for when body rest gravitational field rather than free must accelerated force from scale the surface planetary body such the earth the moon this force keeps the object from going into free weight the opposing force such and thus determined the acceleration free the surface the for object with mass kilograms weighs newtons which means that newtons being applied keep the object from going into free the surface the the same object still has mass kilograms but weighs only because only newtons required keep this object from going into free fall the restated mathematical the surface the the weight object related its mass where the earth gravitational field expressed the acceleration experienced falling for other such when objects are subjected mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance planetary the weight force proportional the mass object multiplied the total acceleration away from free which called the proper acceleration through such objects vehicles centrifuges and the may experience weight forces many times those caused resistance the effects gravity resulting from planetary such the generalized equation for weight object related its mass the equation where the proper acceleration the object caused all influences other than gravity the only such occurs when object falls its weight will macroscopically mass associated with matter although unlike poorly defined the atomic not only fermions the particles often associated with but also some bosons the particles that act force carriers have rest mass another problem for easy definition that much the rest mass ordinary matter derives from the invariant mass contributed matter particles and kinetic energies which have rest mass themselves only the rest mass matter accounted for the rest mass its fermionic quarks and from fundamental physics mass the number describing under which the representation the little group the poincar group particle the standard model particle this symmetry described arising consequence coupling particles with rest mass postulated additional field known the higgs field the total mass the observable universe estimated between and corresponding the rest mass between and protons citation needed inertial gravitational mass although inertial passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between classical mechanics newton third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always identical least but the classical theory offers compelling reason why the gravitational mass has equal the inertial that does merely empirical albert einstein developed his general theory relativity starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and gravitational mass not that experiment will ever detect difference between them the weak version the equivalence principle however the resulting gravitation not force and thus not subject third the equality inertial and active gravitational mass remains puzzling the equivalence inertial and gravitational masses sometimes referred the galilean equivalence the weak equivalence principle the most important consequence this equivalence principle applies freely falling suppose have object with inertial and gravitational masses and respectively the only force acting the object comes from gravitational field combining second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration this says that the ratio gravitational inertial mass any object equal some constant and only all objects fall the same rate given gravitational this phenomenon referred the universality the constant can taken defining our units the first experiments demonstrating the universality fall were conducted galileo commonly stated that galileo obtained his results dropping objects from the leaning tower pisa but this most likely actually performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless inclined planes slow the motion and increase the timing increasingly precise experiments have been such those performed lor using the torsion balance pendulum deviation from and thus from galilean has ever been least the precision more precise experimental efforts are still being carried the universality fall only applies systems which gravity the only acting all other especially friction and air resistance must absent least for hammer and feather are dropped from the same height through the air the feather will take much longer reach the the feather not really free fall because the force air resistance upwards against the feather comparable the downward force the other the experiment performed vacuum which there air the hammer and the feather should hit the ground exactly the same time assuming the acceleration both objects towards each and the ground towards both for its own this can easily done high school laboratory dropping the objects transparent tubes that have the air removed with vacuum even more dramatic when done environment that naturally has david scott did the surface the moon during apollo stronger version the equivalence known the einstein equivalence principle the strong equivalence principle lies the heart the general theory relativity einstein equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions impossible distinguish between uniform acceleration and uniform gravitational thus the theory postulates that the force acting massive object caused gravitational field result the tendency move straight line other words its and should therefore function its inertial mass and the strength the gravitational origin mass mass generation mechanism theoretical physics mass generation mechanism theory which attempts explain the origin mass from the most fundamental laws physics number different models have been proposed which advocate different views the origin the problem complicated the fact that the notion mass strongly related the gravitational interaction but theory the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model particle physics known the standard model pre newtonian concepts weight amount weight balance scales papyrus hunefer dynasty anubis the concept amount very old and predates recorded history humans some early realized that the weight collection similar objects was directly proportional the number objects the where the weight the collection similar objects and the number objects the proportionality implies that two values have constant ratio early use this relationship balance scale which balances the force one weight against the force another the two sides balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational hence they have similar masses then their weights will also this allows the comparing also compare consequently historical weight standards were often defined terms the for used the carob seed carat siliqua measurement weight was equivalent carob seeds then the object was said weigh one roman the other the weight was equivalent carob seeds then the object was said weigh one roman ounce the roman pound and ounce were both defined terms different sized collections the same common mass the carob the ratio roman ounce carob roman pound carob was planetary motion kepler laws planetary motion johannes kepler sought employment with tycho brahe who had some the most precise astronomical data using precise observations the planet kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary johannes kepler published his three laws planetary explaining how the planets orbit the final planetary described planetary orbits following elliptical paths with the sun focal point the kepler discovered that the square the orbital period each planet directly proportional the cube the semi major axis its that the ratio these two values constant for all planets the solar system note august galileo galilei demonstrated his first telescope group venetian and early january galileo observed four dim objects near which mistook for however after few days galileo realized that these stars were fact orbiting these four objects later named the galilean moons honor their were the first celestial bodies observed orbit something other than the earth galileo continued observe these moons over the next eighteen and the middle had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their galilean free fall sometime prior galileo turned his attention the phenomenon objects free attempting characterize these galileo was not the first investigate gravitational nor was the first accurately describe its fundamental however galileo reliance scientific experimentation establish physical principles would have profound effect future generations unclear these were just hypothetical experiments used illustrate they were real experiments performed but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and biography pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls the same but different from the leaning tower pisa demonstrate that their time descent was independent their note support this galileo had advanced the following theoretical asked two bodies different masses and different rates fall are tied does the combined system fall faster because now more does the lighter body its slower fall hold back the heavier the only convincing resolution this question that all bodies must fall the same later experiment was described two new sciences published one fictional salviati describes experiment using bronze ball and wooden the wooden ramp was cubits half cubit wide and three breadths with smooth polished groove the groove was lined with parchment also smooth and polished and into this groove was placed smooth and very round bronze the ramp was inclined various angles slow the acceleration enough that the elapsed time could the ball was allowed roll known distance down the and the time taken for the ball move the known distance was the time was measured using water clock described galileo found that for object free the distance that the object has fallen always proportional the square the elapsed galileo had shown that objects free fall under the influence the gravitational field have constant and johannes had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence the gravitational however galileo free fall motions and planetary motions remained distinct during newtonian mass semi major axis sidereal orbital period sidereal year robert hooke had published his concept gravitational forces stating all lestial bodies have attraction gravitating power towards their own centers they also attract all the other lestial bodies that are within the sphere their further states that gravitational attraction increases how much the nearer the body wrought upon their own correspondence between robert hooke and isaac newton hooke conjectures that gravitational forces might decrease according the double the distance between the two hooke urged who was pioneer the development calculus work through the mathematical details keplerian orbits determine hypothesis was newton own investigations verified that hooke was but due personal differences between the two newton chose not reveal this isaac newton kept quiet about his discoveries until which time told edmond halley that had solved the problem gravitational but had misplaced the solution his after being encouraged newton decided develop his ideas about gravity and publish all his november isaac newton sent document edmund now lost but presumed have been titled motu corporum gyrum latin for the motion bodies halley presented findings the royal society with promise that fuller presentation would newton later recorded his ideas three book entitled philosophi naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles natural the first was received the royal society april the second march and the third april the royal society published entire collection their own expense may isaac newton had bridged the gap between gravitational mass and gravitational and proved the following where the apparent acceleration body passes through region space where gravitational fields the gravitational mass standard gravitational parameter the body causing gravitational and the radial coordinate the distance between the centers the two finding the exact relationship between gravitational mass and its gravitational newton provided second method for measuring gravitational the mass the earth can determined using method from the orbit can determined measuring the gravitational acceleration the and multiplying that the square the the mass the earth approximately three millionths the mass the other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been newton cannonball intermediate speeds high speeds cannonball cannonball was thought experiment used bridge the gap between gravitational acceleration and elliptical appeared book treatise the system the world according concept dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the however newton explains that when stone thrown horizontally meaning sideways perpendicular follows curved for stone projected the pressure its own weight forced out the rectilinear which the projection alone should have and made describe curve line the and through that crooked way last brought down the and the greater the velocity with which the farther goes before falls the newton further reasons that object were projected horizontal direction from the top high with sufficient would reach last quite beyond the circumference the and return the mountain from which was citation needed universal gravitational mass contrast earlier theories celestial spheres which stated that the heavens were made entirely different newton theory mass was groundbreaking partly because introduced universal gravitational mass every object has gravitational and every object generates gravitational newton further assumed that the strength each gravitational field would decrease according the square the distance that large collection small objects were formed into giant spherical body such the earth newton calculated the collection would create gravitational field proportional the total mass the and inversely proportional the square the distance the note for according theory universal each carob seed produces gravitational therefore one were gather immense number carob seeds and form them into enormous then the gravitational field the sphere would proportional the number carob seeds the hence should theoretically possible determine the exact number carob seeds that would required produce gravitational field similar that the earth unit conversion simple matter abstraction realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically used measure gravitational measuring gravitational mass terms traditional mass units simple but extremely difficult according theory all objects produce gravitational fields and theoretically possible collect immense number small objects and form them into enormous gravitating however from practical the gravitational fields small objects are extremely weak and difficult newton books universal gravitation were published the but the first successful measurement the mass terms traditional mass the cavendish experiment did not occur until over hundred years cavendish found that the density was times that the mass kilograms only known around five digits whereas its gravitational mass known over nine significant clarification needed given two objects and masses and separated distance newton law gravitation states that each object exerts gravitational force the magnitude where the universal gravitational constant the above statement may reformulated the following the magnitude given location gravitational then the gravitational force object with gravitational mass this the basis which masses are determined weighing simple spring scales for the force proportional the displacement the spring beneath the weighing per hooke law and the scales are calibrated take into allowing the mass read assuming the gravitational field equivalent both sides the balance measures relative giving the relative gravitation mass each inertial mass inertial mass the mass object measured its resistance the simple classical mechanics definition mass slightly different than the definition the theory special relativity but the essential meaning the classical according newton second law say that body has mass any instant obeys the equation motion where the resultant force acting the body and the acceleration the centre note for the will put aside the question what force acting the actually this equation illustrates how mass relates the inertia consider two objects with different apply identical force the object with bigger mass will experience smaller and the object with smaller mass will experience bigger might say that the larger mass exerts greater resistance changing its state motion response the however this notion applying identical forces different objects brings back the fact that have not really defined what force can sidestep this difficulty with the help newton third law which states that one object exerts force second will experience equal and opposite suppose have two objects constant inertial masses and isolate the two objects from all other physical that the only forces present are the force exerted which denote and the force exerted which denote newton second law states that where and are the accelerations and respectively suppose that these accelerations are that the forces between the two objects are this for the two objects are the process colliding with one newton third law then states that and thus the fraction which allows measure the inertial mass this our reference object and can define its mass then can measure the mass any other object the universe colliding with the reference object and measuring the additionally mass relates momentum its linear velocity and the kinetic energy its atomic mass john dalton new system chemical philosophy atomic theory the name atom comes from the ancient greek which means uncuttable something that cannot divided despite its early this philosophical assertion that matter composed discrete indivisible units remained very and was generally this changed the late when chemists uncovered increasing evidence for the existence law multiple proportions they noticed that when two more elements combined form the ingredients held fixed and definite for the mass ratio nitrogen oxygen nitric oxide seven and ammonia has hydrogen nitrogen mass ratio three order explain the existence these the chemist john dalton proposed that all matter was made tiny his first table relative atomic weights listed six hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon sulfur and phosphorus assigned hydrogen atomic weight the chemist william prout concluded that the hydrogen atom was fact the fundamental mass unit from which all other atomic masses were prout however was somewhat although elemental masses were multiples the hydrogen within about the discrepancies could not the light isotope for with single has atomic mass the most abundant isotope iron has protons and neutrons one might expect its atomic mass times that the hydrogen but its atomic mass only which clearly not integer multiple this iron has mass less than hydrogens note despite its the concepts such atomic mass and continue play influential role and the atomic mass unit continues the unit choice for very small mass mass relativity special relativity mass special relativity special relativity there are two kinds rest mass invariant note and relativistic mass which increases with rest mass the newtonian mass measured observer moving along with the relativistic mass the total quantity energy body system divided the two are related the following where the lorentz factor the invariant mass systems the same for observers all inertial while the relativistic mass depends the frame reference order formulate the equations physics such that mass values not change between convenient use rest the rest mass body also related its energy and the magnitude its momentum the relativistic momentum equation long the system closed with respect mass and both kinds mass are conserved any given frame the conservation mass holds even some types particles are converted matter particles may converted types energy which are not light kinetic and the potential energy electric and other but this does not affect the amount although things like heat may not all types energy still continue exhibit note thus mass and energy not change into one another rather both are names for the same and neither mass nor energy appear without the both rest and relativistic mass can expressed energy applying the known relationship yielding rest energy and relativistic total system respectively the relativistic mass and energy concepts are related their rest counterparts but they not have the same value their rest counterparts systems where there net because the relativistic mass proportional the energy has gradually fallen into disuse among there disagreement over whether the concept remains pedagogically bound the binding energy must often subtracted from the mass the unbound because binding energy commonly leaves the system the time mass not conserved this process because the system not closed during the binding for the binding energy atomic nuclei often lost the form gamma rays when the nuclei are leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles nucleons which they are general relativity mass general relativity general relativity the equivalence principle any several related concepts dealing with the equivalence gravitational and inertial mass the core this assertion albert
