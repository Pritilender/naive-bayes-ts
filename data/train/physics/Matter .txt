physics	matter navigation search matter three classical states plasma quartz solid water liquid nitrogen dioxide gas plasma globe plasma before the the term matter included ordinary matter composed and excluded other energy phenomena such light sound this concept matter may generalized from atoms include any objects having mass even when rest but this ambiguous because mass can arise from its constituents motion and interaction thus matter does not have universal definition nor fundamental physics today matter also used loosely general term for the substance that makes all observable physical objects the everyday objects that can bump into squeeze are composed atoms this atomic matter turn made interacting subatomic particles usually nucleus protons and neutrons and cloud orbiting electrons typically science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and massless particles such photons are not considered because they have neither rest mass nor however not all particles with rest mass have classical since fundamental particles such quarks and leptons sometimes equated with are considered point with effective size nevertheless quarks and leptons together make ordinary and their interactions contribute the effective volume the composite particles that make ordinary matter commonly exists four states phases solid liquid and gas and plasma however advances experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical such bose einstein condensates and fermionic condensates focus particle view matter also leads new phases such the quark gluon plasma for much the history the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature the idea that matter was built discrete building the called particulate theory matter was first put forward the greek philosophers leucippus and democritus matter should not confused with the two are not quite the same modern for mass conserved quantity which means that its value unchanging through within closed however matter not conserved such although this not obvious ordinary conditions where matter approximately still special relativity shows that matter may disappear conversion into even inside closed and can also created from within such however because mass like can neither created nor the quantity mass and the quantity energy remain the same during transformation matter which represents certain amount into material non energy this also true the reverse transformation energy into different fields science use the term matter and sometimes ways some these ways are based loose historical from time when there was reason distinguish mass and there single universally agreed scientific meaning the word scientifically the term mass but matter sometimes the field physics matter simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass that cannot travel the speed such quarks and however both physics and chemistry matter exhibits both wave like and particle like the called wave particle duality contents definition common definition relativity atoms definition protons neutrons and electrons definition quarks and leptons definition smaller building blocks issue structure quarks baryonic matter degenerate matter strange matter two meanings the term strange leptons phases antimatter other types dark matter dark energy exotic matter historical development origins early modernity late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries later developments summary see also references further reading external links definition common definition dna matter the common definition matter anything that has both mass and volume occupies space for car would said made occupies and has the observation that matter occupies space goes back however explanation for why matter occupies space and argued result the pauli exclusion principle two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter the occupation space are white dwarf stars and neutron discussed further relativity mass energy equivalence the context relativity mass not additive the sense that one can add the rest masses particles system get the total rest mass the thus relativity usually more general view that not the sum rest masses but the energy momentum tensor that quantifies the amount this tensor gives the rest mass for the entire matter therefore sometimes considered anything that contributes the momentum that anything that not purely this view commonly held fields that deal with general relativity such cosmology this light and other massless particles and fields are part the reason for this that this electromagnetic radiation such well the energy electromagnetic fields contributes the mass and therefore appears add matter for light radiation thermal radiation trapped inside box would contribute the mass the would any kind energy inside the including the kinetic energy particles held the nevertheless isolated individual particles light photons and the isolated kinetic energy massive are normally not considered matter citation needed difference between matter and mass therefore may seem arise when single particles are such the mass single photons for particles with rest such leptons and isolation the particle frame where not removes its kinetic citation needed source definition difficulty relativity arises from two definitions mass common one which formally equivalent total energy and thus observer and the other which referred rest mass invariant mass and independent the only the latter type mass loosely equated with matter since can however energies which contribute the first type mass may weighed also special such when trapped system with net momentum the box example thus photon with mass may add mass system which since such mass measured part ordinary matter complex the matter status massless becomes unclear such these problems contribute the lack rigorous definition matter although mass easier define the total energy above this also what weighed and what the source citation needed atoms definition definition matter based its physical and chemical structure matter made atoms deoxyribonucleic acid molecules are matter under this definition because they are made this definition can extend include charged atoms and include plasmas gases and electrolytes ionic which are not obviously included the atoms alternatively one can adopt the protons neutrons and electrons definition protons neutrons and electrons definition definition matter more scale than the atoms and molecules definition matter made what atoms and molecules are made meaning anything made positively charged protons neutral neutrons and negatively charged electrons this definition goes beyond atoms and however include substances made from these building blocks that are not simply atoms for example white dwarf matter carbon and oxygen nuclei sea degenerate microscopic the constituent particles matter such neutrons and electrons obey the laws quantum mechanics and exhibit particle even deeper protons and neutrons are made quarks and the force fields gluons that bind them together see quarks and leptons definition below quarks and leptons definition quarks leptons seen the above many early definitions what can called ordinary matter were based upon its structure building blocks the scale elementary definition that follows this tradition can stated ordinary matter everything that composed elementary fermions namely quarks and leptons the connection between these formulations leptons the most famous being the electron and quarks which baryons such protons and neutrons are combine form atoms which turn form molecules because atoms and molecules are said natural phrase the definition ordinary matter anything that made the same things that atoms and molecules are made notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that not atoms then because electrons are and and neutrons are made this definition turn leads the definition matter being quarks and leptons which are the two types elementary carithers and grannis ordinary matter composed entirely first generation particles namely the and quarks plus the electron and its higher generations particles quickly decay into generation and thus are not commonly this definition ordinary matter more subtle than first all the particles that make ordinary matter leptons and are elementary while all the force carriers are elementary the and bosons that mediate the weak force are not made quarks and are not ordinary even they have other mass not something that exclusive ordinary the lepton definition ordinary however identifies not only the elementary building blocks but also includes composites made from the constituents atoms and for such composites contain interaction energy that holds the constituents and may constitute the bulk the mass the great the mass atom simply the sum the masses its constituent neutrons and however digging the protons and neutrons are made quarks bound together gluon fields see dynamics quantum chromodynamics and these gluons fields contribute significantly the mass other most what composes the mass ordinary matter due the binding energy quarks within protons and for the sum the mass the three quarks nucleon approximately mev which low compared the mass nucleon approximately mev the bottom line that most the mass everyday objects comes from the interaction energy its elementary smaller building blocks issue the standard model groups matter particles into three where each generation consists two quarks and two the first generation the and down quarks the electron and the electron neutrino the second includes the charm and strange quarks the muon and the muon neutrino the third generation consists the top and bottom quarks and the tau and tau neutrino the most natural explanation for this would that quarks and leptons higher generations are excited states the first this turns out the would imply that quarks and leptons are composite particles rather than elementary particles structure particle fermions are particles that obey fermi dirac statistics fermions can like the like the proton and the standard model there are two types elementary quarks and which are discussed quarks quark quarks are particles spin implying that they are fermions they carry electric charge type type for electron has charge they also carry colour charge which the equivalent the electric charge for the strong interaction quarks also undergo radioactive decay meaning that they are subject the weak interaction quarks are massive and therefore are also subject gravity mev charm top down strange bottom baryonic matter baryon baryons are strongly interacting and are subject dirac amongst the baryons are the protons and which occur atomic but many other unstable baryons exist the term baryon usually refers particles made three exotic baryons made four quarks and one antiquark are known the but their existence not generally baryonic matter the part the universe that made baryons including all this part the universe does not include dark

the universe within range the best telescopes that matter that may visible because light could reach from made baryonic about dark and about dark pegasi degenerate matter degenerate matter degenerate matter refers the ground state gas fermions temperature near absolute the pauli exclusion principle requires that only two fermions can occupy quantum one and the other hence zero the fermions fill sufficient levels accommodate all the available and the case many the maximum kinetic energy called the fermi energy and the pressure the gas becomes very and depends the number fermions rather than the unlike normal states degenerate matter thought occur during the evolution heavy the demonstration subrahmanyan chandrasekhar that white dwarf stars have maximum allowed mass because the exclusion principle caused revolution the theory star degenerate matter includes the part the universe that made neutron stars and white strange matter strange matter strange matter particular form quark matter usually thought liquid down and strange quarks contrasted with nuclear matter which liquid neutrons and protons which themselves are built out and down and with strange quark which quark liquid that contains only and down high enough strange matter expected color superconducting strange matter hypothesized occur the core neutron stars more isolated droplets that may vary size from femtometers strangelets kilometers quark stars two meanings the term strange particle physics and astrophysics the term used two one broader and the other more the broader meaning just quark matter that contains three flavors down and this there critical pressure and associated critical and when nuclear matter made protons and neutrons compressed beyond this the protons and neutrons dissociate into yielding quark matter probably strange the narrower meaning quark matter that more stable than nuclear matter the idea that this could happen the strange matter bodmer and this the critical pressure the true ground state matter always quark the nuclei that see the matter around which are droplets nuclear are actually metastable and given enough time the right external would decay into droplets strange strangelets leptons lepton leptons are particles spin meaning that they are fermions they carry electric charge charged unlike leptons not carry colour charge meaning that they not experience the strong interaction leptons also undergo radioactive meaning that they are subject the weak interaction leptons are massive therefore are subject mev electron antielectron muon tau electron neutrino

matter can exist several different states known phases depending ambient pressure temperature and volume phase form matter that has relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties such density specific heat refractive index and these phases include the three familiar ones solids liquids and gases well more exotic states matter such plasmas superfluids supersolids bose einstein condensates fluid may gas there are also paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases magnetic materials conditions matter may change from one phase into these phenomena are called phase transitions and are studied the field thermodynamics the vastly increased ratio surface area volume results matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those bulk and not well described any bulk phase see nanomaterials for more phases are sometimes called states matter but this term can lead confusion with thermodynamic states for two gases maintained different pressures are different thermodynamic states different but the same phase both are antimatter antimatter list unsolved problems physics baryon asymmetry why there far more matter than antimatter the observable particle physics and quantum chemistry antimatter matter that composed the antiparticles those that constitute ordinary particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each the two annihilate that they may both converted

vanishingly small quantities the result radioactive decay lightning cosmic rays this because antimatter that came exist earth outside the confines suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that earth made and antiparticles and some stable antimatter such antihydrogen can made tiny but not enough quantity more than test few its theoretical there considerable speculation both science and science fiction why the observable universe apparently almost entirely and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter the early thought that matter and antimatter were equally and the disappearance antimatter requires asymmetry physical laws called the charge parity symmetry violation symmetry violation can obtained from the standard but this time the apparent

particle physics covers any material that violates one more classical conditions not made known baryonic particles such materials would possess qualities like negative mass being repelled rather than attracted historical development origins the pre socratics were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature the visible thales regarded water the fundamental material the anaximander posited that the basic material was wholly characterless the infinite apeiron anaximenes flourished posited that the basic stuff was pneuma heraclitus seems say the basic element though perhaps means that all empedocles spoke four elements which everything was earth water air and meanwhile parmenides argued that change does not and democritus argued that everything composed inert bodies all shapes called philosophy called atomism all these notions had deep philosophical aristotle was the first put the conception sound philosophical which did his natural especially physics book adopted reasonable suppositions the four empedoclean elements but added aether nevertheless these elements are not basic rather like everything else the visible are composed the basic principles matter and the word aristotle uses for hyle hule can literally translated wood that raw for indeed aristotle conception matter intrinsically linked something being made other contrast the early modern conception matter simply occupying matter for aristotle definitionally linked process matter what underlies change for horse eats the horse changes the grass into the grass such does not persist the but some aspect its the matter not specifically described atoms but consists whatever persists the change substance from grass matter this understanding does not exist independently substance but exists interdependently principle with form and only insofar underlies can helpful conceive the relationship matter and form very similar that between parts and for matter such can only receive actuality from has activity actuality similar the way that parts such only have their existence whole otherwise they would independent early modernity ren descartes originated the modern conception was primarily instead like deducing the existence matter from the physical reality descartes arbitrarily postulated matter mathematical substance that occupies extension breadth and constitutes the nature bodily and thought constitutes the nature thinking and everything else attributable body presupposes and only mode extended ren descartes principles philosophy for matter has only the property its only activity aside from locomotion exclude other this the mechanical philosophy descartes makes absolute distinction between which defines thinking and which defines extended they are independent aristotle defines matter and the forming principle complementary principles that together compose one independent thing substance aristotle defines matter roughly what things are actually made with potential independent but descartes elevates matter actual independent thing the continuity and difference between and conceptions both matter passive the respective conceptions matter has different relationships for matter and intelligence exist together interdependent whereas for matter and intelligence are definitionally independent substances descartes justification for restricting the inherent qualities matter extension its but his real criterion not permanence which equally applied color and but his desire use geometry explain all material like hobbes boyle and locke argued that the inherent properties bodies were limited and that called secondary like were only products human isaac newton inherited mechanical conception the third his rules reasoning newton lists the universal qualities matter hardness impenetrability mobility and similarly optics conjectures that god created matter massy hard impenetrable movable which were even very hard never wear break the primary properties matter were amenable mathematical unlike secondary qualities such color like newton rejected the essential nature secondary newton developed notion matter restoring matter intrinsic properties addition extension least limited such newton use gravitational which worked effectively repudiated mechanics which interactions happened exclusively though gravity would seem power newton himself did not admit essential property carrying the logic forward more joseph priestley argued that corporeal properties transcend contact chemical properties require the capacity for argued matter has other inherent powers besides the called primary qualities since there has been massive expansion knowledge the constituents the material world molecules atoms subatomic but there has been further development the definition rather the question has been set noam chomsky summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that what the concept body that finally the answer that there clear and definite conception rather the material world whatever discover with whatever properties must assumed have for the purposes explanatory any intelligible theory that offers genuine explanations and that can assimilated the core notions physics becomes part the theory the material part our account have such theory some seek assimilate the core notions perhaps modifying these notions carry out this noam language and problems the managua lectures matter whatever physics studies and the object study physics there independent general definition apart from its fitting into the methodology measurement and controlled the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains vague the demarcation problem delimiting science from everything late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the following the development the periodic table and atomic theory atoms were seen being the fundamental constituents atoms formed molecules and compounds the common definition terms occupying space and having mass contrast with most physical and chemical definitions which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related volume and the turn the nineteenth the knowledge matter began rapid aspects the newtonian view still held james clerk maxwell discussed matter his work matter and motion carefully separates matter from space and and defines terms the object referred newton first law motion however the newtonian picture was not the whole the the term matter was actively discussed host scientists and and brief outline can found further explanation needed textbook discussion from suggests matter what made three divisions matter are recognized masses molecules and mass matter any portion matter appreciable the molecule the smallest particle matter into which body can divided without losing its atom still smaller particle produced division rather than simply having the attributes mass and occupying matter was held have chemical and electrical the famous physicist thomson wrote about the constitution and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical later developments there entire literature concerning the structure ranging from the electrical the early the more recent quark structure introduced today with the understanding the quark structure matter has been one the most important advances contemporary further explanation needed this physicists speak matter fields and speak particles quantum excitations mode the matter and here quote from sabbata and with the word matter this the sources the that spinor fields like quarks and leptons which are believed the fundamental components scalar fields like the higgs particles which are used introduced mass gauge theory and however could composed more fundamental fermion further explanation needed the modern conception matter has been refined many times light the improvement knowledge just what the basic building blocks and how they the late century with the discovery the electron and the early with the discovery the atomic nucleus and the birth particle physics matter was seen made protons and neutrons interacting form today know that even protons and neutrons are not they can divided into quarks while electrons are part particle family called leptons both quarks and leptons are elementary particles and are currently seen being the fundamental constituents these quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces gravity electromagnetism weak interactions and strong interactions the standard model particle physics currently the best explanation for all but despite decades gravity cannot yet accounted for the quantum only described classical physics see quantum gravity and graviton interactions between quarks and leptons are the result exchange force carrying particles such photons between quarks and the carrying particles are not themselves building one mass and energy which cannot created cannot always related matter which can created out matter particles such even out pure such kinetic force carriers are usually not considered the carriers the electric force possess energy see planck relation and the carriers the weak force and bosons are but neither are considered matter however while these particles are not considered they contribute the total mass subatomic
