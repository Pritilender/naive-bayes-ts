are generated and altered each other and charges and currents they are named after the scottish physicist and mathematician james clerk maxwell who published early form those equations between and the equations have two major the microscopic set equations uses total charge and total including the complicated charges and currents materials the atomic scale has universal applicability but may unfeasible the macroscopic set equations defines two new auxiliary fields that describe scale behavior without having consider these atomic scale but requires the use parameters characterizing the

electric charges and electric currents which can expressed local densities namely charge density and current density separate law the lorentz force law describes how the electric and magnetic field act charged particles and version this law was included the original equations maxwell the magnetic field formulation there are four two them describe how the fields vary space due electric fields emanating from electric charges gauss law and magnetic fields closed field lines not due magnetic monopoles gauss law for magnetism the other two describe how the fields circulate around their respective the magnetic field circulates around electric currents and time varying electric fields amp law with addition while the electric field circulates around time varying magnetic fields faraday

since the surface taken can make the following transition see differentiation under the integral sign for more this conceptual descriptions gauss law gauss law describes the relationship between static electric field and the electric charges that cause the static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative the field line electric field lines begin only positive electric charges and end only negative electric the number field lines passing though closed surface therefore yields the total charge including bound charge due polarization enclosed that surface divided dielectricity free space the vacuum permittivity more relates the electric flux through any hypothetical closed gaussian surface the enclosed electric gauss law for magnetism law for magnetism gauss law for magnetism states that there are magnetic also called magnetic monopoles analogous electric instead the magnetic field due materials generated configuration called dipole magnetic dipoles are best represented loops current but resemble positive and negative magnetic inseparably bound having net magnetic terms field this equation states that magnetic field lines neither begin nor end but make loops extend infinity and other any magnetic field line that enters given volume must somewhere exit that equivalent technical statements are that the sum total magnetic flux through any gaussian surface that the magnetic field solenoidal vector field faraday law geomagnetic storm power grids the maxwell equation version faraday law describes how time varying magnetic field creates induces electric field this dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines just the magnetic not superposed static charge electric this aspect electromagnetic induction the operating principle behind many electric generators for rotating bar magnet creates changing magnetic which turn generates electric field nearby amp law with addition magnetic core memory law core bit law with addition states that magnetic fields can generated two electrical current this was the original and changing electric fields this was maxwell addition law particularly shows that not only does changing magnetic field induce electric but also changing electric field induces magnetic therefore these equations allow sustaining electromagnetic waves travel through empty space see electromagnetic wave equation the speed calculated for electromagnetic which could predicted from experiments charges and note exactly matches the speed light indeed light one form electromagnetic

speed light electromagnetic wave equation inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation sinusoidal wave solutions the electromagnetic wave equation sin sin region with charges and currents such maxwell equations reduce taking the curl the curl and using the curl the curl identity obtain the wave equations which identify with the speed light free materials with relative permittivity and relative permeability the phase velocity light becomes which usually less than and are mutually perpendicular each other and the direction wave and are phase with each sinusoidal plane wave one special

changing magnetic field through maxwell addition law this perpetual cycle allows these now known electromagnetic radiation move through space velocity microscopic versus macroscopic the microscopic variant equation expresses the electric field and the magnetic field terms the total charge and total current present including the charges and currents the atomic sometimes called the general form equations equations the macroscopic variant equation equally however with the difference being one macroscopic also known maxwell equations matter are more similar those that maxwell introduced integral differential law law for magnetism law induction circuital law unlike the microscopic equations the macroscopic equations separate out the bound charge and current obtain equations that depend only the free charges and currents this factorization can made splitting the total electric charge and current the cost this factorization that additional the displacement field and the magnetizing field are defined and need phenomenological constituent equations relate the additional fields the electric field and the magnetic often through simple linear for detailed description the differences between the microscopic total charge and current including material contributes note and macroscopic free charge and practical use variants see bound charge and current current density bound charge bound current right when electric field applied dielectric material its molecules respond forming microscopic electric dipoles their atomic nuclei move tiny distance the direction the while their electrons move tiny distance the opposite this produces macroscopic bound charge the material even though all the charges involved are bound individual for every molecule responds the similar that shown the these tiny movements charge combine produce layer positive bound charge one side the material and layer negative charge the other the bound charge most conveniently described terms the polarization the its dipole moment per unit macroscopic separation charge produced only the surfaces where enter and leave the for uniform charge also produced the somewhat all materials the constituent atoms exhibit magnetic moments that are intrinsically linked the angular momentum the components the most notably their electrons the connection angular momentum suggests the picture assembly microscopic current outside the assembly such microscopic current loops not different from macroscopic current circulating around the despite the fact that individual charge traveling large these bound currents can described using the magnetization the very complicated and granular bound charges and bound therefore can represented the macroscopic scale terms and which average these charges and currents sufficiently large scale not see the granularity individual but also sufficiently small that they vary with location the the maxwell macroscopic equations ignores many details fine scale that can unimportant understanding matters gross scale calculating fields that are averaged over some suitable auxiliary polarization and magnetization the definitions not constitutive the auxiliary fields where the polarization field and the magnetization field which are defined terms microscopic bound charges and bound current the macroscopic bound charge density and bound current density terms polarization and magnetization are then defined define the bound and total charge and current density and use the defining relations above eliminate and the macroscopic maxwell equations reproduce the microscopic equations constitutive relations constitutive equation electromagnetism order apply macroscopic necessary specify the relations between displacement field and the electric field well the magnetizing field and the magnetic field equivalently have specify the dependence the polarisation hence the bound and the magnetisation hence the bound the applied electric and magnetic the equations specifying this response are called constitutive relations for world the constitutive relations are rarely except and usually determined see the main article constitutive relations for fuller for materials without polarisation and magnetisation vacuum the constitutive relations are for scalar constants and since there bound the total and the free charge and current are more for linear materials the constitutive relations are where the permittivity and the permeability the even the linear case can have various however for homogeneous and are constant throughout the while for inhomogeneous materials they depend location within the material and perhaps for isotropic and are while for anisotropic materials due crystal they are tensors materials are generally dispersive and depend the frequency any incident even more the case linear materials see for example nonlinear optics and are not necessarily proportional similarly not necessarily proportional general and depend both and location and and possibly other physical applications one also has describe how the free currents and charge density behave terms and possibly coupled other physical quantities like and the number and velocity carrying the original equations given maxwell see history equations included ohms law the form equations gaussian units gaussian units gaussian units are popular system that part the centimetre second system units when using cgs units conventional use slightly different definition electric field this implies that the modified electric and magnetic field have the same units the convention this not the for waves making dimensional analysis the equations then uses unit charge defined such way that the permittivity the vacuum hence using these different the maxwell equations gauss law law for magnetism law induction law alternative formulations mathematical descriptions the electromagnetic field special relativity classical electromagnetism

other ways write the microscopic showing they can formulated using different points view and mathematical formalisms that describe the same often they are also called the maxwell the direct time formulations make manifest that the maxwell equations are relativistically invariant fact studying the hidden symmetry the vector calculus formulation was major source inspiration for relativity the

invariant the operator the beltrami operator forms arbitrary lorentzian time other formulations include the geometric algebra formulation and matrix representation equations historically quaternionic formulation was solutions maxwell equations are partial differential equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields each other and the electric charges and often the charges and currents are themselves dependent the electric and magnetic fields via the lorentz force equation and the constitutive relations these all form set coupled partial differential which are often very difficult the solutions these equations encompass all the diverse phenomena the entire field classical electromagnetism thorough discussion far beyond the scope the but some general notes like any differential boundary conditions and initial conditions are necessary for unique for even with charges and currents anywhere many solutions equations are not just the obvious solution another solution constant constant while yet other solutions have electromagnetic waves filling some maxwell equations are solved through infinite and boundary conditions are given asymptotic limits other maxwell equations are solved just finite region with appropriate boundary conditions that for the boundary could artificial absorbing boundary representing the rest the periodic boundary conditions with waveguide cavity resonator the boundary conditions may describe the walls that isolate small region from the outside jefimenko equations the closely related wiechert potentials are the explicit solution equations for the electric and magnetic fields created any given distribution charges and assumes specific initial conditions obtain the called retarded where the only fields present are the ones created the jefimenko equations are not helpful situations when the charges and currents are themselves affected the fields they numerical methods for differential equations can used approximately solve equations when exact solution these methods usually require and include the finite element method and finite difference domain method for more see computational electromagnetics maxwell equations seem overdetermined that they involve six unknowns the three components and but eight equations one for each the two three vector components each for and the currents and charges are not being freely specifiable subject charge conservation this related certain limited kind redundancy can proven that any system satisfying law and law automatically also satisfies the two long the initial condition although possible simply ignore the two laws numerical algorithm apart from the initial the imperfect precision the calculations can lead increasing violations those introducing dummy variables characterizing these the four equations become not overdetermined after the resulting formulation can lead more accurate algorithms that take all four laws into limitations for theory electromagnetism while equations along with the rest classical are extraordinarily successful explaining and predicting variety they are not but some special they can noticeably examples include extremely strong fields see euler heisenberg lagrangian and extremely short distances see vacuum polarization moreover various phenomena occur the world even though equations predict them such nonclassical light and quantum entanglement electromagnetic fields see quantum optics finally any phenomenon involving individual photons such the photoelectric effect planck law the duane hunt law single photon light detectors etc would difficult impossible explain equations were exactly equations not involve for the most accurate predictions all maxwell equations have been superseded quantum electrodynamics
