physics	molecule navigation search molecules terpenoid molecule electrically neutral group two more atoms held together chemical bonds molecules are distinguished from ions their lack electrical however quantum physics organic chemistry and biochemistry the term molecule often used less also being applied polyatomic ions the kinetic theory gases the term molecule often used for any gaseous particle regardless its according this noble gas atoms are considered molecules despite being composed single bonded molecule may homonuclear that consists atoms single chemical element with oxygen may chemical compound composed more than one element with water atoms and complexes connected non covalent bonds such hydrogen bonds ionic bonds are generally not considered single molecules components matter are common organic substances and therefore they also make most the oceans and however the majority familiar solid substances including most the minerals that make the crust mantle and core the earth contain many chemical but are not made identifiable also typical molecule can defined for ionic crystals salts and covalent crystals network solids although these are often composed repeating unit cells that extend either plane such graphene dimensionally such diamond quartz sodium chloride the theme repeated structure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding which means that solid metals are also not made glasses solids that exist vitreous disordered atoms may also held together chemical bonds without presence any definable but also without any the regularity repeating units that characterises contents molecular science history and etymology molecular size smallest molecule diameter largest molecule diameter radius molecular formula molecular geometry molecular spectroscopy theoretical aspects see also references external links molecular science the science molecules called molecular chemistry molecular physics depending whether the focus chemistry molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results the formation and breakage chemical bonds while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and however this distinction molecular molecule consists stable system bound state composed two more atoms polyatomic ions may sometimes usefully thought electrically charged the term unstable molecule used for very reactive species short lived assemblies resonances electrons and nuclei such radicals molecular ions rydberg molecules transition states van der waals complexes systems colliding atoms bose einstein condensate history and etymology history molecular theory according merriam webster and the online etymology dictionary the word molecule derives from the latin moles small unit molecule extremely minute from mol cule citation needed from modern molecula diminutive latin moles barrier vague meaning the vogue for the word used until late century only latin can traced the philosophy descartes the definition the molecule has evolved knowledge the structure molecules has earlier definitions were less defining molecules the smallest particles pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical this definition often breaks down since many substances ordinary such rocks salts and metals are composed large crystalline networks chemically bonded atoms ions but are not made discrete molecular size most molecules are far too small seen with the naked but there are dna macromolecule can reach macroscopic sizes can molecules many polymers molecules commonly used building blocks for organic synthesis have dimension few angstroms several dozen single molecules cannot usually observed light noted but small molecules and even the outlines individual atoms may traced some circumstances use atomic force microscope some the largest molecules are macromolecules supermolecules smallest molecule diameter the smallest molecule the diatomic hydrogen with bond length largest molecule diameter mesoporous silica have been produced with diameter radius effective molecular radius the size molecule displays the table permselectivity for different substances contains molecular formula this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed january empirical formula the simplest integer ratio the chemical elements that constitute for water always composed ratio hydrogen oxygen atoms and ethyl alcohol ethanol always composed carbon hydrogen and oxygen ratio however this does not determine the kind molecule uniquely dimethyl ether has the same ratios for molecules with the same atoms different arrangements are called isomers also for have the same ratio oxygen and thus the same empirical but different total numbers atoms the the molecular formula reflects the exact number atoms that compose the molecule and characterizes different however different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different the empirical formula often the same the molecular formula but not for the molecule acetylene has molecular formula but the simplest integer ratio elements the molecular mass can calculated from the chemical formula and expressed conventional atomic mass units equal the mass neutral isotope atom for network solids the term formula unit used stoichiometric calculations molecular geometry molecular geometry molecules have fixed equilibrium geometries bond lengths and about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational pure substance composed molecules with the same average geometrical the chemical formula and the structure molecule are the two important factors that determine its particularly its reactivity isomers share chemical formula but normally have very different properties because their different stereoisomers particular type may have very similar chemical properties and the same time different biochemical activities molecular spectroscopy spectroscopy molecular spectroscopy deals with the response spectrum molecules interacting with probing signals known energy frequency according planck formula molecules have quantized energy levels that can analyzed detecting the energy exchange through absorbance emission spectroscopy does not generally refer diffraction studies where particles such neutrons electrons high energy rays interact with regular arrangement molecules theoretical aspects the study molecules molecular physics and theoretical chemistry largely based quantum mechanics and essential for the understanding the chemical bond the simplest molecules the hydrogen ion and the simplest all the chemical bonds the one electron bond composed two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron which means that the schr dinger equation for the system can solved more easily due the lack electron with the development fast digital approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one the main aspects computational chemistry when trying define rigorously whether arrangement atoms sufficiently considered iupac suggests that must correspond depression the potential energy surface that deep enough confine least one vibrational this definition does not depend the nature the interaction between the but only the strength the includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally considered such the helium dimer which has one vibrational bound state and loosely bound that only likely observed very low whether not arrangement atoms sufficiently considered molecule inherently operational philosophically therefore molecule not fundamental
