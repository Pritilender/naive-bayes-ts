nobel prize physics when the third type lepton the tau was discovered the stanford linear accelerator center too was expected have associated neutrino the tau first evidence for this third neutrino type came from the observation missing energy and momentum tau decays analogous the beta decay leading the discovery the the first detection tau neutrino interactions was announced summer the donut collaboration fermilab its existence had already been inferred both theoretical consistency and experimental data from the large positron collider citation needed solar neutrino problem solar neutrino problem starting the late several experiments found that the number electron neutrinos arriving from the sun was between one third and one half the number predicted the standard solar model this which became known the solar neutrino problem remained unresolved for some thirty was resolved discovery neutrino oscillation and the standard model particle physics had assumed that neutrinos are massless and cannot change flavor however neutrinos had they could change oscillate between citation needed oscillation practical method for investigating neutrino oscillations was first suggested bruno pontecorvo using analogy with kaon oscillations over the subsequent years developed the mathematical formalism and the modern formulation vacuum stanislav mikheyev and alexei smirnov expanding work lincoln wolfenstein noted that flavor oscillations can modified when neutrinos propagate through this called mikheyev wolfenstein effect msw important understand because many neutrinos emitted fusion the sun pass through the dense matter the solar core where essentially all solar fusion takes their way detectors starting experiments began show that solar and atmospheric neutrinos change flavors see super kamiokande and sudbury neutrino observatory this resolved the solar neutrino the electron neutrinos produced the sun had partly changed into other flavors which the experiments could not although individual such the set solar neutrino are consistent with oscillatory mechanisms neutrino flavor taken neutrino experiments imply the existence neutrino especially relevant this context are the reactor experiment kamland and the accelerator experiments such minos the kamland experiment has indeed identified oscillations the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved the solar electron similarly minos confirms the oscillation atmospheric neutrinos and gives better determination the mass squared supernova neutrinos supernova early warning system raymond and masatoshi koshiba were jointly awarded the nobel prize physics davis for his pioneer work cosmic neutrinos and koshiba for the first real time observation supernova neutrinos the detection solar neutrinos and neutrinos the supernova marked the beginning neutrino astronomy citation needed properties and reactions the neutrino has integer spin and therefore fermion neutrinos interact primarily through the weak force the discovery neutrino flavor oscillations implies that neutrinos have the existence neutrino mass strongly suggests the existence tiny neutrino magnetic moment the order allowing the possibility that neutrinos may interact electromagnetically experiment done columbia university showed that neutrinos always have handed chirality very hard uniquely identify neutrino interactions among the natural background for this early experiments special reaction channel was chosen facilitate the the interaction antineutrino with one the hydrogen nuclei the water hydrogen nucleus single simultaneous nuclear which would occur within heavier don need considered for the detection within cubic metre water placed right outside nuclear only relatively few such interactions can but the setup now used for measuring the plutonium production mikheyev wolfenstein effect mikheyev wolfenstein effect neutrinos traveling through undergo process analogous light traveling through transparent material this process not directly observable because does not produce ionizing radiation but gives rise the msw effect only small fraction the energy transferred the nuclear reactions neutrinos can interact with changing another this process used radiochemical neutrino detectors this the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have taken into account estimate the probability for general the interaction probability increases with the number neutrons and protons within induced fission very much like neutrons nuclear reactors neutrinos can induce fission reactions within heavy nuclei this reaction has not been measured but predicted happen within stars and the process affects the abundance isotopes seen the universe neutrino fission deuterium nuclei has been observed the sudbury neutrino observatory which uses heavy water detector types there are three known types flavors electron neutrino muon neutrino and tau neutrino named after their partner leptons the standard model see table the current best measurement the number neutrino types comes from observing the decay the boson this particle can decay into any light neutrino and its and the more types light neutrinos available the shorter the lifetime the measurements the lifetime have shown that the number light neutrino types the correspondence between the six quarks the standard model and the six among them the three suggests intuition that there should exactly three types however actual proof that there are only three kinds neutrinos remains elusive goal particle the possibility sterile neutrinos relatively light neutrinos which not participate the weak interaction but which could created through flavor oscillation see unaffected these based and the existence such particles fact hinted experimental data from the lsnd experiment however the currently running miniboone experiment until that sterile neutrinos are not required explain the experimental although the latest research into this area going and anomalies the miniboone data may allow for exotic neutrino including sterile recent analysis reference electron spectra data from the institut langevin has also hinted sterile recently analyzed data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe the cosmic background radiation compatible with either three four types hoped that the addition two more years data from the probe will resolve this

cern rhic paul dirac carl david anderson andrei sakharov antineutrinos are the antiparticles which are neutral particles produced nuclear beta decay these are emitted during beta particle emissions when neutron turns into they have spin and are part the lepton family the antineutrinos observed far all have handed helicity only one the two possible spin states has ever been while the neutrinos are antineutrinos like interact with other matter only through the gravitational and weak forces making them very difficult detect neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that antineutrinos have mass but beta decay experiments constrain that mass very antineutrino interaction has been suggested attempts form composite photon with the neutrino theory light because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles possible that they are actually the same particles which have this property are known majorana particles neutrinos are indeed majorana particles then the neutrinoless double beta decay well range other lepton number violating are several experiments have been proposed search for this researchers around the world have begun investigate the possibility using antineutrinos for reactor monitoring the context preventing the proliferation nuclear weapons antineutrinos were first detected result their interaction with protons large tank this was installed next nuclear reactor controllable source the cowan reines neutrino experiment flavor oscillations neutrino oscillation neutrinos are most often created detected with well defined flavor muon tau however phenomenon known neutrino flavor neutrinos are able oscillate among the three available flavors while they propagate through specifically this occurs because the neutrino flavor eigenstates are not the same the neutrino mass eigenstates simply called this allows for neutrino that was produced electron neutrino given location have calculable probability detected either muon tau neutrino after has traveled another this quantum mechanical effect was first hinted the discrepancy between the number electron neutrinos detected from the sun core failing match the expected dubbed the solar neutrino problem the standard model the existence flavor oscillations implies nonzero differences between the neutrino because the amount mixing between neutrino flavors given time depends the differences between their squared there are other possibilities which neutrino can oscillate even they are lorentz invariance not exact neutrinos can experience lorentz violating oscillations possible that the neutrino and antineutrino are fact the same hypothesis first proposed the italian physicist ettore majorana the neutrino could transform into antineutrino and vice flipping the orientation its spin state this change spin would require the neutrino and antineutrino have nonzero and therefore travel slower than because such spin caused only change point can take place only inertial frames reference exist that move faster than the such particle has spin one orientation when seen from frame which moves slower than the but the opposite spin when observed from frame that moves faster than the july the results from the experiment presented the european physical society conference high energy physics sweden confirmed the neutrino oscillation speed measurements neutrino speed before neutrinos were found they were generally assumed propagating the speed light according the theory special relativity the question neutrino velocity closely related their mass neutrinos are they must travel the speed however they have they cannot reach the speed also some lorentz violating variants quantum gravity might allow light comprehensive framework for lorentz violations the standard model extension the early first measurements neutrino speed were done using pulsed pion beams produced pulsed proton beams hitting the pions decayed producing and the neutrino interactions observed within time window detector distance were consistent with the speed this measurement was repeated using the minos detectors which found the speed gev neutrinos confidence and confidence level range between and the central value higher than the speed light and consistent with superluminal however the uncertainty great enough that the result also does not rule out speeds less than equal light this high confidence this measurement set upper bound the mass the muon neutrino mev confidence after the detectors for the project were upgraded minos corrected their initial result and found agreement with the speed with limits for the difference the arrival time light and neutrinos nanoseconds further measurements are going the same observation was somewhat larger with supernova mev antineutrinos from the supernova were detected within time window that was consistent with speed light for the the question neutrino masses cannot decided based measurements the neutrino september the opera collaboration released calculations showing velocities gev and gev neutrinos exceeding the speed light their experiments see faster light neutrino anomaly november opera repeated its experiment with changes that the speed could determined individually for each detected the results showed the same light however february reports came out that the results may have been caused loose fiber optic cable attached one the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times the independent recreation the experiment the same laboratory icarus found discernible difference between the speed neutrino and the speed june cern announced that new measurements conducted four gran sasso experiments icarus borexino and lvd found agreement between the speed light and the speed finally refuting the initial opera mass list unsolved problems physics can measure the neutrino neutrinos follow dirac majorana statistics the standard model particle physics assumed that neutrinos are however the experimentally established phenomenon neutrino which mixes neutrino flavour states with neutrino mass states analogously ckm mixing requires neutrinos have nonzero massive neutrinos were originally conceived bruno pontecorvo the enhancing the basic framework accommodate their mass straightforward adding right handed lagrangian this can done two like other fundamental standard model mass generated the dirac mechanism then the framework would require singlet this particle would have other standard model interactions apart from the yukawa interactions with the neutral component the higgs doublet called sterile mass can generated the majorana mechanism which would require the neutrino and antineutrino the same the strongest upper limit the masses neutrinos comes from cosmology the big bang model predicts that there fixed ratio between the number neutrinos and the number photons the cosmic microwave background the total energy all three types neutrinos exceeded average per there would much mass the universe that would citation needed this limit can circumvented assuming that the neutrino however there are limits within the standard model that make this much more stringent constraint comes from careful analysis cosmological such the cosmic microwave background galaxy surveys and the lyman alpha forest these indicate that the summed masses the three neutrinos must less than research results the super kamiokande neutrino detector determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor which requires that they must have nonzero while this shows that neutrinos have the absolute neutrino mass scale still not this because neutrino oscillations are sensitive only the difference the squares the the best estimate the difference the squares the masses mass eigenstates and was published kamland the minos experiment measured oscillations from intense muon neutrino determining the difference the squares the masses between neutrino mass eigenstates and the initial results indicate consistent with previous results from since the difference two squared least one them has have value which least the square root this thus there exists least one neutrino mass eigenstate with mass least lensing data galaxy cluster were analyzed predict neutrino mass about all neutrino masses are then nearly with neutrino oscillations order they lie below the troitsk upper bound for the electron the latter will tested the katrin experiment that searches for mass between and number efforts are under way directly determine the absolute neutrino mass scale laboratory the methods applied involve nuclear beta decay katrin and mare neutrinoless double beta decay gerda cuore cuoricino nemo and may opera researchers observed the first tau neutrino candidate event muon neutrino beam the first time transformation neutrinos had been giving evidence that they have july the megaz galaxy survey reported that they had measured limit the combined mass the three neutrino varieties less than tighter upper bound yet for this sum was reported march the planck collaboration whereas february result estimates the sum based discrepancies between the cosmological consequences implied detailed measurements the cosmic microwave background and predictions arising from observing other combined with the assumption that neutrinos are responsible for the observed weaker gravitational lensing than would expected from massless the neutrino majorana particle the mass can calculated finding the half life neutrinoless beta decay certain the lowest upper the majorana mass the has been set exo mev size standard model neutrinos are fundamental like they have zero effective size can defined using their electroweak radius apparent size electroweak interaction the average electroweak characteristic size nanobarn where for electron for muon neutrino and for tau depends other properties than however this best understood being relevant only probability since the neutrino does not interact and defined quantum mechanically wavefunction instead single point does not have size the same sense everyday furthermore processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies them that they travel almost the speed nevertheless neutrinos are and thus obey the pauli exclusion principle principle they are solid objects that cannot packed into arbitrary chirality experimental results show that all produced and observed neutrinos have handed helicities spins antiparallel momenta and all antineutrinos have handed within the margin the massless means that only one two possible chiralities observed for either these are the only chiralities included the standard model particle possible that their counterparts handed neutrinos and handed simply not they their properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and theorized that they are either very heavy the order gut scale see seesaw mechanism not participate weak interaction called sterile neutrinos the existence nonzero neutrino masses somewhat complicates the neutrinos are produced weak interactions chirality however chirality massive particle not constant helicity but the chirality operator does not share eigenstates with the helicity free neutrinos propagate mixtures and handed helicity with mixing amplitudes the order this does not significantly affect the because neutrinos involved are nearly always and thus mixing amplitudes are vanishingly for most solar neutrinos have energies the order kev mev the fraction neutrinos with wrong helicity among them cannot exceed sources artificial reactor neutrinos nuclear reactors are the major source generated antineutrinos are made the decay rich daughter fragments the fission generally the four main isotopes contributing the antineutrino flux are and via the antineutrinos emitted during beta minus decay their respective fission the average nuclear fission releases about mev which roughly about mev radiated away for typical nuclear reactor with thermal power meaning that the core produces this much and electrical power generation the total power production from fissioning atoms actually which radiated away antineutrino radiation and never appears the this fission energy lost from this reactor and does not appear heat available run since the antineutrinos penetrate all building materials essentially without any and the antineutrino energy spectrum depends the degree which the fuel burned fission antineutrinos average have slightly more energy than those from fission but the detectable antineutrinos from fission have peak energy between about and mev with maximum energy about mev there established experimental method measure the flux low energy only antineutrinos with energy above threshold mev can uniquely identified see neutrino detection below estimated all antineutrinos from nuclear reactor carry energy above this thus average nuclear power plant may generate over antineutrinos per second above this but also much larger number times this below the energy which cannot seen with present detector accelerator neutrinos some particle accelerators have been used make neutrino the technique smash protons into fixed producing charged pions kaons these unstable particles are then magnetically focused into long tunnel where they decay while because the relativistic boost the decaying particle the neutrinos are produced beam rather than efforts construct accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through muon decays are such setup generally known neutrino factory nuclear bombs nuclear bombs also produce very large quantities fred reines and clyde cowan considered the detection neutrinos from bomb prior their search for reactor fission reactor was recommended better alternative los alamos physics division leader kellogg fission bombs produce antineutrinos from the fission and fusion bombs produce both neutrinos from the fusion and antineutrinos from the initiating fission geologic geoneutrino neutrinos are part the natural background radiation the decay chains and isotopes well include beta decays which emit these called geoneutrinos can provide valuable information the first indication for geoneutrinos was found the kamland experiment kamland main background the geoneutrino measurement are the antineutrinos coming from several future experiments aim improving the geoneutrino measurement and these will necessarily have far away from proton proton chain atmospheric atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction cosmic rays with atomic nuclei the earth

thermal respectively while the based baksan detector found neutrinos lepton number either thermal capture burst lasting less than seconds the neutrino signal from the supernova arrived earth several hours before the arrival the first electromagnetic expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock the exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos pass through the churning mass the exploding while the electromagnetic photons were because neutrinos interact little with thought that neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions the much the visible light comes from the decay radioactive elements produced the supernova shock and even light from the explosion itself scattered dense and turbulent neutrinos the other pass through these providing information about the supernova core where the densities were large enough influence the neutrino furthermore the neutrino burst expected reach earth before any electromagnetic including visible gamma rays radio the exact time delay depends the velocity the shock wave and the thickness the outer layer the for type astronomers expect the neutrino flood released seconds after the stellar core while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours the snews project uses network neutrino detectors monitor the sky for candidate supernova the neutrino signal will provide useful advance warning star exploding the milky supernova remnants the energy supernova neutrinos ranges from few several tens however the sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected produce neutrinos that are least one million times more produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over supernova the supernova remnants the origin the cosmic rays was attributed supernovas walter baade and fritz zwicky this hypothesis was refined vitaly ginzburg and sergei syrovatsky who attributed the origin supernova and supported their claim the crucial that the cosmic ray losses the milky way the efficiency acceleration supernova remnants about percent ginzburg and hypothesis supported the specific mechanism shock wave happening supernova which consistent with the original theoretical picture drawn enrico fermi and receiving support from observational the very high energy neutrinos are still but this branch neutrino astronomy just its the main existing forthcoming experiments that aim observing very high energy neutrinos from our galaxy are baikal amanda icecube antares nemo and nestor related information provided very high energy gamma ray observatories such veritas hess and magic indeed the collisions cosmic rays are supposed produce charged whose decay give the and also neutral whose decay give gamma the environment supernova remnant transparent both types still higher energy resulting from the interactions extragalactic cosmic could observed with the pierre auger observatory with the dedicated experiment named anita big bang cosmic neutrino background thought just like the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang there background low energy neutrinos our the was proposed that these may the explanation for the dark matter thought exist the neutrinos have one important advantage over most other dark matter know they however they also have serious from particle known that neutrinos are very this means that they easily move speeds close the speed light thus dark matter made from neutrinos termed hot dark matter the problem that being fast the neutrinos would tend have spread out evenly the universe before cosmological expansion made them cold enough congregate this would cause the part dark matter made neutrinos smeared out and unable cause the large galactic structures that further these same galaxies and groups galaxies appear surrounded dark matter that not fast enough escape from those presumably this matter provided the gravitational nucleus for formation this implies that neutrinos make only small part the total amount dark from cosmological relic background neutrinos are estimated have density each type per cubic centimeter and temperature they are much colder their mass exceeds although their density quite they have not yet been observed the their energy below thresholds most detection and due extremely low neutrino interaction sections boron solar which are emitted with higher have been detected definitively despite having space density that lower than that relic neutrinos some orders detection neutrino detector neutrinos cannot detected because they not ionize the materials they are passing through they not carry electric charge and other proposed like the msw not produce traceable unique reaction identify sometimes referred inverse beta decay applied reines and cowan see requires very large detector order detect significant number all detection methods require the neutrinos carry minimum threshold there detection method for low

observatory uses the antarctic ice sheet near the south pole with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the motivation for scientific interest neutrinos low mass and neutral charge mean they interact exceedingly weakly with other particles and this feature weak interaction interests scientists because means neutrinos can used probe environments that other radiation such light radio cannot

density matter surrounding the the other neutrinos pass through the sun with few whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require years diffuse the outer layers the neutrinos generated stellar fusion reactions the core cross this distance practically unimpeded nearly the speed neutrinos are also useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond our solar system because they are the only known
