each other with force that directly proportional the product their masses and inversely proportional the square the distance between separately was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted all their mass were concentrated their centers this general physical law derived from empirical observations what isaac newton called induction part classical mechanics and was formulated work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica the first published july when book was presented the royal society robert hooke made claim that newton had obtained the inverse square law from him see history section modern the law states the point mass force line proportional product masses inversely proportional square where the force between the the gravitational constant the first the second and the distance between the centers the assuming units measured newtons and kilograms meters and the constant approximately equal the value the constant was first accurately determined from the results the cavendish experiment conducted the british scientist henry cavendish although cavendish did not himself calculate numerical value for this experiment was also the first test theory gravitation between masses the took place years after the publication principia and years after none calculations could use the value instead could only calculate force relative another newton law gravitation resembles coulomb law electrical which used calculate the magnitude electrical force between two charged both are inverse square laws which force inversely proportional the square the distance between the coulomb law has the product two charges place the product the and the electrostatic constant place the gravitational newton law has since been superseded theory general

solution extensions solutions law universal gravitation see also notes external links history early history recent assessment ofer about the early history the inverse square law that the late the assumption inverse proportion between gravity and the square distance was rather common and had been advanced number different people for different the same author does credit hooke with significant and even seminal but treats claim priority the inverse square point uninteresting since several individuals besides newton and hooke had least suggested and points instead the idea compounding the celestial and the conversion thinking away from centrifugal and towards centripetal force significant plagiarism dispute when the first book newton principia was presented the royal society robert hooke accused newton plagiarism claiming that had taken from him the notion the rule the decrease being reciprocally the squares the distances from the the same time according edmond halley contemporary hooke agreed that the demonstration the curves generated was wholly this way arose the question newton owed this subject extensively discussed since that and which some points still excite some hooke work and claims robert hooke published his ideas about the system the the when read the royal society march paper concerning the inflection direct motion into curve supervening attractive and published them again somewhat developed form addition attempt prove the motion the earth from hooke announced that planned explain system the world differing many particulars from any yet based three suppositions that all celestial bodies have attraction gravitating power towards their own they also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere their that all bodies whatsoever that are put into direct and simple will continue move forward straight till they are some other effectual powers deflected and and that these attractive powers are much the more powerful how much the nearer the body wrought upon their own thus hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the sun and way that increased with nearness the attracting together with principle linear hooke statements made however that inverse square law applies might apply these hooke gravitation was also not yet though approached universality more closely than previous also did not provide accompanying evidence mathematical the latter two hooke himself stated now what these several degrees are have not yet experimentally and his whole this only hint having self many other things hand which would first and therefore cannot well attend prosecuting this was later writing january that hooke communicated his supposition that the attraction always duplicate proportion the distance from the center and consequently that the velocity will subduplicate proportion the attraction and consequently kepler supposes reciprocall the the inference about the velocity was hooke correspondence with newton mentioned not only this inverse square supposition for the decline attraction with increasing but opening letter november approach compounding the celestial motions the planetts direct motion the tangent attractive motion towards the central newton work and claims newton faced may with claim the inverse square denied that hooke was credited author the among the newton recalled that the idea had been discussed with sir christopher wren previous letter newton also pointed out and acknowledged prior work including bullialdus who but without that there was attractive force from the sun the inverse square proportion the and borelli who also without that there was centrifugal tendency counterbalance with gravitational attraction towards the sun make the planets move whiteside has described the contribution thinking that came from copy which was library his newton further defended his work saying that had first heard the inverse square proportion from would still have some rights view his demonstrations its hooke without evidence favor the could only guess that the inverse square law was approximately valid great distances from the according while the was still publication there were many priori reasons doubt the accuracy the square law especially close attracting that without demonstrations which hooke yet cannot believed judicious philosopher any where this remark refers among other things supported mathematical that the inverse square law applies tiny then even large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external its even close exactly all its own mass were concentrated its thus newton gave otherwise for applying the inverse square law large spherical planetary masses they were tiny newton had formulated propositions book and associated sections book sensitive test the accuracy the inverse square which showed that only where the law force accurately the inverse square the distance will the directions orientation the orbital ellipses stay constant they are observed apart from small effects attributable planetary regard evidence that still survives the earlier manuscripts written newton the show that newton himself had arrived proofs that circular case planetary endeavour what was later called centrifugal had square relation with distance from the after his correspondence with newton adopted the language inward centripetal according newton scholar bruce although much has been made the change language and difference point between centrifugal centripetal the actual computations and proofs remained the same either they also involved the combination tangential and radial which newton was making the the lesson offered hooke newton although was one perspective and did not change the this background shows there was basis for newton deny deriving the inverse square law from newton acknowledgment the other newton did accept and all editions the that hooke but not exclusively had separately appreciated the inverse square law the solar newton acknowledged hooke and halley this connection the scholium proposition book newton also acknowledged halley that his correspondence with hooke had reawakened his dormant interest astronomical but that did not according that hooke had told newton anything new yet not beholden him for any light into that business but only for the diversion gave from other studies think these things for his dogmaticalness writing had found the motion the which inclined try modern controversy since the time newton and scholarly discussion has also touched the question whether mention compounding the provided newton with something new and even though that was not claim actually voiced hooke the described newton manuscripts the show him actually combining tangential motion with the effects radially directed force for example his derivation the inverse square relation for the circular they also show newton clearly expressing the concept linear for which was indebted work published hooke probably these matters not appear have been learned newton from nevertheless number authors have had more say about what newton gained from hooke and some aspects remain the fact that most private papers had been destroyed have disappeared does not help establish the newton role relation the inverse square law was not has sometimes been did not claim think bare what newton did was show how the square law attraction had many necessary mathematical connections with observable features the motions bodies the solar and that they were related such way that the observational evidence and the mathematical taken gave reason believe that the inverse square law was not just approximately true but exactly true the accuracy achievable time and for about two centuries afterwards and with some loose ends points that could not yet certainly where the implications the theory had not yet been adequately identified about thirty years after death alexis clairaut mathematical astronomer eminent his own right the field gravitational wrote after reviewing what hooke that one must not think that this idea hooke diminishes and that the example serves show what distance there between truth that glimpsed and truth that bodies with spatial extent the bodies question have spatial extent rather than being theoretical point then the gravitational force between them calculated summing the contributions the notional point masses which constitute the the the component point masses become infinitely this entails integrating the force vector see over the extents the two bodies this way can shown that object with symmetric distribution mass exerts the same gravitational attraction external bodies all the mass were concentrated point its this not generally true for symmetrical for points inside symmetric distribution newton shell theorem can used find the gravitational the theorem tells how different parts the mass distribution affect the gravitational force measured point located distance from the center the mass the portion the mass that located radii causes the same force all the mass enclosed within sphere radius was concentrated the center the mass distribution noted the portion the mass that located radii exerts net gravitational force the distance from the that the individual gravitational forces exerted the elements the sphere out the point cancel each other for within shell uniform thickness and density there net gravitational acceleration anywhere within the hollow furthermore inside uniform sphere the gravity increases linearly with the distance from the the increase due the additional mass times the decrease due the larger distance from the thus spherically symmetric body has uniform core and uniform mantle with density that less than that the then the gravity initially decreases outwardly beyond the and the sphere large further outward the gravity increases and eventually exceeds the gravity the mantle the gravity the earth may highest the mantle vector form parallel law universal gravitation can written vector equation account for the direction the gravitational force well its this quantities bold represent where gravitational constant unit vector can seen that the vector form the equation the same the scalar form given except that now vector and the right hand side multiplied the appropriate unit also can seen that gravitational field gravitational field the gravitational field vector field that describes the gravitational force which would applied object any given point per unit actually equal the gravitational acceleration that generalization the vector which becomes particularly useful more than objects are involved such rocket between the earth and the for objects object object the simply write instead and instead and define the gravitational field that can this formulation dependent the objects causing the the field has units this gravitational fields are also conservative that the work done gravity from one position another this has the consequence that there exists gravitational potential field such that point mass the mass sphere with homogeneous mass the force field outside the sphere depends only the distance from the center the that case the gravitational field inside and outside symmetric per gauss field symmetric body can foung the mathematical integral enclosed mass gaussian hence for hollow field inside surface field surface field outside surface for solid field inside surface distance from centree and rest fields are same hollow for cylinder given radius even height its field constant given problematic aspects newton description gravity sufficiently accurate for many practical purposes and therefore widely deviations from are small when the dimensionless quantities and are both much less than where the gravitational potential the velocity the objects being and the speed light for newtonian gravity provides accurate description the sun since where the radius the orbit around the situations where either dimensionless parameter then general relativity must used describe the general relativity reduces newtonian gravity the limit small potential and low law gravitation often said the gravity limit general theoretical concerns with expression there immediate prospect identifying the mediator attempts physicists identify the relationship between the gravitational force and other known fundamental forces are not yet although considerable headway has been made over the last years theory everything and standard model newton himself felt that the concept inexplicable action distance was unsatisfactory see newton reservations below but that there was nothing more that could the newton theory gravitation requires that the gravitational force transmitted given the classical assumptions the nature space and time before the development general significant propagation delay gravity leads unstable planetary and stellar observations conflicting with formula newton theory does not fully explain the precession the perihelion the orbits the especially planet mercury which was detected long after the life there arcsecond per century discrepancy between the newtonian which arises only from the gravitational attractions from the other and the observed made with advanced telescopes during the the predicted angular deflection light rays gravity that calculated using theory only half the deflection that actually observed calculations using general relativity are much closer agreement with the astronomical the observed fact that the gravitational mass and the inertial mass the same for all objects unexplained within general relativity takes this basic see the equivalence principle point the experiments galileo galilei decades before established that objects that have the same air fluid resistance are accelerated the force the gravity regardless their different inertial masses yet the forces and energies that are required accelerate various masses completely dependent upon their different inertial masses can seen from newton second law motion newton reservations while newton was able formulate his law gravity his monumental was deeply uncomfortable with the notion action which his equations his third letter that one body may act upon another distance through vacuum without the mediation anything and through which their action and force may conveyed from one great absurdity man who has philosophic matters competent faculty thinking could ever fall into his assigned the cause this all other used the phenomenon motion explain the origin various forces acting but the case was unable experimentally identify the motion that produces the force gravity although invented two mechanical hypotheses and moreover refused even offer hypothesis the cause this force grounds that was contrary sound lamented that philosophers have hitherto attempted the search nature for the source the gravitational was convinced many that there were causes hitherto that were fundamental all the phenomena these fundamental phenomena are still under investigation though hypotheses the definitive answer has yet and general scholium the second edition principia have not yet been able discover the cause these properties gravity from phenomena and feign hypotheses enough that gravity does really exist and acts according the laws have and that abundantly serves account for all the motions celestial einstein solution these objections were explained theory general relativity which gravitation attribute curved spacetime instead being due force propagated between energy and momentum distort spacetime their and other particles move trajectories determined the geometry this allowed description the motions light and mass that was consistent with all available general the gravitational force fictitious force due the curvature spacetime because the
