kepler horrocks halley euler alembert clairaut lagrange laplace hamilton poisson daniel bernoulli johann bernoulli cauchy laws motion are three physical laws that together laid the foundation for classical mechanics they describe the relationship between body and the forces acting upon and its motion response said they have been expressed several different ways over nearly three and can summarised first law when viewed inertial reference frame object either remains rest continues move constant velocity unless acted upon external force second law the vector sum the forces object equal the mass that object multiplied the acceleration vector the third law when one body exerts force second the second body simultaneously exerts force equal magnitude and opposite direction the first the three laws motion were first compiled isaac newton his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles natural philosophy first published newton used them explain and investigate the motion many physical objects and for the third volume the newton showed that these laws combined with his law universal gravitation explained kepler laws planetary motion contents overview newton first law newton second law impulse variable mass systems newton third law history newton law newton law newton law importance and range validity relationship the conservation laws see also references and notes further reading and works referred external links overview laws are applied objects which are idealised single point the sense that the size and shape the body are neglected focus its motion more this can done when the object small compared the distances involved its the deformation and rotation the body are this even planet can idealised particle for analysis its orbital motion around their original newton laws motion are not adequate characterise the motion rigid bodies and deformable bodies leonhard euler introduced generalisation laws motion for rigid bodies called the euler laws motion later applied well for deformable bodies assumed continuum body represented assemblage discrete each governed laws then laws can derived from euler laws however taken axioms describing the laws motion for extended independently any particle newton laws hold only with respect certain set frames reference called newtonian inertial reference frames some authors interpret the first law defining what inertial reference frame from this point the second law only holds when the observation made from inertial reference and therefore the first law cannot proved special case the other authors treat the first law corollary the the explicit concept inertial frame reference was not developed until long after the given interpretation mass acceleration momentum and most force are assumed externally defined this the most but not the only interpretation the way one can consider the laws definition these newtonian mechanics has been superseded special relativity but still useful approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the speed light newton first law play media mit course the first law states that the net force the vector sum all forces acting then the velocity the object velocity vector quantity which expresses both the speed and the direction its therefore the statement that the velocity constant statement that both its speed and the direction its motion are the first law can stated mathematically object that rest will stay rest unless external force acts upon object that motion will not change its velocity unless external force acts upon this known uniform motion object continues whatever happens doing unless force exerted upon continues state rest demonstrated when tablecloth skilfully whipped from under dishes tabletop and the dishes remain their initial state object continues move without turning changing its this evident space probes that continually move outer changes motion must imposed against the tendency object retain its state the absence net moving object tends move along straight line path newton placed the first law motion establish frames reference for which the other laws are the first law motion postulates the existence least one frame reference called newtonian inertial reference frame relative which the motion particle not subject forces straight line constant newton first law often referred the law inertia thus condition necessary for the uniform motion particle relative inertial reference frame that the total net force acting this the first law can restated every material the motion particle preferential reference frame determined the action forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity the particle constant that particle initially rest uniform motion the preferential frame continues that state unless compelled forces change newton laws are valid only inertial reference frame any reference frame that uniform motion with respect inertial frame also inertial galilean invariance the principle newtonian relativity newton second law download the clip download player mit ocw the second law states that the net force object equal the rate change that the derivative its linear momentum inertial reference frame the second law can also stated terms since second law only valid for mass mass can taken outside the differentiation operator the constant factor rule differentiation thus where the net force the mass the and the thus the net force applied body produces proportional other body then there force consistent with the first law the time derivative the momentum zero when the momentum changes even there change its such the case with uniform circular motion the relationship also implies the conservation momentum when the net force the body the momentum the body any net force equal the rate change the any mass that gained lost the system will cause change momentum that not the result external different equation necessary for mass systems see below newton second law requires modification the effects special relativity are taken into because high speeds the approximation that momentum the product rest mass and velocity not impulse impulse occurs when force acts over interval time and given since force the time derivative follows that this relation between impulse and momentum closer wording the second impulse concept frequently used the analysis collisions and variable mass systems mass system mass like rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent are not closed and cannot directly treated making mass function time the second that the following formula the falsehood this formula can seen noting that does not respect galilean invariance mass object with one frame will seen have another the correct equation motion for body whose mass varies with time either ejecting accreting mass obtained applying the second law the constant mass system consisting the body and its accreted the result where the velocity the escaping incoming mass relative the from this equation one can derive the equation motion for varying mass for the tsiolkovsky rocket equation under some the quantity the hand which represents the advection momentum defined force the force exerted the body the changing such rocket and included the quantity then substituting the definition the equation becomes newton third law play media the third law states that all forces exist one object exerts force second object then simultaneously exerts force and the two forces are equal and the third law means that all forces are interactions between different and thus that there such thing unidirectional force force that acts only one this law sometimes referred the action reaction law with called the action and the reaction the action and the reaction are and does not matter which called the action and which called reaction both forces are part single and neither force exists without the the two forces third law are the same type the road exerts forward frictional force accelerating then also frictional force that third law predicts for the tires pushing backward the from conceptual newton third law seen when person they push against the and the floor pushes against the similarly the tires car push against the road while the road pushes back the the tires and road simultaneously push against each person interacts with the pushing the water while the water simultaneously pushes the person both the person and the water push against each the reaction forces account for the motion these these forces depend person car for may unable exert the action force produce the needed reaction history law from the original latin principia lex corpus omne perseverare statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter nisi quatenus viribus impressis cogitur statum illum translated this the ancient greek philosopher aristotle had the view that all objects have natural place the that heavy objects such wanted rest the earth and that light objects like smoke wanted rest the sky and the stars wanted remain the thought that body was its natural state when was and for the body move straight line constant speed external agent was needed continually propel otherwise would stop galileo galilei however realised that force necessary change the velocity acceleration but force needed maintain its other galileo stated the absence moving object will continue the tendency objects resist changes motion was what galileo called inertia this insight was refined who made into his first also known the law force means and hence the body will maintain its first law restatement the law inertia which galileo had already newton appropriately gave credit the law inertia apparently occurred several different natural philosophers and scientists including thomas hobbes his leviathan the century philosopher and mathematician ren descartes also formulated the although did not perform any experiments confirm citation needed law original latin lex mutationem motus proportionalem esse motrici fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur this was translated quite closely translation according modern ideas how newton was using his this modern equivalent the change momentum body proportional the impulse impressed the and happens along the straight line which that impulse motte translation latin continued with commentary the second law reading force generates double force will generate double the triple force triple the whether that force impressed altogether and gradually and and this motion being always directed the same way with the generating the body moved added subtracted from the former according they directly conspire with are directly contrary each obliquely when they are produce new motion compounded from the determination the sense senses which newton used his and how understood the second law and intended have been extensively discussed historians along with the relations between formulation and modern newton law lex actioni contrariam semper qualem esse sive corporum duorum actiones mutuo semper esse quales partes contrarias translated this newton scholium explanatory this whatever draws presses another much drawn pressed that you press stone with your the finger also pressed the horse draws stone tied the horse may will equally drawn back towards the for the distended the same endeavour relax unbend will draw the horse much towards the does the stone towards the and will obstruct the progress the one much advances that the body impinges upon and its force changes the motion the that body also because the equality the mutual will undergo equal its own toward the contrary the changes made these actions are not the velocities but the motions the that the bodies are not hindered any other for the motions are equally the changes the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional the this law takes place also will proved the next the motion name for hence his careful distinction between motion and newton used the third law derive the law conservation momentum from deeper however conservation momentum the more fundamental idea derived via noether theorem from galilean invariance and holds cases where third law appears for instance when force fields well particles carry and quantum mechanics importance and range validity laws were verified experiment and observation for over years and they are excellent approximations the scales and speeds everyday newton laws together with his law universal gravitation and the mathematical techniques calculus provided for the first time unified quantitative explanation for wide range physical these three laws hold good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday however newton laws combined with universal gravitation and classical electrodynamics are inappropriate for use certain most notably very small very high speeds special relativity the lorentz factor must included the expression for momentum along with rest mass and very strong gravitational therefore the laws cannot used explain phenomena such conduction electricity semiconductor optical properties errors relativistically corrected gps systems and superconductivity explanation these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical including general relativity and quantum field theory quantum mechanics concepts such momentum and position are defined linear operators that operate the quantum state speeds that are much lower than the speed newton laws are just exact for these operators they are for classical speeds comparable the speed the second law holds the original form where and are four vectors relationship the conservation laws modern the laws conservation momentum energy and angular momentum are more general validity than since they apply both light and and both classical and classical this can stated energy and angular momentum cannot created because force the time derivative the concept force redundant and subordinate the conservation and not used fundamental theories quantum mechanics quantum electrodynamics general relativity etc the standard model explains detail how the three fundamental forces known gauge forces originate out exchange virtual particles other forces such gravity and fermionic degeneracy pressure also arise from the momentum indeed the conservation momentum inertial motion via curved time results what call gravitational force general relativity theory application space derivative which momentum operator quantum overlapping wave functions pair fermions particles with integer spin results shifts maxima compound wavefunction away from each which observable repulsion newton stated the third law within view that assumed instantaneous action distance between material however was prepared for philosophical criticism this action distance and was this context that stated the famous phrase feign hypotheses modern action distance has been completely except for subtle effects involving quantum entanglement citation needed however modern engineering all practical applications involving the motion vehicles and the concept action distance used the discovery the second law thermodynamics carnot the century showed that every physical quantity not conserved over thus disproving the validity inducing the opposite
