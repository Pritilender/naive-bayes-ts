reaction which two more atomic nuclei collide very high speed and join form new type atomic during this matter not conserved because some the matter the fusing nuclei converted photons energy fusion the process that powers active main sequence stars the fusion two nuclei with lower masses than iron along with nickel has the largest binding energy per nucleon generally releases while the fusion nuclei heavier than iron absorbs energy the opposite true for the reverse nuclear fission this means that fusion generally occurs for lighter elements and that fission normally occurs only for heavier there are extreme astrophysical events that can lead short periods fusion with heavier this the process that gives rise nucleosynthesis the creation the heavy elements during events such supernovae following the discovery quantum tunneling friedrich hund robert atkinson and fritz houtermans used the measured masses light elements predict that large amounts energy could released fusing small building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments ernest rutherford carried out several years the laboratory fusion hydrogen isotopes was first accomplished mark oliphant during the remainder that decade the steps the main cycle nuclear fusion stars were worked out hans bethe research into fusion for military purposes began the early part the manhattan project fusion was accomplished with the greenhouse item nuclear nuclear fusion large scale explosion was first carried out november the ivy mike hydrogen bomb test research into developing controlled thermonuclear fusion for civil purposes also began earnest the and continues this two the national ignition facility and iter have the goal high gains that producing more energy than required ignite the after years design improvements

reading external links overview deuterium tritium neutron mev kinetic the origin the energy released fusion light elements due interplay two opposing the nuclear force which combines together protons and and the coulomb force which causes protons repel each the protons are positively charged and repel each other but they nonetheless stick demonstrating the existence another force referred nuclear this called the strong nuclear overcomes electric repulsion very close the effect this force not observed outside the hence the force has strong dependence making range the same force also pulls the neutrons neutrons and protons because the nuclear force stronger than the coulomb force for atomic nuclei smaller than iron and building these nuclei from lighter nuclei fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction these for larger nuclei however energy since the nuclear force range and cannot continue act across still larger atomic thus energy longer released when such nuclei are made instead energy absorbed such fusion reactions light elements power the stars and produce virtually all elements process called nucleosynthesis the fusion lighter elements stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies for the fusion two hydrogen nuclei form the mass carried away from the system the form kinetic energy other forms energy such electromagnetic research into controlled with the aim producing fusion power for the production has been conducted for over years has been accompanied extreme scientific and technological but has resulted controlled fusion reactions have been unable produce even controlled fusion workable designs for reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed heat plasma required temperatures are development see iter the iter facility expected finish its construction phase will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments but not expected begin full tritium fusion until takes considerable energy force nuclei even those the lightest hydrogen this because all nuclei have positive charge due their and like charges nuclei strongly resist being put close accelerated high they can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and forced close enough for the attractive nuclear force sufficiently strong achieve the fusion lighter which creates heavier nucleus and often free neutron generally releases more energy than takes force the nuclei this exothermic process that can produce sustaining the national ignition facility which uses driven inertial confinement fusion thought capable even the first scale laser target experiments were performed june and ignition experiments began early energy released most nuclear reactions much larger than chemical reactions because the binding energy that holds nucleus together far greater than the energy that holds electrons for the ionization energy gained adding electron hydrogen nucleus less than millionth the mev released the deuterium tritium reaction shown the diagram the right one gram matter would release fusion reactions have energy density many times greater than nuclear fission the reactions produce far greater energy per unit mass even though individual fission reactions are generally much more energetic than individual fusion which are themselves millions times more energetic than chemical only direct conversion mass into energy such that caused the annihilatory collision matter and antimatter more energetic per unit mass than nuclear requirements substantial energy barrier electrostatic forces must overcome before fusion can large two naked nuclei repel one another because the repulsive electrostatic force between their positively charged protons two nuclei can brought close enough however the electrostatic repulsion can overcome the attractive nuclear force which stronger close when nucleon such proton neutron added the nuclear force attracts other but primarily its immediate neighbours due the short range the the nucleons the interior nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those the since smaller nuclei have larger surface volume the binding energy per nucleon due the nuclear force generally increases with the size the nucleus but approaches limiting value corresponding that nucleus with diameter about four important keep mind that the above picture toy model because nucleons are quantum objects and for since two neutrons nucleus are identical each distinguishing one from the such which one the interior and which the fact and the inclusion quantum mechanics necessary for proper the electrostatic the other inverse square force proton added nucleus will feel electrostatic repulsion from all the other protons the the electrostatic energy per nucleon due the electrostatic force thus increases without limit nuclei get electrostatic force nuclear force the net result these opposing forces that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing the elements iron and nickel and then decreases for heavier eventually the binding energy becomes negative and very heavy nuclei all with more than nucleons corresponding diameter about nucleons are not the four most tightly bound decreasing order binding energy per are and even though the nickel isotope more the iron isotope order magnitude more this due the fact that there easy way for stars create through the alpha exception this general trend the helium nucleus whose binding energy higher than that lithium the next heaviest this because protons and neutrons are fermions which according the pauli exclusion principle cannot exist the same nucleus exactly the same each proton neutron energy state nucleus can accommodate both spin particle and spin down helium has anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists two protons and two all four its nucleons can the ground any additional nucleons would have into higher energy indeed the nucleus tightly bound that commonly treated single particle nuclear namely the alpha particle the situation similar two nuclei are brought they approach each all the protons one nucleus repel all the protons the not until the two nuclei actually come contact can the strong nuclear force take consequently even when the final energy state there large energy barrier that must first called the coulomb barrier the coulomb barrier smallest for isotopes their nuclei contain only single positive diproton not neutrons must also ideally such way that helium with its extremely tight one the using deuterium tritium fuel the resulting energy barrier about citation needed the energy needed remove electron from hydrogen about times less the result the fusion unstable which immediately ejects neutron with citation needed the recoil energy the remaining nucleus citation needed the total energy liberated citation needed this many times more than what was needed overcome the energy the reaction cross section measure the probability fusion reaction function the relative velocity the two reactant the reactants have distribution thermal distribution with thermonuclear fusion then useful perform average over the distributions the product cross section and this average called the denoted the reaction rate fusions per volume per times the product the reactant number species

confinement fusion inertial confinement fusion icf type fusion energy research that attempts initiate nuclear fusion reactions heating and compressing fuel typically the form pellet that most often contains mixture deuterium and tritium beam beam target fusion the energy initiate the reaction comes from accelerating one the the process called beam target fusion both nuclei are beam beam fusion accelerator based ion fusion technique using particle accelerators achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient induce ion fusion accelerating light ions relatively and can done efficient all takes vacuum pair and voltage fusion can observed with little between the key problem with based fusion and with cold targets that fusion cross sections are many orders magnitude lower than coulomb interaction cross therefore the vast majority ions end expending their energy bremsstrahlung and ionization atoms the devices referred tube neutron generators are particularly relevant this these small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas arrangement that allows ions these nuclei accelerated against hydride also containing deuterium and where fusion takes hundreds neutron generators are produced annually for use the petroleum industry where they are used measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil muon catalyzed fusion muon catalyzed fusion established and reproducible fusion process that occurs ordinary was studied detail steven jones the early net energy production from this reaction cannot occur because the high energy required create muons their short half life and the high chance that muon will bind the new alpha particle and thus stop catalyzing other principles tokamak configuration variable cole polytechnique rale lausanne some other confinement principles have been some them have been confirmed run nuclear fusion while having lesser expectation eventually being able produce net others have not yet been shown produce sonofusion bubble fusion controversial variation the sonoluminescence theme suggests that acoustic shock creating temporary bubbles that expand and collapse shortly after can produce temperatures and pressures sufficient for nuclear the farnsworth hirsch fusor tabletop device which fusion this fusion comes from high effective temperatures produced electrostatic acceleration the polywell thermodynamic equilibrium machine that uses electrostatic confinement accelerate ions into center where they fuse antimatter initialized fusion uses small amounts antimatter trigger tiny fusion this has been studied primarily the context making nuclear pulse propulsion and pure fusion bombs feasible this not near becoming practical power due the cost manufacturing antimatter pyroelectric fusion was reported april team ucla the scientists used pyroelectric crystal heated from combined with tungsten needle produce electric field about gigavolts per meter ionize and accelerate deuterium nuclei into erbium deuteride the estimated energy the fusion reaction may producing helium and mev neutron although makes useful neutron the apparatus not intended for power generation since requires far more energy than hybrid nuclear fission hybrid nuclear proposed means generating power use combination nuclear fusion and fission processes the concept dates the and was briefly advocated hans bethe during the but largely remained unexplored until revival interest due the delays the realization pure project pacer carried out los alamos national laboratory the explored the possibility fusion power system that would involve exploding small hydrogen bombs fusion inside underground energy the system the only fusion power system that could demonstrated work using existing however would also require continuous supply nuclear making the economics such system rather important reactions astrophysical reaction chains proton proton chain cno cycle the most important fusion process nature the one that powers the net result the fusion four protons into one alpha particle with the release two positrons two neutrinos which changes two the protons into and but several individual reactions are depending the mass the for stars the size the sun the proton proton chain dominates heavier the cno cycle more both types processes are responsible for the creation new elements part stellar nucleosynthesis the temperatures and densities stellar cores the rates fusion reactions are notoriously for solar core temperature and density the energy release rate only about quarter the volumetric rate which resting human body generates thus reproduction stellar core conditions lab for nuclear fusion power production completely because nuclear reaction rates strongly depend temperature achieving reasonable energy production rates terrestrial fusion reactors requires times higher temperatures compared stellar criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions fusion power fuels artificial the primary fuel not constrained protons and higher temperatures can reactions with larger sections are this implies lower lawson criterion and therefore less startup another concern the production which activate the reactor structure but also have the advantages allowing volumetric extraction the fusion energy and tritium breeding reactions that release neutrons are referred aneutronic useful energy fusion reaction must satisfy several exothermic this limits the reactants the low number side the curve binding energy also makes helium the most common product because its extraordinarily tight although and also show involve low nuclei this because the electrostatic repulsion must overcome before the nuclei are close enough have two reactants anything less than stellar three body collisions are too inertial both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded compensate for the shortcomings the third parameter the lawson icf very short confinement have two more products this allows simultaneous conservation energy and momentum without relying the electromagnetic conserve both protons and neutrons the cross sections for the weak interaction are too few reactions meet these the following are those with the largest cross citation needed mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev mev nucleosynthesis stellar nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis supernova nucleosynthesis cosmic ray spallation astrophysics process process nuclear fission for reactions with two the energy divided between them inverse proportion their most reactions with three the distribution energy for reactions that can result more than one set the branching ratios are some reaction candidates can eliminated the reaction has advantage compared because roughly difficult burn but produces substantially more neutrons through side there also reaction but the cross section far too except possibly when mev but such high temperatures direct producing reaction also becomes very finally there also reaction which not only difficult but can easily induced split into two alpha particles and addition the fusion the following reactions with neutrons are important order breed tritium dry fusion bombs and some proposed fusion the latter the two equations was unknown when the conducted the castle bravo fusion bomb test being just the second fusion bomb ever tested and the first use the designers the castle bravo shrimp had understood the usefulness tritium but had failed recognize that fission would greatly increase the yield the while has small neutron section for low neutron has higher cross section above mev also undergoes chain reaction due its release neutron after the yield was greater than the predicted and caused heavy casualties from the fallout evaluate the usefulness these addition the the and the energy one needs know something about the cross any given fusion device has maximum plasma pressure can and economical device would always operate near this given this the largest fusion output obtained when the temperature chosen that this also the temperature which the value the triple product required for ignition since that required value inversely proportional see lawson criterion plasma ignited the fusion reactions produce enough power maintain the temperature without external this optimum temperature and the value that temperature given for few these reactions the following note that many the reactions form for reactor fueled with and creates some which then possible use the reaction the energies are right elegant idea combine the reactions and the from reaction can react with reaction before completely this produces energetic which turn undergoes reaction before detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work citation needed but good example case where the usual assumption maxwellian plasma not neutronicity confinement and power density ignition hydrogen bomb ivy mike any the reactions above can principle the basis fusion power production addition the temperature and cross section discussed must consider the total energy the fusion products the energy the charged fusion products and the atomic number the hydrogenic specification the reaction entails some though begin one must average over the two branches and more difficult decide how treat the and products burns well deuterium plasma that almost impossible extract from the the reaction optimized much higher the burnup the optimum temperature may seems reasonable assume the but not the gets burned and adds its energy the net thus the total reaction would the sum and count the fusion energy per reaction not per pair deuterium mev and the energy charged particles the tritium ion reacts with deuteron while still has large kinetic then the kinetic energy the produced may quite different from mev this calculation energy charged particles only another unique aspect the reaction that there only one which must taken into account when calculating the reaction with this tabulate parameters for four the most important reactions the last column the neutronicity the the fraction the fusion energy released this important indicator the magnitude the problems associated with neutrons like radiation biological remote and for the first two reactions calculated for the last two where this calculation would give the values quoted are rough estimates based side reactions that produce neutrons plasma thermal the reactants should also mixed the optimal this the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the assuming that the total pressure this means that density the hydrogenic ion smaller than that the hydrogenic ion factor therefore the rate for these reactions reduced the same top any differences the values the other because the reaction has only one its rate twice high when the fuel divided between two different hydrogenic thus creating more efficient thus there penalty for hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more which take pressure without participating the fusion usually good assumption that the electron temperature will nearly equal the ion some however discuss the possibility that the electrons could maintained substantially colder than the such known hot ion the penalty would not there the same time bonus factor for because each ion can react with any the other not just fraction can now compare these reactions the following the maximum value taken from previous the factor that related hydrogenic reactant species the values the column reactivity are found dividing the product the second and third indicates the factor which the other reactions occur more slowly than the reaction under comparable the column lawson criterion weights these results with and gives indication how much more difficult achieve ignition with these relative the difficulty for the reaction the last column labeled power and weights the practical reactivity with indicates how much lower the fusion power density the other reactions compared the reaction and can considered measure the economic bremsstrahlung losses isotropic plasmas the ions undergoing fusion many systems will essentially never occur alone but will mixed with electrons that aggregate neutralize the bulk electrical charge and form plasma the electrons will generally have temperature comparable greater than that the they will collide with the ions and emit ray radiation kev energy bremsstrahlung the sun and stars are opaque but essentially any terrestrial fusion reactor will optically thin for rays this energy rays are difficult reflect but they are effectively absorbed and converted into less than thickness stainless steel which part the ratio fusion power produced ray radiation lost walls important figure this ratio generally maximized much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density see the previous the following table shows estimates the optimum temperature and the power ratio that temperature for several the actual ratios fusion bremsstrahlung power will likely significantly lower for several for the calculation assumes that the energy the fusion products transmitted completely the fuel which then lose energy the electrons which turn lose energy however because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel they will give significant fraction their energy directly the secondly the ions the plasma are assumed purely fuel there will significant proportion impurity which will then lower the the fusion products themselves must remain the plasma until they have given their and will remain some time after that any proposed confinement finally all channels energy loss other than bremsstrahlung have been the last two factors are theoretical and experimental particle and energy confinement seem closely confinement scheme that does good job retaining fusion products will build the fusion products are efficiently then energy confinement will too the temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared the bremsstrahlung are every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value the fusion triple product this will not change the optimum operating point for very much because the bremsstrahlung fraction but will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative even lower and the required confinement even more difficult for and bremsstrahlung losses will possibly prohibitive for and the bremsstrahlung losses appear make fusion reactor using these fuels with isotropic plasma some ways out this dilemma are and fundamental limitations plasma fusion systems not thermodynamic
