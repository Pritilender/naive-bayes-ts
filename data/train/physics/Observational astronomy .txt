and june telescope kitt peak national observatory observational astronomy division the astronomical science that concerned with recording contrast with theoretical astrophysics which mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications physical models the practice observing celestial objects using telescopes and other astronomical the study astronomy somewhat hindered that direct experiments with the properties the distant universe are not however this partly compensated the fact that astronomers have vast number visible examples stellar phenomena that can this allows for observational data plotted graphs and general trends nearby examples specific such variable stars can then used infer the behavior more distant those distant yardsticks can then employed measure other phenomena that including the distance galaxy galileo galilei turned telescope the heavens and recorded what since that observational astronomy has made steady advances with each improvement telescope traditional division observational astronomy given the region the electromagnetic spectrum optical astronomy the part astronomy that uses optical components lenses and state observe light from near infrared near ultraviolet visible light astronomy using wavelengths that can detected with the about falls the middle this infrared astronomy deals with the detection and analysis infrared radiation this typically refers wavelengths longer than the detection limit silicon state about the most common tool the reflecting telescope but with detector sensitive infrared space telescopes are used certain wavelengths where the atmosphere eliminate noise thermal radiation from the radio astronomy detects radiation millimetre dekametre the receivers are similar those used radio broadcast transmission but much more see also radio telescopes high energy astronomy includes ray astronomy gamma ray astronomy and extreme astronomy well studies neutrinos and cosmic rays silla observatory optical and radio astronomy can performed with based because the atmosphere relatively transparent the wavelengths being observatories are usually located high altitudes minimise the absorption and distortion caused the some wavelengths infrared light are heavily absorbed water vapor many infrared observatories are located dry places high the atmosphere opaque the wavelengths used ray gamma ray astronomy and except for few wavelength windows far infrared astronomy observations must carried out mostly from balloons space powerful gamma rays however detected the large air showers they and the study cosmic rays rapidly expanding branch for much the history observational almost all observation was performed the visual spectrum with optical telescopes while the atmosphere relatively transparent this portion the electromagnetic spectrum most telescope work still dependent seeing conditions and air and generally restricted the night the seeing conditions depend the turbulence and thermal variations the locations that are frequently cloudy suffer from atmospheric turbulence limit the resolution likewise the presence the full moon can brighten the sky with scattered hindering observation faint for observation the optimal location for optical telescope undoubtedly outer space there the telescope can make observations without being affected the atmosphere however present remains costly lift telescopes into orbit thus the next best locations are certain mountain peaks that have high number cloudless days and generally possess good atmospheric conditions with good seeing conditions the peaks the islands mauna hawaii and palma possess these lesser extent inland sites such llano chajnantor paranal cerro tololo and silla chile these observatory locations have attracted assemblage powerful totalling many billion dollars the darkness the night sky important factor optical with the size cities and human populated areas ever the amount artificial light night has also these artificial lights produce diffuse background illumination that makes observation faint astronomical features very difficult without special few locations such the state arizona and the united kingdom this has led campaigns for the reduction light pollution the use hoods around street lights not only improves the amount light directed toward the but also helps reduce the light directed toward the atmospheric effects astronomical seeing can severely hinder the resolution without some means correcting for the blurring effect the shifting telescopes larger than about aperture can not achieve their theoretical resolution visible the primary benefit using very large telescopes has been the improved gathering allowing very faint magnitudes however the resolution handicap has begun overcome adaptive optics speckle imaging and interferometric imaging well the use space telescopes astronomers have number observational tools that they can use make measurements the for objects that are relatively close the sun and direct and very precise position measurements can made against more distant and thereby nearly background early observations this nature were used develop very precise orbital models the various and determine their respective masses and gravitational perturbations such measurements led the discovery the planets uranus neptune and pluto they also resulted erroneous assumption fictional planet vulcan within the orbit mercury but the explanation the precession orbit einstein considered one the triumphs his general relativity theory contents other instruments observation tools observing see also related lists references other instruments alma addition examination the universe the optical astronomers have increasingly been able acquire information other portions the electromagnetic the earliest such optical measurements were made the thermal properties the sun instruments employed during solar eclipse could used measure the radiation from the corona with the discovery radio waves radio astronomy began emerge new discipline the long wavelengths radio waves required much larger collecting dishes order make images with good and later led the development the dish interferometer for making resolution aperture synthesis radio images radio the development the microwave horn receiver led the discovery the microwave background radiation associated with the big bang radio astronomy has continued expand its even using radio astronomy satellites produce interferometers with baselines much larger than the size the however the expanding use the radio spectrum for other uses gradually drowning out the faint radio signals from the for this the future radio astronomy might performed from shielded such the far side the moon the last part the twentieth century saw rapid technological advances astronomical optical telescopes were growing ever and employing adaptive optics partly negate atmospheric new telescopes were launched into and began observing the universe the infrared ultraviolet ray and gamma ray parts the electromagnetic well observing cosmic rays interferometer arrays produced the first extremely resolution images using aperture synthesis infrared and optical orbiting instruments such the hubble space telescope produced rapid advances astronomical acting the workhorse for light observations faint new space instruments under development are expected directly observe planets around other perhaps even some like addition astronomers have begun using other instruments make neutrino astronomy the branch astronomy that observes astronomical objects with neutrino detectors special usually huge underground nuclear reactions stars and supernova explosions produce very large numbers neutrinos very few which may detected neutrino telescope neutrino astronomy motivated the possibility observing processes that are inaccessible optical telescopes such the sun core gravitational wave detectors are being designed that may capture events such collisions massive objects such neutron stars robotic spacecraft are also being increasingly used make highly detailed observations planets within the solar system that the field planetary science now has significant over with the disciplines geology and meteorology observation tools skalnat pleso observatory slovakia the key instrument nearly all modern observational astronomy the telescope this serves the dual purposes gathering more light that very faint objects can and magnifying the image that small and distant objects can optical astronomy requires telescopes that use optical components great typical requirements for grinding and polishing curved for require the surface within fraction wavelength light particular conic shape many modern telescopes actually consist arrays telescopes working together provide higher resolution through aperture synthesis large telescopes are housed both protect them from the weather and stabilize the environmental for the temperature different from one side the telescope the the shape the structure due thermal expansion pushing optical elements out this can affect the for this the domes are usually bright white titanium dioxide unpainted domes are often opened around long before observing can that air can circulate and bring the entire telescope the same temperature the prevent buffet other vibrations affecting standard practice mount the telescope concrete pier whose foundations are entirely separate from those the surrounding dome and almost any scientific work requires that telescopes track objects they wheel across the visible other they must smoothly compensate for the rotation the until the advent computer controlled drive the standard solution was some form equatorial mount and for small telescopes this still the however this structurally poor design and becomes more and more cumbersome the diameter and weight the telescope the largest equatorial mounted telescope the inch hale telescope whereas recent telescopes use the structurally better altazimuth mount and are actually physically smaller than the despite the larger there are design projects underway for gigantic the thirty metre telescope and the diameter overwhelmingly large telescope amateur astronomers use such instruments the newtonian reflector the refractor and the increasingly popular maksutov telescope the photograph has served critical role observational astronomy for over but the last years has been largely replaced for imaging applications digital sensors such ccds and cmos chips specialist areas astronomy such photometry and interferometry have utilised electronic detectors for much longer period astrophotography uses specialised photographic film usually glass plate coated with photographic emulsion but there are number particularly low quantum efficiency the order whereas ccds can tuned for narrow almost all modern telescope instruments are electronic and older telescopes have been either been retrofitted with these instruments closed glass plates are still used some such citation needed because the resolution possible with chemical film much higher than any electronic detector yet prior the invention all astronomy was done with the naked however even before films became sensitive scientific astronomy moved entirely because the overwhelming the human eye discards what sees from second but photographic film gathers more and more light for long the shutter the resulting image many astronomers can use the same possible see objects they change over time spectacular the blink comparator instrument that used compare two nearly identical photographs made the same section sky different points the comparator alternates illumination the two and any changes are revealed blinking points this instrument has been used find asteroids comets and variable stars nice observatory the position wire micrometer implement that has been used measure double stars this consists pair movable lines that can moved together the telescope lens lined the pair and oriented using position wires that lie right angles the star the movable wires are then adjusted match the two star the separation the stars then read off the and their true separation determined based the magnification the vital instrument observational astronomy the spectrograph the absorption specific wavelengths light elements allows specific properties distant bodies this capability has resulted the discovery the element helium the emission spectrum and has allowed astronomers determine great deal information concerning distant galaxies and other celestial doppler shift particularly redshift spectra can also used determine the radial motion distance with respect the earth early spectrographs employed banks prisms that split light into broad later the grating spectrograph was which reduced the amount light loss compared prisms and provided higher spectral the spectrum can photographed long allowing the spectrum faint objects such distant stellar photometry came into use means measuring stellar colors this technique measured the magnitude star specific frequency allowing determination the overall and therefore temperature internationally standardized system magnitudes was photoelectric photometry using the ccd now frequently used make observations through these sensitive instruments can record the image nearly down the level individual photons and can designed view parts the spectrum that are invisible the the ability record the arrival small numbers photons over period time can allow degree computer correction for atmospheric sharpening the multiple digital images can also combined further enhance the when combined with the adaptive optics technology image quality can approach the theoretical resolution capability the filters are used view object particular frequencies frequency multilayer film filters can provide very precise control the frequencies transmitted and for objects can viewed particular frequency emitted only excited hydrogen atoms filters can also used partially compensate for the effects light pollution blocking out unwanted polarization filters can also used determine source emitting polarized and the orientation the observing astronomers observe wide range astronomical including redshift agns the afterglow from the big bang and many different types stars and variety data can observed for each the position coordinates locate the object the sky using the techniques spherical astronomy and the magnitude determines its brightness seen from the earth the relative brightness different parts the spectrum yields information about the temperature and physics the photographs the spectra allow the chemistry

used measure its velocity relative the variations the brightness the star give evidence instabilities the else the presence occulting the orbits binary stars can used measure the relative masses each the total mass the spectroscopic binaries can found observing doppler shifts the spectrum the star and its close stars identical masses that formed the same time and under similar conditions typically have nearly identical observed observing mass closely associated such globular cluster allows data assembled about the distribution stellar these tables can then used infer the age the for distant galaxies and agns observations are made the overall shape and properties the well the groupings where they are observations certain types variable stars and supernovae known luminosity called standard candles other galaxies allows the inference the distance the host the expansion space causes the spectra these galaxies depending the and modified the doppler effect the radial both the size the
