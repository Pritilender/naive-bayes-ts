usually referred matter and radiation current particles are excitations quantum fields and interact following their although the word particle can used reference many objects proton gas even household the term particle usually refers the study smallest particles and the fundamental fields that must defined order explain the observed these cannot defined combination other clarification needed fundamental the current set fundamental fields and their dynamics are summarized theory called the standard model therefore particle physics largely the study the standard particle content and its possible contents subatomic particles history standard model experimental laboratories theory practical applications future see also references further reading external links subatomic particles standard model physics modern particle physics research focused subatomic particles including atomic constituents such electrons protons and neutrons protons and neutrons are composite particles called baryons made quarks produced radioactive and scattering processes such photons neutrinos and muons well wide range exotic particles dynamics particles also governed quantum mechanics they exhibit wave particle duality displaying like behavior under certain experimental conditions and wave like behavior more technical they are described quantum state vectors hilbert space which also treated quantum field theory following the convention particle the term elementary particles applied those particles that according current presumed indivisible and not composed other types generations antiparticle colors quarks leptons gluons photon higgs all and their interactions observed can described almost entirely quantum field theory called the standard model the standard currently has elementary those elementary particles can combine form composite accounting for the hundreds other species particles that have been discovered since the the standard model has been found agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted however most particle physicists believe that incomplete description and that more fundamental theory awaits discovery see theory everything

matter composed elementary particles dates least the century the john dalton through his work stoichiometry concluded that each element nature was composed unique type the word atom after the greek word atomos meaning indivisible denotes the smallest particle chemical element since but physicists soon discovered that atoms are the fundamental particles but conglomerates even smaller such the electron the early century explorations nuclear physics and quantum physics culminated proofs nuclear fission lise meitner based experiments otto hahn and nuclear fusion hans bethe that same both discoveries also led the development nuclear weapons throughout the and bewildering variety particles were found scattering experiments was referred the particle zoo that term was deprecated after the formulation the standard model during the which the large number particles was explained combinations small number fundamental standard model standard model the current state the classification all elementary particles explained the standard model describes the strong weak and electromagnetic fundamental interactions using mediating gauge bosons the species gauge bosons are the gluons and bosons and the photons the standard model also contains fundamental particles particles and their associated which are the constituents all matter finally the standard model also predicted the existence type boson known the higgs boson early the morning july physicists with the large hadron collider cern announced they have found new particle that behaves similarly what expected from the higgs experimental laboratories particle the major international laboratories are located brookhaven national laboratory long island united states its main facility the relativistic heavy ion collider which collides heavy ions such gold ions and polarized the first heavy ion and the only polarized proton not citation given budker institute nuclear physics novosibirsk russia its main projects are now the positron colliders vepp operated since and started experiments earlier facilities include the first electron beam collider vep which conducted experiments from the positron colliders vepp operated from and its successor performed experiments from cern franco swiss border near geneva its main project now the large hadron collider which had its first beam circulation september and now the most energetic collider also became the most energetic collider heavy ions after began colliding lead earlier facilities include the large positron collider which was stopped november and then dismantled give way for and the super proton synchrotron which being reused accelerator for the desy hamburg germany its main facility the hadron elektron ring anlage which collides electrons and positrons with fermilab batavia united states its main facility until was the tevatron which collided protons and antiprotons and was the energy particle collider earth until the large hadron collider surpassed

wilson yang yukawa theoretical particle physics attempts develop the theoretical and mathematical tools understand current experiments and make predictions for future see also theoretical physics there are several major interrelated efforts being made theoretical particle physics one important branch attempts better understand the standard model and its extracting the parameters the standard from experiments with less this work probes the limits the standard model and therefore expands our understanding building those efforts are made challenging the difficulty calculating quantities quantum chromodynamics some theorists working this area refer themselves phenomenologists and they may use the tools quantum field theory and effective field theory others make use lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theorists another major effort model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the standard model higher energies smaller this work often motivated the hierarchy problem and constrained existing experimental may involve work supersymmetry alternatives the higgs mechanism extra spatial dimensions such the randall sundrum models preon theory combinations other third major effort theoretical particle physics string theory string theorists attempt construct unified description quantum mechanics and general relativity building theory based small and branes rather than the theory may considered theory everything there are also other areas work theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology loop quantum gravity this division efforts particle physics reflected the names categories the arxiv preprint archive hep hep hep hep lat lattice gauge theory practical applications all physics and practical applications developed can derived from the study fundamental even particle taken mean only energy atom many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses cyclotrons are used produce medical isotopes for research and treatment for isotopes used pet imaging used directly for certain cancer the development superconductors has been pushed forward their use particle the world wide web and touchscreen technology were initially developed cern additional applications are found national industry computing science and workforce illustrating long and growing list beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle future the primary which pursued several distinct find and understand what physics may lie beyond the standard model there are several powerful experimental reasons expect new including dark matter and neutrino mass there are also theoretical hints that this new physics should found accessible energy furthermore there may surprises that will give opportunities learn about much the effort find this new physics are focused new collider the large hadron collider was completed help continue the search for the higgs boson supersymmetric particles and other new intermediate goal the construction the international linear collider which will complement the lhc allowing more precise measurements the properties newly found august decision for the technology the ilc was taken but the site has still agreed there are important collider experiments that also attempt find and understand physics beyond the standard model one important collider effort the determination the neutrino masses since these masses may arise from neutrinos mixing with very heavy cosmological observations provide many useful constraints the dark although may impossible determine the exact nature the dark matter without the finally lower bounds the very long lifetime the proton put constraints grand unified theories energy scales much higher
