performed over neighboring although the electric forces real solids extend this approximation nevertheless valid because the fields produced distant atoms are effectively screened secondly the potentials are treated harmonic potentials this permissible long the atoms remain close their equilibrium formally this accomplished taylor expanding about its equilibrium value quadratic giving proportional the displacement and the elastic force simply proportional the error ignoring higher order terms remains small remains close the equilibrium the resulting lattice may visualized system

vibration waves propagating through the one such wave shown the figure the the amplitude the wave given the displacements the atoms from their equilibrium the wavelength there minimum possible given twice the equilibrium separation between any wavelength shorter than this can mapped onto wavelength longer than due the periodicity the not every possible lattice vibration has defined wavelength and however the normal modes possess defined wavelengths and frequencies one dimensional lattice order simplify the analysis needed for dimensional lattice atoms convenient model dimensional lattice

constant the spring and the mass the atom then the equation motion the atom this set coupled equations and since the solutions are expected new coordinates can defined discrete fourier order couple put here replaces the usual continuous variable the are known the normal substitution into the equation motion produces the following decoupled this requires significant manipulation using the orthonormality and completeness relations the discrete fourier transform these are the equations for harmonic oscillators which have the each normal coordinate represents independent vibrational mode

previous the positions the masses are denoted measured from their equilibrium positions particle its equilibrium two more the are vector the hamiltonian for this system where the mass each atom assuming equal for and and are the position and momentum operators for the atom and the sum made over the nearest neighbors however one expects that lattice there could also appear waves that behave like customary deal with waves fourier space which uses normal modes the wavevector variables instead coordinates the number normal modes same the number however the fourier space very useful given the periodicity the set normal may defined the discrete fourier transforms the and conjugate defined the fourier transforms the the quantity turns out the wave number the divided the wavelength this choice retains the desired commutation relations either real space wave vector space from the general result the potential energy term where the hamiltonian may written wave vector space the couplings

dimensional the wave number replaced dimensional wave vector furthermore each now associated with three normal the new indices label the polarization the the dimensional the atoms were restricted moving along the the phonons corresponded longitudinal waves three vibration not restricted the direction and can also occur the perpendicular like transverse waves this gives rise the additional normal which the form the hamiltonian may view independent species dispersion relation for dimensional alternating array two types ion atom mass repeated periodically distance connected springs spring constant two modes vibration where the vector the vibration related its wavelength the connection between frequency and known dispersion relation the plus sign results the called optical mode and the minus sign the acoustic mode the optical mode two adjacent different atoms move against each while the acoustic mode they move the speed propagation acoustic which also the speed sound the given the slope the acoustic dispersion see group velocity low values long the dispersion relation almost and the speed sound approximately independent the phonon packets phonons with different but wavelengths can propagate for large distances across the lattice without breaking this the reason that sound propagates through solids without significant this behavior fails large values short due the microscopic details the for crystal that has least two atoms its primitive cell which may may not the dispersion relations exhibit two types namely optical and acoustic modes corresponding the upper blue and lower red curve the respectively the vertical axis the energy frequency while the horizontal axis the wave vector the boundaries and are those the first brillouin zone also interesting that for crystal with different atoms primitive cell there are always three acoustic one longitudinal acoustic mode and two transverse acoustic modes the number optical modes the lower figure shows the dispersion relations for several phonon modes gaas function wavevector the principal directions its brillouin many phonon dispersion curves have been measured neutron scattering the physics sound fluids differs from the physics sound although both are density sound waves fluids only have longitudinal whereas sound waves solids have longitudinal and transverse this because fluids support shear stresses but see viscoelastic fluids which only apply high though interpretation phonons using second quantization techniques the derived hamiltonian looks like the classical hamiltonian but interpreted operator then describes quantum field theory interacting bosons this leads new according the energy spectrum this hamiltonian easily obtained the method ladder similar the quantum harmonic

application the creation operator secondly each phonon collective caused the motion every atom the this may seen from the fact that the ladder operators contain sums over the position and momentum operators every citation needed not priori obvious that these excitations generated the operators are literally waves lattice but one may convince oneself this calculating the position position correlation function citation needed let denote state with single quantum mode excited one can show for any two atoms and which exactly what would expect according for lattice wave with frequency and wave number citation needed three dimensions the hamiltonian has the form citation needed acoustic and optical phonons solids with more than one type atom either with different masses bonding strengths the smallest unit cell exhibit two types acoustic phonons and optical acoustic phonons are coherent movements atoms the lattice out their equilibrium the displacement the direction then some areas the atoms will others farther sound wave air hence the name displacement perpendicular the propagation direction comparable waves the wavelength acoustic phonons goes this corresponds simple displacement the whole and this costs zero acoustic phonons exhibit linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long the frequencies acoustic phonons tend zero with longer longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons are often abbreviated and respectively optical phonons are phase movement the atoms the one atom moving the and its neighbour the this occurs the lattice made atoms different charge they are called optical because ionic such sodium chloride they are excited infrared radiation the electric field the light will move every positive sodium ion the direction the and every negative chloride ion the other sending the crystal optical phonons have zero frequency the brillouin zone center and show dispersion near that long wavelength this because they correspond mode vibration where positive and negative ions adjacent lattice sites swing against each creating varying electrical dipole moment optical phonons that interact this way with light are called infrared active optical phonons that are raman active can also interact indirectly with through raman scattering optical phonons are often abbreviated and for the longitudinal and transverse modes when measuring optical phonon energy optical phonon are often given units which are the same units the this value corresponds the inverse the wavelength photon with the same energy the measured the unit energy used frequently the dispersion relations both acoustic and optical see units energy for more details and crystal momentum crystal momentum tempting treat phonon with wave vector though has momentum analogy photons and matter waves this not entirely for not actually physical called the crystal momentum pseudomomentum this because only determined addition constant vectors the reciprocal lattice vectors and integer multiples for our dimensional the normal coordinates and are defined that where for any integer phonon with wave number thus equivalent infinite family phonons with wave numbers and physically the reciprocal lattice vectors act additional chunks momentum which the lattice can impart the bloch electrons obey similar set usually convenient consider phonon wave vectors which have the smallest magnitude their family the set all such wave vectors defines the first brillouin zone additional brillouin zones may defined copies the first shifted some reciprocal lattice interesting that similar consideration needed analog digital conversion where aliasing may occur under certain thermodynamics the thermodynamic properties solid are

this similarity not for turns out that the electromagnetic field behaves like set harmonic see black body radiation both gases obey the bose einstein statistics thermal equilibrium and within the harmonic the probability finding phonons given state with given angular frequency citation needed where the frequency the phonons the boltzmann constant and the operator formalism the phonon hamiltonian given terms the these are given expressing the hamiltonian operator have not taken into account the term since take infinite lattice for that matter the terms will add giving hence renormalized putting the factor arguing that the difference energy what measure and not the absolute value hence the factor absent the operator formalised expression for the hamiltonian the ground state also called the vacuum the state composed hence the energy the ground state when system state say there are phonons type the are called the occupation number the energy single phonon type being the total energy general phonon system given other the phonons are the action creation and annihilation operators are given creates phonon type while annihilates hence they are respectively the
