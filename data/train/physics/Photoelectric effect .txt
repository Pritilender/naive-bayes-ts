physics	photoelectric effect navigation search thomson scattering compton scattering pair production the photoelectric effect the observation that many metals emit electrons when light shines upon electrons emitted this manner may called photoelectrons according classical electromagnetic theory this effect can attributed the transfer energy from the light electron the from this alteration either the amplitude wavelength light would induce changes the rate emission electrons from the furthermore according this sufficiently dim light would expected show lag time between the initial shining its light and the subsequent emission however the experimental results did not correlate with either the two predictions made this instead turns electrons are only dislodged the photoelectric effect light reaches exceeds threshold frequency below which electrons can emitted from the metal regardless the amplitude and temporal length exposure make sense the fact that light can eject electrons even its intensity albert einstein proposed that beam light not wave propagating through but rather collection discrete wave packets each with energy this shed light max planck previous

photons light beam have characteristic energy proportional the frequency the the photoemission electron within some material absorbs the energy one photon and acquires more energy than the work function the electron binding the the photon energy too the electron unable escape the since increase the intensity frequency light will only increase the number energy photons sent over given interval this change intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy dislodge thus the energy the emitted electrons does not depend the intensity the incoming but only the energy equivalently the individual interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons can absorb energy from photons when but they usually follow all principle all the energy from one photon must absorbed and used liberate one electron from atomic else the energy the photon energy some the energy liberates the electron from the and the rest contributes the kinetic energy free experimental observations photoelectric emission the theory the photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations the emission electrons from illuminated metal for given there exists certain minimum frequency incident radiation below which photoelectrons are this frequency called the threshold frequency increasing the frequency the incident keeping the number incident photons fixed this would result proportionate increase increases the maximum kinetic energy the photoelectrons thus the stopping voltage increases the number electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results emitted electron function photon the intensity the incident radiation given frequency there effect the kinetic energy each the above the threshold the maximum kinetic energy the emitted photoelectron depends the frequency the incident but independent the intensity the incident light long the latter not too for given metal and frequency incident the rate which photoelectrons are ejected directly proportional the intensity the incident increase intensity incident beam keeping the frequency increases the magnitude the photoelectric though stopping voltage remains the the time lag between the incidence radiation and the emission photoelectron very less than second the direction distribution emitted electrons peaks the direction polarization the direction the electric the incident linearly mathematical description the maximum kinetic energy ejected electron given where the planck constant and the frequency the incident the term the work function sometimes denoted which gives the minimum energy required remove delocalised electron from the surface the the work function satisfies where the threshold frequency for the the maximum kinetic energy ejected electron then kinetic energy must have for the photoelectric effect stopping potential the relation between current and applied voltage illustrates the nature the photoelectric for light source illuminates plate and another plate electrode collects any emitted vary the potential between and and measure the current flowing the external circuit between the two the frequency and the intensity the incident radiation are the photoelectric current increases gradually with increase the positive potential the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are the photoelectric current attains saturation value and does not increase further for any increase the positive the saturation current depends the intensity but not its wavelength long exceeds the threshold apply negative potential the collector plate with respect the plate and gradually increase the photoelectric current becoming zero certain negative the negative potential the collector which the photoelectric current becomes zero called the stopping potential cut off potential for given frequency incident the stopping potential independent its for given frequency incident the stopping potential determined the maximum kinetic energy the photoelectrons that are the charge the electron and the stopping then the work done the retarding potential stopping the electron have recalling see that the stopping voltage varies linearly with frequency but depends the type for any particular there threshold frequency that must independent light observe any electron three step model the ray regime the photoelectric effect crystalline material often decomposed into three inner photoelectric effect see photodiode below clarification needed the hole left behind can give rise auger effect which visible even when the electron does not leave the molecular solids phonons are excited this step and may visible lines the final electron the inner photoeffect has dipole clarification needed the transition rules for atoms translate via the tight binding model onto the clarification needed they are similar geometry plasma oscillations that they have ballistic transport clarification needed half the electrons the some electrons are electrons escape from the material the the step electron can take multiple paths through these three all paths can interfere the sense the path integral formulation for surface states and molecules the step model does still make some sense even most atoms have multiple electrons which can scatter the one electron citation needed history when surface exposed electromagnetic radiation above certain threshold frequency typically visible light for alkali metals near ultraviolet for other and extreme ultraviolet for the radiation absorbed and electrons are light and especially violet discharges negatively electrified bodies with the production rays the same nature cathode under certain circumstances can directly ionize the first these phenomena was discovered hertz and hallwachs the second was announced first philipp lenard the violet light produce these effects may obtained from arc lamp burning sparking with induction coil between zinc cadmium the light from which very rich violet sunlight not rich violet these have been absorbed the and does not produce nearly large effect the many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action ultraviolet lists these substances will found papers schmidt and knoblauch century alexandre edmond becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect while studying the effect light electrolytic cells though not equivalent the photoelectric his work photovoltaics was instrumental showing strong relationship between light and electronic properties willoughby smith discovered photoconductivity selenium while testing the metal for its high resistance properties conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph johann elster and hans geitel students heidelberg developed the first practical photoelectric cells that could used measure the intensity elster and geitel had investigated with great success the effects produced light electrified heinrich hertz observed the photoelectric effect and the production and reception electromagnetic published these observations the journal annalen der physik his receiver consisted coil with spark gap where spark would seen upon detection electromagnetic placed the apparatus darkened box see the spark however noticed that the maximum spark length was reduced when the glass panel placed between the source electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons jumping across the when the spark length would observed decrease spark length when replaced glass with quartz does not absorb hertz concluded his months investigation and reported the results did not further pursue investigation this the discovery hertz that the incidence violet light spark gap facilitated the passage the led immediately series investigations hallwachs hoor righi and stoletow the effect and especially violet charged was proved these investigations that newly cleaned surface charged with negative rapidly loses this charge however small may when violet light falls upon the while the surface uncharged begin acquires positive charge when exposed the the negative electrification going out into the gas which the metal this positive electrification can much increased directing strong airblast against the however the zinc surface positively electrified suffers loss charge when exposed the this result has been but very careful examination the phenomenon elster and geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances due the discharge the light reflected from the zinc surface negative electrification neighbouring conductors induced the positive the negative electricity under the influence the electric field moving the positively electrified with regard the hertz effect the researches from the start showed great complexity the phenomenon photoelectric fatigue that the progressive diminution the effect observed upon fresh metallic according important research wilhelm hallwachs ozone played important part the however other elements enter such the the mode polish the etc was the time not even sure that the fatigue absent the period from february and until detailed analysis photoeffect was performed aleksandr stoletov with results published works four them comptes rendus one review physikalische revue translated from and the last work journal physique first these works stoletov invented new experimental setup which was more suitable for quantitative analysis using this discovered the direct proportionality between the intensity light and the induced photo electric current the first law photoeffect stoletov law one his other findings resulted from measurements the dependence the intensity the electric photo current the gas where found the existence optimal gas pressure corresponding maximum this property was used for creation solar cells citation needed thomson investigated ultraviolet light crookes tubes thomson deduced that the ejected particles were the same those previously found the cathode later called which called corpuscles the thomson enclosed metal plate vacuum and exposed high frequency was thought that the oscillating electromagnetic fields caused the field resonate after reaching certain caused subatomic corpuscle and current the amount this current varied with the intensity and colour the larger radiation intensity frequency would produce more citation needed century the discovery the ionization gases violet light was made philipp lenard the effect was produced across several centimeters air and made very great positive and small negative was natural interpret the did thomson hertz effect upon the solid liquid particles present the lenard observed that the energy individual emitted electrons increased with the frequency which related the color the this appeared odds with wave theory light which predicted that the electron energy would proportional the intensity the lenard observed the variation electron energy with light frequency using powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him investigate large changes and that had sufficient power enable him investigate the variation potential with light his experiment directly measured not electron kinetic found the electron energy relating the maximum stopping potential found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy determined the frequency the for increase frequency results increase the maximum kinetic energy calculated for electron upon liberation ultraviolet radiation would require higher applied stopping potential stop current phototube than blue however results were qualitative rather than quantitative because the difficulty performing the the experiments needed done freshly cut metal that the pure metal was but oxidised matter minutes even the partial vacuums the current emitted the surface was determined the doubling the intensity the light doubled the number electrons emitted from the the researches langevin and those eugene bloch have shown that the greater part the lenard effect certainly due this hertz the lenard effect upon the gas clarification needed itself nevertheless does refound thomson and then more decisively frederic was studied and showed very different characteristics than those first attributed albert einstein solved this apparent paradox describing light composed discrete now called photons rather than continuous based upon max planck theory black body radiation einstein theorized that the energy each quantum light was equal the frequency multiplied later called planck constant photon above threshold frequency has the required energy eject single creating the observed this discovery led the quantum revolution physics and earned einstein the nobel prize physics particle duality the effect can analyzed purely terms waves though not annus mirabilis papers albert einstein mathematical description how the photoelectric effect was caused absorption quanta light was one his papers named heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation light this paper proposed the simple description light and showed how they explained such phenomena the photoelectric his simple explanation terms absorption discrete quanta light explained the features the phenomenon and the characteristic the idea light quanta began with max published law black body radiation the law distribution energy the normal spectrum assuming that hertzian oscillators could only exist energies proportional the frequency the oscillator where assuming that light actually consisted discrete energy einstein wrote equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental explained why the energy photoelectrons was dependent only the frequency the incident light and not its intensity high frequency source could supply few high energy whereas low frequency source would supply photons sufficient individual energy dislodge any this was enormous theoretical but the concept was strongly resisted first because contradicted the wave theory light that followed naturally from james clerk maxwell equations for electromagnetic and more the assumption infinite divisibility energy physical even after experiments showed that equations for the photoelectric effect were resistance the idea photons since appeared contradict which were understood and einstein work predicted that the energy individual ejected electrons increases linearly with the frequency the perhaps the precise relationship had not that time been was known that the energy photoelectrons increases with increasing frequency incident light and independent the intensity the however the manner the increase was not experimentally determined until when robert andrews millikan showed that prediction was the photoelectric effect helped propel the emerging concept wave particle duality the nature light light simultaneously possesses the characteristics both waves and each being manifested according the the effect was impossible understand terms the classical wave description the energy the emitted electrons did not depend the intensity the incident classical theory predicted that the electrons would gather energy over period and then uses and effects photomultipliers photomultiplier these are extremely sensitive vacuum tubes with photocathode coated onto part end the inside the the photocathode contains combinations materials such rubidium and antimony specially selected provide low work when illuminated even very low levels the photocathode readily releases means series electrodes higher these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased number through secondary emission provide readily detectable output

metal cap spreads the stem and the gold leaf the because they then have the same the stem and leaf repel each this will cause the leaf bend away from the the electroscope important tool illustrating the photoelectric for the electroscope negatively charged there excess electrons and the leaf separated from the frequency light shines the the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall this because the frequency the light shining the cap above the threshold the photons the light have enough energy liberate electrons from the reducing its negative this will discharge negatively charged electroscope and further charge positive however the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have high enough frequency its frequency below the threshold value for the then the leaf
