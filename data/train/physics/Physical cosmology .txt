the big bang theory best explains dramatic advances observational cosmology since the including the cosmic microwave background distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys have led the development

theory and albert einstein published his theory general relativity which provided unified description gravity geometric property space and the einstein believed static universe but found that his original formulation the theory did not permit this because masses distributed throughout the universe gravitationally and move toward each other over however realized that his equations permitted the introduction constant term which could counteract the attractive force gravity the cosmic einstein published his first paper relativistic cosmology which added this cosmological constant his field equations order force them model static however this called einstein model unstable small will eventually start expand the einstein model describes static space finite and unbounded analogous the surface which has finite area but was later realized that model was just one larger set all which were consistent with general relativity and the cosmological the cosmological solutions general relativity were found alexander friedmann the early his equations describe the friedmann walker universe which may expand and whose geometry may flat universe gravitational waves cosmic inflation light big bang the vesto slipher and later carl wilhelm wirtz interpreted the red shift spiral nebulae doppler shift that indicated they were receding from however difficult determine the distance astronomical one way compare the physical size object its angular size but physical size must assumed another method measure the brightness object and assume intrinsic luminosity from which the distance may determined using the inverse square law due the difficulty using these they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own milky way nor did they speculate about the cosmological the belgian roman catholic priest georges tre independently derived the walker equations and the basis the recession spiral that the universe began with the explosion primeval atom which was later called the big bang edwin hubble provided observational basis for hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies determining their distances using measurements the brightness cepheid variable stars discovered relationship between the redshift galaxy and its interpreted this evidence that the galaxies are receding from earth every direction speeds proportional their this fact now known hubble law though the numerical factor hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off factor due not knowing about the types cepheid given the cosmological principle hubble law suggested that the universe was two primary explanations were proposed for the one was big bang advocated and developed george the other explanation was fred hoyle steady state model which new matter created the galaxies move away from each this the universe roughly the same any point for number support for these theories was evenly however the observational evidence began support the idea that the universe evolved from hot dense the discovery the cosmic microwave background lent strong support the big bang and since the precise measurements the cosmic microwave background the cosmic background explorer the early few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories the origin and evolution the one consequence this that standard general the universe began with singularity demonstrated roger penrose and stephen hawking the energy the cosmos light chemical elements primarily hydrogen and helium were created the big bang process see nucleosynthesis the small atomic nuclei combined into larger atomic nuclei form heavier elements such iron and nickel which are more stable see nuclear fusion this caused later energy release such reactions nuclear particles inside stars continue contribute sudden energy releases such nova stars gravitational collapse matter into black holes also thought power the most energetic generally seen the centers galaxies see quasar and active galaxy cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena such those related the accelerating expansion the universe using conventional forms energy instead cosmologists propose new form energy called dark energy that permeates all one hypothesis that dark energy the energy virtual particles which are believed exist vacuum due the uncertainty principle there clear way define the total energy the universe using the most widely accepted theory general relativity therefore remains controversial whether the total energy conserved expanding for each photon that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due the redshift effect this energy not obviously transferred any other seems permanently the other some cosmologists insist that energy conserved some this follows the law conservation energy thermodynamics the universe field study that explores which form energy dominates the cosmos relativistic particles which are referred radiation relativistic particles referred relativistic particles are particles whose rest mass zero negligible compared their kinetic energy and move the speed light very close non relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and move much slower than the speed the universe both matter and radiation become however the universe also cools meaning that the average energy per particle gets therefore radiation becomes and dilutes faster than thus with the expansion the radiation becomes less dominant than the very early universe said have been radiation and radiation controlled the deceleration later the average energy per photon becomes roughly and matter dictates the rate deceleration and the universe said matter the intermediate case not treated well analytically the expansion the universe matter dilutes even further and the cosmological constant becomes leading acceleration the history the universe timeline the big bang the history the universe central issue the history the universe divided into different periods called according the dominant forces and processes each the standard cosmological model known the lambda cdm model equations motion friedmann walker metric the equations motion governing the universe whole are derived from general relativity with positive cosmological constant the solution expanding due this the radiation and matter the universe cool down and become the expansion slowed down gravitation attracting the radiation and matter the however these become the cosmological constant becomes more dominant and the expansion the universe starts accelerate rather than our universe this happened billions years particle physics cosmology particle physics cosmology particle physics important the behavior the early because the early universe was hot that the average energy density was very because scattering processes and decay unstable particles are important rule scattering decay process cosmologically important certain cosmological epoch the time scale describing that process smaller comparable the time scale the expansion the the time scale that describes the expansion the universe with being the hubble constant which itself actually varies with the expansion timescale roughly equal the age the universe that timeline the big bang timeline the big bang observations suggest that the universe began around billion years since the evolution the universe has passed through three the very early which still poorly was the split second which the universe was hot that particles had energies higher than those currently accessible particle accelerators therefore while the basic features this epoch have been worked out the big bang the details are largely based educated following the early the evolution the universe proceeded according known high energy physics this when the first electrons and neutrons then nuclei and finally with the formation neutral the cosmic microwave background was finally the epoch structure formation when matter started aggregate into the first stars and quasars and ultimately clusters galaxies and superclusters formed the future the universe not yet firmly but according the cdm model will continue expanding areas study below some the most active areas inquiry cosmology are roughly chronological this does not include all the big bang which presented timeline the big bang very early universe the hot universe appears well explained the big bang from roughly seconds but there are several problems one that there compelling using current particle for the universe flat homogeneous and isotropic see the cosmological principle moreover grand unified theories particle physics suggest that there should magnetic monopoles the which have not been these problems are resolved brief period cosmic inflation which drives the universe flatness smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities the observed and exponentially dilutes the the physical model behind cosmic inflation extremely but has not yet been confirmed particle and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and quantum field theory some cosmologists think that string theory and brane cosmology will provide alternative another major problem cosmology what caused the universe contain far more matter than antimatter cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe not split into regions matter and there would rays and gamma rays produced result annihilation but this not therefore some process the early universe must have created small excess matter over and this currently not process called baryogenesis three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived andrei sakharov and requires violation the particle physics symmetry called symmetry between matter and however particle accelerators measure too small violation symmetry account for the baryon cosmologists and particle physicists look for additional violations the symmetry the early universe that might account for the baryon both the problems baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related particle and their resolution might come from high energy theory and experiment rather than through observations the big bang nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis big bang nucleosynthesis the theory the formation the elements the early finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its temperature dropped below that which nuclear fusion could big bang nucleosynthesis had brief period during which could only the very lightest elements were starting from hydrogen ions protons principally produced deuterium helium and lithium other elements were produced only trace the basic theory nucleosynthesis was developed george gamow ralph asher alpher and robert herman was used for many years probe physics the time the big the theory big bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances primordial light elements with the features the early specifically can used test the equivalence principle probe dark matter and test neutrino physics some cosmologists have proposed that big bang nucleosynthesis suggests there fourth sterile species cosmic microwave background cosmic microwave background gravitational waves infant universe focal plane radio telescope the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from decoupling after the epoch recombination when neutral atoms first this radiation produced the big bang stopped thomson scattering from charged the first observed arno penzias and robert woodrow wilson has perfect thermal black body spectrum has temperature kelvins today and isotropic one part cosmological perturbation theory which describes the evolution slight inhomogeneities the early has allowed cosmologists precisely calculate the angular power spectrum the and has been measured the recent satellite experiments cobe and wmap and many ground and based experiments such degree angular scale interferometer cosmic background imager and boomerang one the goals these efforts measure the basic parameters the lambda cdm model with increasing well test the predictions the big bang model and look for new the recent measurements made for have placed limits the neutrino newer such quiet and the atacama cosmology telescope are trying measure the polarization the cosmic microwave these measurements are expected provide further confirmation the theory well information about cosmic and the called secondary such the sunyaev dovich effect and sachs wolfe effect which are caused interaction between galaxies and clusters with the cosmic microwave march astronomers the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics announced the apparent detection gravitational waves which may provide strong evidence for inflation and the big bang however june lowered confidence confirming the cosmic inflation findings was formation and evolution scale structure large scale structure the cosmos structure formation galaxy formation and evolution understanding the formation and evolution the largest and earliest structures quasars galaxies clusters and superclusters one the largest efforts cosmologists study model hierarchical structure formation which structures form from the bottom with smaller objects forming while the largest such are still one way study structure the universe survey the visible order construct dimensional picture the galaxies the universe and measure the matter power spectrum this the approach the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy redshift survey another tool for understanding structure formation which cosmologists use study the gravitational aggregation matter the clusters into filaments superclusters and voids most simulations contain only baryonic cold dark matter which should suffice understand the universe the largest there much more dark matter the universe than baryonic more advanced simulations are starting include baryons and study the formation individual cosmologists study these simulations see they agree with the galaxy and understand any other complementary observations measure the distribution matter the distant universe and probe reionization include the lyman alpha forest which allows cosmologists measure the distribution neutral atomic hydrogen gas the early measuring the absorption light from distant quasars the the centimeter absorption line neutral atomic hydrogen also provides sensitive test cosmology weak lensing the distortion distant image gravitational lensing due dark these will help cosmologists settle the question when and how structure formed the dark matter dark matter evidence from big bang nucleosynthesis the cosmic microwave background and structure formation suggests that about the mass the universe consists baryonic dark whereas only consists baryonic matter the gravitational effects dark matter are well behaves like non radiative fluid that forms haloes around dark matter has never been detected the and the particle physics nature dark matter remains completely without observational there are number such stable supersymmetric particle weakly interacting massive particle axion and massive compact halo object alternatives the dark matter hypothesis include modification gravity small accelerations mond effect from brane cosmology dark energy dark energy the universe flat there must additional component making addition the dark matter and baryons the energy density the this called dark order not interfere with big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave must not cluster haloes like baryons and dark there strong observational evidence for dark the total energy density the universe known through constraints the flatness the but the amount clustering matter tightly and much less than the case for dark energy was strengthened when measurements demonstrated that the expansion the universe has begun gradually apart from its density and its clustering nothing known about dark quantum field theory predicts cosmological constant much like dark but orders magnitude larger than that steven weinberg and number string theorists see string landscape have invoked the weak anthropic principle the reason that physicists observe universe with such small cosmological constant that physicists any could exist universe with larger cosmological many cosmologists find this unsatisfying perhaps because while the weak anthropic principle evident given that living observers there must least one universe with cosmological constant which allows for life does not attempt explain the context that for the weak anthropic principle alone does not distinguish only one universe will ever exist and there some underlying principle that constrains the the value only one universe will ever exist and although there underlying principle fixing the got lots universes exist simultaneously with range and course ours one the supporting other possible explanations for dark energy include quintessence modification gravity the largest the effect cosmology the dark energy that these models describe given the dark equation state which varies depending upon the the nature dark energy one the most challenging problems better understanding dark energy likely solve the problem the ultimate fate the universe the current cosmological the accelerated expansion due dark energy preventing structures larger than superclusters from not known whether the acceleration will continue perhaps even increasing until big rip whether will eventually other areas inquiry cosmologists also whether primordial black holes were formed our and what happened the gzk cutoff for energy cosmic and whether signals failure special relativity high energies the equivalence principle whether not general theory relativity the correct theory
