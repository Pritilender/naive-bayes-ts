physics	physical law laws physics navigation search laws science physical law scientific according the oxford english theoretical principle deduced from particular applicable defined group class phenomena and expressible the statement that particular phenomenon always occurs certain conditions physical laws are typically conclusions based repeated scientific experiments and observations over many years and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community the production summary description our environment the form such laws fundamental aim these terms are not used the same way all the distinction between natural law the legal sense and law nature physical law the scientific sense modern both concepts being equally derived from physis the greek word translated into latin natura for nature contents description examples laws definitions laws being consequences mathematical symmetries laws approximations physical laws derived from symmetry principles history other fields see also notes references external links description several general properties physical laws have been identified see davies and feynman although each the characterizations are not necessarily original physical laws true least within their regime there have never been repeatable contradicting universal they appear apply everywhere the simple they are typically expressed terms single mathematical absolute nothing the universe appears affect stable unchanged since first discovered although they may have been shown approximations more accurate see laws approximations below omnipotent everything the universe apparently must comply with them according generally conservative often expressions existing homogeneities symmetries space and typically theoretically reversible time quantum although time itself irreversible physical laws are distinguished from scientific theories their scientific theories are generally more complex than they have many component and are more likely changed the body available experimental data and analysis this because physical law summary observation strictly empirical whereas theory model that accounts for the explains relates other and makes testable predictions based upon simply while law notes that something theory explains why and how something examples list laws science scientific laws named after people some the more famous laws nature are found isaac newton theories classical mechanics presented his philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica and albert einstein theory relativity other examples laws nature include boyle law conservation laws the four laws thermodynamics etc laws definitions some scientific appear mathematical definitions newton second law the uncertainty principle the principle least action causality while these scientific explain what our senses they are still empirical thus they are not mathematical facts reference law often suggests fact although facts not exist scientifically priori laws being consequences mathematical symmetries other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found nature pauli exclusion principle reflects identity conservation laws reflect homogeneity space time lorentz transformations reflect rotational symmetry space time laws are constantly being checked experimentally higher and higher degrees this one the main goals the fact that laws have never been seen violated does not preclude testing them increased accuracy new kinds conditions confirm whether they continue whether they and what can discovered the always possible for laws invalidated proven have repeatable experimental should any however fundamental changes the laws are extremely since this would imply change experimental facts they were derived from the first well established laws have indeed been invalidated some special but the new formulations created explain the discrepancies can said generalize rather than the that the invalidated laws have been found only close approximations see which other terms factors must added cover previously for very large very small scales time enormous speeds etc thus rather than unchanging physical laws are better viewed series improving and more precise laws approximations some laws are only approximations other more general and are good approximations with restricted domain for newtonian dynamics which based galilean the low speed limit special relativity since the galilean transformation the speed approximation the lorentz similarly the newtonian gravitation law mass approximation general and law approximation quantum electrodynamics large distances compared the range weak such cases common use the approximate versions the instead the more accurate general physical laws derived from symmetry principles many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences various symmetries time other aspects specifically noether theorem connects some conservation laws certain for conservation energy consequence the shift symmetry time moment time different from any while conservation momentum consequence the symmetry space place space different than any the indistinguishability all particles each fundamental type electrons results the dirac and bose quantum statistics which turn result the pauli exclusion principle for fermions and bose einstein condensation for bosons the rotational symmetry between time and space coordinate axes when one taken another results lorentz transformations which turn result special relativity theory symmetry between inertial and gravitational mass results general relativity the inverse square law interactions mediated massless bosons the mathematical consequence the dimensionality space one strategy the search for the most fundamental laws nature search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can applied the fundamental history compared pre modern accounts causality laws nature fill the role played divine causality the one and accounts such plato theory forms the the observation that there are underlying regularities nature dates prehistoric times since the recognition effect relationships implicit recognition that there are laws the recognition such regularities independent scientific laws per though was limited their entanglement animism and the attribution many effects that not have readily obvious such meteorological astronomical and biological phenomena the actions various gods spirits supernatural beings etc observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound with metaphysics and systematic theorizing about nature physis began with the early greek philosophers and scientists and continued into the hellenistic and roman imperial periods during which times the intellectual influence roman law increasingly became the formula law first appears live favored latin poets lucretius virgil ovid manilius time gaining firm theoretical presence the prose treatises seneca and pliny why this roman according historian and classicist lehoux persuasive the idea was made possible the pivotal role codified law and forensic argument roman life and for the romans the place par excellence where law nature religion and politics overlap the law when read natural questions and watch again and again just how applies standards witness argument and can recognize that are reading one the great roman rhetoricians the thoroughly immersed forensic and not seneca legal models scientific judgment turn all over the and for example prove equally integral ptolemy approach where the mind assigned the role the senses that disclosure and dialectical reason that the law the precise formulation what are now recognized modern and valid statements the laws nature dates from the century with the beginning accurate experimentation and development advanced form the modern scientific method which took shape this time with francis bacon and galileo aimed total separation science from with minimal speculation about metaphysics and natural law the political conceived universal divorced from sectarian religion and accidents was also elaborated this period grotius spinoza and hobbes name other fields some mathematical theorems and axioms are referred laws because they provide logical foundation empirical examples other observed phenomena sometimes described laws include the titius bode law planetary zipf law moore law technological many these laws fall within the scope uncomfortable science other laws are pragmatic and such the law unintended consequences principles other fields study are sometimes loosely referred laws these include occam razor principle philosophy and the pareto principle see also philosophy science scientific method inductive reasoning physical constant laws
