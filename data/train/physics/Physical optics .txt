physical optics navigation search diffraction physics physical optics wave optics the branch optics which studies interference diffraction polarization and other phenomena for which the ray approximation geometric optics not this usage tends not include effects such quantum noise optical communication which studied the branch coherence theory the physical optics approximation physical optics also the name approximation commonly used electrical engineering and applied physics this intermediate method between geometric optics which ignores wave effects and full wave electromagnetism which precise theory the word physical means that more physical than geometric ray optics and not that exact physical this approximation consists using ray optics estimate the field surface and then integrating that field over the surface calculate the transmitted scattered this resembles the born approximation that the details the problem are treated perturbation standard way estimating diffraction radio this approximation used estimate some effects that resemble optical models several diffraction and polarization effects but not the dependence diffraction since high frequency often more accurate optics than for typically consists integrating ray estimated field over mirror aperture calculate the transmitted scattered radar scattering usually means taking the current that would found tangent plane similar material the current each point the the geometrically illuminated scatterer current the shadowed parts taken the approximate scattered field then obtained integral over these approximate this useful for bodies with large smooth convex shapes and for lossy low surfaces the ray optics field current generally not accurate near edges shadow unless supplemented diffraction and creeping wave calculations the standard theory physical optics has some defects the evaluation scattered leading decreased accuracy away from the specular improved theory introduced gives exact solutions problems involving wave diffraction conducting see also electromagnetic modeling history optics negative index metamaterials
