tai wanderers from which word planet was ancient greece china babylon and indeed all modern was almost universally believed that earth was the center the universe and that all the planets circled the reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared revolve around earth each day and the apparently common sense perceptions that earth was solid and stable and that was not moving but babylon babylonian astronomy the first civilization known possess functional theory the planets were the babylonians who lived mesopotamia the first and second millennia the oldest surviving planetary

dating from the century that lays out the motions the moon and planets over the course the the babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations what would eventually become western astrology the enuma anu enlil written during the neo assyrian period the century comprises list omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions the venus mercury and the outer planets mars jupiter and saturn were all identified babylonian astronomers these would remain the only known planets until the invention the telescope early modern greco roman astronomy greek astronomy the ancient greeks initially did not attach much significance the planets the the pythagoreans the and centuries appear have developed their own independent planetary which consisted the sun moon and

corresponding latin venus the century aristarchus samos proposed heliocentric system according which earth and the planets revolved around the however the geocentric system would remain dominant until the scientific revolution the century during the hellenistic period the greeks had begun develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions the these which were based geometry rather than the arithmetic the would eventually eclipse the theories complexity and and account for most the astronomical movements observed from earth with the naked these theories would reach their fullest

planets black spots the face the which was later identified transit mercury and venus the maragha astronomer qotb din shirazi the however ibn bajjah could not have observed transit none occurred his european renaissance and heliocentrism with the advent the scientific revolution understanding the term planet changed from something that moved across the sky relation the star field body that orbited earth that were believed the and the century something that directly orbited the sun when the heliocentric model copernicus galileo and kepler gained thus earth became included the list whereas the sun and moon were when the first satellites jupiter and saturn were discovered the the terms planet and satellite were used interchangeably although the latter would gradually become more prevalent the following until the the number planets rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the sun was listed planet the scientific century the century astronomers began realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified planets for almost half century such ceres pallas and vesta were very different from the traditional these bodies shared the same region space between mars and jupiter the asteroid belt and had much smaller result they were reclassified asteroids the absence any formal planet came understood any large body that orbited the because there was dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the and the spate new discoveries seemed have ended after the discovery neptune there was apparent need have formal century the pluto was after initial observations led the belief was larger than the object was immediately accepted the ninth further monitoring found the body was actually much raymond lyttleton suggested that pluto may escaped satellite neptune and fred whipple suggested that pluto may however was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within larger kept its status until astronomers aleksander wolszczan and dale frail announced the discovery planets around pulsar psr this discovery generally considered the first definitive detection planetary system around another then october michel mayor and didier queloz the university geneva announced the first definitive detection exoplanet orbiting ordinary main sequence star pegasi the discovery extrasolar planets led another ambiguity defining the point which planet becomes many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass approaching that stellar objects known brown dwarfs brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due their ability fuse deuterium heavier isotope hydrogen although objects more massive than times that jupiter fuse objects only jupiter masses can fuse however deuterium quite and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive century with the discovery during the latter half the century more objects within the solar system and large objects around other disputes arose over what should constitute there were particular disagreements over whether object should considered planet was part distinct population such belt was large enough generate energy the thermonuclear fusion deuterium growing number astronomers argued for pluto declassified because many similar objects approaching its size had been found the same region the solar system the kuiper belt during the and early pluto was found just one small body population some them including quaoar sedna and eris were heralded the popular press the tenth planet failing however receive widespread scientific the announcement eris object more massive than created the necessity and public desire for official definition acknowledging the the iau set about creating the definition planet and produced one august the number planets dropped the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and and new class dwarf planets was initially containing three objects ceres pluto and eris extrasolar planet definition the international astronomical union working group extrasolar planets made position statement the definition planet that incorporated the following working mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion deuterium currently calculated times the mass jupiter for objects with the same isotopic abundance the sun that orbit stars stellar remnants are planets matter how they the minimum mass and size required for extrasolar object considered planet should the same that used the solar substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion deuterium are brown dwarfs matter how they formed where they are free floating objects young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion deuterium are not planets but are brown whatever name most this definition has since been widely used astronomers when publishing discoveries exoplanets academic journals although remains effective working definition until more permanent one formally however does not address the dispute over the lower mass and steered clear the controversy regarding objects within the solar this definition also makes comment the planetary status objects orbiting brown such one definition sub brown dwarf mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion this formation distinction between brown dwarf and planet not universally agreed astronomers are divided into two camps whether consider the formation process planet part its division one reason for the dissent that often may not possible determine the formation for planet formed accretion around star may get ejected from the system become and likewise brown dwarf that formed its own star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around the jupiter mass cutoff rule thumb rather than something precise physical the question what meant deuterium burning this question arises because large objects will burn most their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only and the value somewhere the amount deuterium burnt depends not only mass but also the composition the the amount helium and deuterium present the extrasolar planets encyclopaedia includes objects jupiter saying the fact that there special feature around the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice forget this mass the exoplanet data explorer includes objects jupiter masses with the the jupiter mass distinction the iau working group physically unmotivated for planets with rocky and observationally problematic due the sin the nasa exoplanet archive includes objects with mass minimum equal less than jupiter another criterion for separating planets and brown rather than deuterium formation process whether the core pressure dominated coulomb pressure electron degeneracy pressure definition iau definition planet the matter the lower limit was addressed during the meeting the iau general assembly after much debate and one failed the assembly voted pass resolution that defined planets within the solar system celestial body that orbit around the has sufficient mass for its gravity overcome rigid body forces that assumes hydrostatic equilibrium nearly shape and has cleared the neighbourhood around its under this the solar system considered have eight bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third such pluto and are classified dwarf planets provided they are not also natural satellites other originally iau committee had proposed definition that would have included much larger number planets did not include after much was decided via vote that those bodies should instead classified dwarf this definition based theories planetary which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood other smaller described astronomer steven soter the end product secondary disk accretion small number relatively large bodies either intersecting resonant which prevent collisions between minor planets and including kbos kuiper belt differ from planets that they can collide with each other and with beyond the scientific pluto has held strong cultural significance for many the general public considering its planetary status after its discovery the discovery eris was widely reported the media the tenth planet and therefore the reclassification all three objects dwarf planets has attracted lot media and public attention objects formerly

moons mythology and naming weekday names eye planet olympus the names for the planets the western world are derived from the naming practices the which ultimately derive from those the greeks and the ancient greece the two great luminaries the sun and the moon were called helios and selene the farthest planet was called phainon the followed phaethon bright the red planet was known pyroeis the fiery the brightest was known phosphoros the light and the fleeting final planet was called stilbon the the greeks also made each planet sacred one among their pantheon the olympians helios and selene were the names both planets and phainon was sacred cronus the titan who fathered the phaethon was sacred zeus cronus son who deposed him pyroeis was given ares son zeus and god phosphoros was ruled aphrodite the goddess and hermes messenger the gods and god learning and ruled over the greek practice grafting their names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the the babylonians named phosphoros after their goddess ishtar pyroeis after their god nergal stilbon after their god wisdom nabu and phaethon after their chief marduk there are too many concordances between greek and babylonian naming conventions for them have arisen the translation was not for the babylonian nergal was god and thus the greeks identified him with however unlike nergal was also god pestilence and the today most people the western world know the planets names derived from the olympian pantheon although modern greeks still use their ancient names for the other european because the influence the roman empire and later the catholic church use the roman names rather than the greek the who like the were indo europeans shared with them common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that greek poetic culture had given their gods during the later period the roman republic roman writers borrowed much the greek narratives and applied them their own the point where they became virtually when the romans studied greek they gave the planets their own names mercurius for venus mars iuppiter and saturnus when subsequent planets were discovered the and the naming practice was retained with nept nus poseidon uranus unique that named for greek deity rather than his roman counterpart some romans following belief possibly originating mesopotamia but developed hellenistic egypt believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts looking after affairs the order shifts went jupiter mars sun venus mercury moon from the farthest the closest therefore the first day was started saturn second day sun followed moon mars mercury jupiter and because each day was named the god that started this also the order the days the week the roman calendar after the nundinal cycle was rejected and still preserved many modern saturday sunday and monday are straightforward translations these roman the other days were renamed after tiw den thunor and the anglo saxon gods considered similar equivalent mercury jupiter and respectively earth the only planet whose name english not derived from roman because was only generally accepted planet the there tradition naming after the same english the sun and the though they are longer generally considered the name originates from the century anglo saxon word erda which means ground soil and was first used writing the name the sphere earth perhaps around with its equivalents the other germanic languages derives ultimately from the proto germanic word ertho ground can seen the english earth the german erde the dutch aarde and the scandinavian jord many the romance languages retain the old roman word terra some variation that was used with the meaning dry opposed sea

additional material their gravitational these concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity form protoplanets after planet reaches diameter larger than the begins

typical expectations for these include dwarf planets the larger moons and floating which may have been ejected from system rogue planets formed through collapse rather than accretion sometimes called sub brown dwarfs rogue planets rogue planet several computer simulations stellar and planetary system formation have suggested that some objects planetary mass would ejected into interstellar space

planets except mercury have substantial atmospheres their large masses mean gravity strong enough keep gases close the the larger gas giants are massive enough keep large amounts the light gases
