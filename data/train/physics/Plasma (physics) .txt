nanomaterials mathematical descriptions birkeland current plasma modeling completely describe the state would need write down all the particle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic field the plasma however generally not practical necessary keep track all the particles therefore plasma physicists commonly use less detailed which there are two main fluid model fluid models describe plasmas terms smoothed like density and averaged velocity around each position see plasma parameters one simple fluid magnetohydrodynamics treats the plasma single fluid governed combination maxwell equations and the navier stokes equations more general description the two fluid plasma picture where the ions and electrons are described fluid models are often accurate when collisionality sufficiently high keep the plasma velocity distribution close maxwell boltzmann distribution because fluid models usually describe the plasma terms single flow certain temperature each spatial they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams double layers nor resolve particle kinetic model kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function each point the plasma and therefore not need assume maxwell boltzmann distribution kinetic description often necessary for collisionless there are two common approaches kinetic description one based representing the smoothed distribution function grid velocity and the known the particle cell technique includes kinetic information following the trajectories large number individual kinetic models are generally more
