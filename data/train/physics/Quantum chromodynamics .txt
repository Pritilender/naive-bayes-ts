body experimental evidence for qcd has been gathered over the qcd enjoys two peculiar confinement which means that the force between quarks does not diminish they are because when you split the quark the energy enough create another quark thus creating another quark they are forever bound into hadrons such the proton and the neutron the pion and although analytically confinement widely believed true because explains the consistent failure free quark searches and easy demonstrate lattice qcd asymptotic freedom which means that very energy quarks and gluons interact very weakly creating gluon

further reading external links terminology the word quark was coined american physicist murray mann its present originally comes from the phrase three quarks for muster finnegans wake james joyce june gell mann wrote private letter the editor the oxford english dictionary which related that had been influenced the allusion three quarks seemed only three quarks had been gell however wanted pronounce the word with not joyce seemed indicate rhyming words the vicinity such mark gell mann got around that supposing that one ingredient the line three quarks for muster was cry three quarts for mister heard earwicker plausible suggestion given the complex punning the three kinds charge qcd opposed one quantum electrodynamics are usually referred color charge loose analogy the three kinds color green and perceived humans other than this the quantum parameter color completely unrelated the familiar phenomenon since the theory electric charge dubbed electrodynamics the greek word chroma meaning applied the theory color chromodynamics history with the invention bubble chambers and spark chambers the experimental particle physics discovered large and growing number particles called hadrons seemed that such large number particles could not all fundamental first the particles were classified charge and isospin eugene wigner and werner heisenberg then according strangeness murray mann and kazuhiko nishijima gain greater the hadrons were sorted into groups having similar properties and masses using the eightfold way invented mann and yuval eman gell mann and george zweig correcting earlier approach shoichi sakata went propose that the structure the groups could explained the existence three flavors smaller particles inside the the quarks perhaps the first remark that quarks should possess additional quantum number was made short footnote the preprint boris struminsky connection with hyperon composed three strange quarks with parallel spins this situation was because since quarks are fermions such combination forbidden the pauli exclusion principle three identical quarks cannot form antisymmetric order realize antisymmetric orbital necessary for the quark have additional quantum struminsky magnetic moments barions the quark model jinr preprint dubna submitted january boris struminsky was phd student nikolay bogolyubov the problem considered this preprint was suggested nikolay who advised boris struminsky this the beginning nikolay bogolyubov boris struminsky and albert tavkhelidze wrote preprint with more detailed discussion the additional quark quantum degree this work was also presented albert tavchelidze without obtaining consent his collaborators for doing international conference trieste may similar mysterious situation was with the baryon the quark composed three quarks with parallel moo young han with yoichiro nambu and oscar greenberg independently resolved the problem proposing that quarks possess additional gauge degree freedom later called color han and nambu noted that quarks might interact via octet vector gauge bosons the gluons since free quark searches consistently failed turn any evidence for the new and because elementary particle back then was defined particle which could separated and gell mann often said that quarks were merely convenient mathematical not real the meaning this statement was usually clear meant quarks are but also was implying that the strong interactions could probably not fully described quantum field richard feynman argued that high energy experiments showed quarks are real called them partons since they were parts feynman meant objects which travel along elementary particles field the difference between and approaches reflected deep split the theoretical physics feynman thought the quarks have distribution position like any other and believed that the diffusion parton momentum explained diffractive scattering although mann believed that certain quark charges could was open the possibility that the quarks themselves could not localized because space and time break this was the more radical approach matrix theory james bjorken proposed that pointlike partons would imply certain relations should hold deep inelastic scattering electrons and which were spectacularly verified experiments slac this led physicists abandon the matrix approach for the strong the discovery asymptotic freedom the strong interactions david gross david politzer and frank wilczek allowed physicists make precise predictions the results many high energy experiments using the quantum field theory technique perturbation theory evidence gluons was discovered three jet events petra these experiments became more and more culminating the verification perturbative qcd the level few percent the lep cern the other side asymptotic freedom confinement since the force between color charges does not decrease with believed that quarks and gluons can never liberated from this aspect the theory verified within lattice qcd computations but not mathematically one the millennium prize problems announced the clay mathematics institute requires claimant produce such other aspects non perturbative qcd are the exploration phases quark matter including the quark gluon plasma the relation between the distance particle limit and the confining distance limit one the topics recently explored using string theory the modern form matrix theory list unsolved problems physics qcd the perturbative regime confinement the equations qcd remain unsolved energy scales relevant for describing atomic nuclei how does qcd give rise the physics nuclei and nuclear quark matter the equations qcd predict that plasma quarks and gluons should formed high temperature and what are the properties this phase matter some definitions every field theory particle physics based certain symmetries nature whose existence deduced from these can local symmetries that the symmetry acts independently each point spacetime each such symmetry the basis gauge theory and requires the introduction its own gauge bosons global symmetries which are symmetries whose operations must simultaneously applied all points qcd gauge theory the gauge group obtained taking the color charge define local since the strong interaction does not discriminate between different flavors qcd has approximate flavor symmetry which broken the differing masses the there are additional global symmetries whose definitions require the notion chirality discrimination between left and the spin particle has positive projection its direction motion then called otherwise chirality and handedness are not the but become approximately equivalent high chiral symmetries involve independent transformations these two types vector symmetries also called diagonal mean the same transformation applied the two axial symmetries are those which one transformation applied handed particles and the inverse the handed additional duality asymptotic freedom means that large energy this corresponds also short distances there practically interaction between the this contrast more precisely one would say dual what one used since usually one connects the absence interactions with large however already mentioned the original paper franz solid state theorist who introduced simple gauge invariant lattice the temperature behaviour the original model the strong decay correlations large corresponds the temperature behaviour the usually dual model namely the asymptotic decay trivial short range deviations from almost perfect for short here contrast have only the dual which that one described this symmetry groups the color group corresponds the local symmetry whose gauging gives rise the electric charge labels representation the local symmetry group which gauged give qed this abelian group one considers version qcd with flavors massless then there global chiral flavor symmetry group the chiral symmetry spontaneously broken the qcd vacuum the vector with the formation chiral condensate the vector corresponds the baryon number quarks and exact the axial symmetry exact the classical but broken the quantum occurrence called anomaly gluon field configurations called instantons are closely related this there are two different types symmetry there the symmetry that acts the different colors and this exact gauge symmetry mediated the and there also flavor symmetry which rotates different flavors quarks each flavor flavor approximate symmetry the vacuum and not fundamental symmetry accidental consequence the small mass the three lightest the qcd vacuum there are vacuum condensates all the quarks whose mass less than the qcd this includes the and down and lesser extent the strange but not any the the vacuum symmetric under isospin rotations and and lesser extent under rotations down and full flavor group and the observed particles make isospin and multiplets the approximate flavor symmetries have associated gauge observed particles like the rho and the but these particles are nothing like the gluons and they are not they are emergent gauge bosons approximate string description qcd lagrangian the dynamics the quarks and gluons are controlled the quantum chromodynamics the gauge invariant qcd lagrangian where the quark dynamical function the fundamental representation the gauge group indexed are the gluon fields also dynamical functions the adjoint representation the gauge indexed the are dirac matrices connecting the spinor representation the vector representation the lorentz group the symbol represents the gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor analogous the electromagnetic field strength tensor quantum electrodynamics given where are the structure constants note that the rules down the indexes are trivial that whereas for the indexes one has the trivial relativistic rules corresponding the metric signature the constants and control the quark mass and coupling constants the subject renormalization the full quantum important theoretical notion concerning the final term the above lagrangian the wilson loop variable this loop variable plays most important role discretized forms the qcd see lattice qcd and more distinguishes confined and deconfined states gauge was introduced the nobel prize winner kenneth wilson and treated separate fields quarks are massive fermions which carry color charge whose gauging the content quarks are represented dirac fields the fundamental representation the gauge group they also carry electric charge either and participate weak interactions part weak isospin doublets they carry global quantum numbers including the baryon number which for each hypercharge and one the flavor quantum numbers gluons are bosons which also carry color charges since they lie the adjoint representation they have electric not participate the weak and have they lie the singlet representation all these symmetry every quark has its own the charge each antiquark exactly the opposite the corresponding dynamics according the rules quantum field theory and the associated feynman diagrams the above theory gives rise three basic quark may emit gluon may emit and two gluons may directly this contrasts with qed which only the first kind interaction since photons have diagrams involving faddeev popov ghosts must considered too except the unitarity gauge area law and confinement detailed computations with the mentioned lagrangian show that the effective potential between quark and its quark meson contains term which represents some kind stiffness the interaction between the particle and its particle large similar the entropic elasticity rubber band see this leads confinement the quarks the interior mesons and nucleons with typical radii corresponding former bag models the hadrons the order magnitude the bag moreover the mentioned stiffness quantitatively related the called area behaviour the expectation value the wilson loop product the ordered coupling constants around closed loop proportional the area enclosed the for this behaviour the abelian behaviour the gauge group methods further analysis the content the theory various techniques have been developed work with some them are discussed briefly perturbative qcd perturbative qcd this approach based asymptotic which allows perturbation theory used accurately experiments performed very high although limited this approach has resulted the most precise tests qcd lattice qcd lattice qcd among perturbative approaches the most well established one lattice qcd this approach uses discrete set spacetime points called the reduce the analytically intractable path integrals the continuum theory very difficult numerical computation which then carried out supercomputers like the qcdoc which was constructed for precisely this while slow and intensive has wide giving insight into parts the theory inaccessible other particular into the explicit forces acting between quarks and antiquarks however the numerical sign problem makes difficult use lattice methods study qcd high density and low temperature nuclear matter the interior neutron expansion expansion known approximation the expansion starts from the premise that the number colors and makes series corrections account for the fact that until has been the source qualitative insight rather than method for quantitative modern variants include the ads cft approach effective theories for specific problems effective theories may written down which give qualitatively correct results certain the best these may then obtained systematic expansions some parameter the qcd one such effective field theory chiral perturbation theory which the qcd effective theory low more low energy expansion based the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking which exact symmetry when quark masses are equal but for the and which have small still good approximate depending the number quarks which are treated one uses either chipt chipt other effective theories are heavy quark effective theory which expands around heavy quark mass near and soft collinear effective theory which expands around large ratios energy addition effective models like the nambu lasinio model and the chiral model are often used when discussing general qcd sum rules qcd sum rules based operator product expansion one can derive sets relations that connect different observables with each nambu lasinio model one his recent kei ichi kondo derived energy limit theory linked the nambu lasinio model since basically particular local version the polyakov lasinio model the later being its local nothing but the nambu lasinio model which one has included the polyakov loop order describe certain the nambu lasinio model itself among many other used because relatively model chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon present certain conditions chiral limit massless qcd this however there the energy isolated quark the physical vacuum turns out well defined and experimental tests the notion quark flavors was prompted the necessity explaining the properties hadrons during the development the quark model the notion color was necessitated the puzzle the this has been dealt with the section the history qcd the first evidence for quarks real constituent elements hadrons was obtained deep inelastic scattering experiments slac the first evidence for gluons came three jet events petra several good quantitative tests perturbative qcd the running the qcd coupling deduced from many observations scaling violation polarized and unpolarized deep inelastic scattering vector boson production colliders this includes the drell yan process jet cross sections colliders event shape observables the lep quark production colliders quantitative tests perturbative qcd are because the predictions are harder the best probably the running the qcd coupling probed through lattice computations heavy quarkonium spectra there recent claim about the mass the heavy meson other perturbative tests are currently the level continuing work masses and form factors hadrons and their weak matrix elements are promising candidates for future quantitative the whole subject quark matter and the quark gluon plasma perturbative test bed for qcd which still remains properly one qualitative prediction qcd that there exist composite particles made solely gluons called glueballs that have not yet been definitively observed definitive observation glueball with the properties predicted qcd would strongly confirm the glueballs could definitively ruled this would serious experimental blow but scientists are unable confirm deny the existence glueballs despite the fact that particle accelerators have sufficient energy generate cross relations solid state physics there are unexpected relations solid state for the notion gauge invariance forms the basis the known mattis spin glasses which are systems with the usual spin degrees freedom for with the special fixed random couplings here the and quantities can independently and randomly take the values which corresponds simple gauge transformation this means that thermodynamic expectation values measurable the energy are however here the coupling degrees freedom which the qcd correspond the gluons are frozen fixed values the qcd they fluctuate and through the large number gauge degrees freedom the entropy plays important role see for positive the thermodynamics the mattis spin glass corresponds fact simply ferromagnet just because these systems have frustration this term basic measure spin glass quantitatively identical with the loop product along closed loop however for mattis spin glass contrast genuine spin glasses the quantity never becomes the basic notion frustration the glass actually similar the wilson loop quantity the the only difference again that the qcd one dealing with matrices and that one dealing with fluctuating quantity energetically perfect absence frustration should favorable and atypical for spin which means that one should add the loop product the some kind term representing punishment the qcd the wilson loop essential for the lagrangian the relation between the qcd and disordered magnetic the spin glasses belong were additionally stressed paper huberman und which also stresses the notion duality further analogy consists the already mentioned similarity polymer physics where analogously wilson loops called entangled appear which are important for the formation the entropy elasticity force proportional the rubber the abelian character the corresponds thereby the trivial chemical which glue different loop segments and asymptotic freedom means the polymer analogy simply
