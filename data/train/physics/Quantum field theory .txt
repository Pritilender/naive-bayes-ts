quantum mechanical models subatomic particles particle physics and quasiparticles condensed matter physics qft treats particles excited states underlying physical field these are called field quanta for quantum electrodynamics has one electron field and one photon field quantum chromodynamics has one field for each type quark and condensed there atomic displacement field that gives rise phonon particles edward witten describes qft the most difficult theory modern quantum mechanical interactions between particles are described interaction terms between the corresponding underlying qft interaction terms are similar spirit those between charges with electric and magnetic fields maxwell equations however unlike the classical fields fields qft generally exist quantum superpositions states and are subject the laws quantum quantum mechanical systems have fixed number with each particle having finite number degrees freedom the excited states qft can represent any number this makes quantum field theories especially useful for describing systems where the particle number may change over crucial feature relativistic because the fields are continuous quantities over there exist excited states with arbitrarily large numbers particles providing qft systems with effectively infinite number degrees infinite degrees freedom can easily lead divergences calculated quantities the quantities become techniques such renormalization qft parameters discretization spacetime lattice qcd are often used avoid such infinities yield physically meaningful most theories standard particle physics are formulated relativistic quantum field theories such qcd and the standard model qed the quantum theoretic description the electromagnetic approximately reproduces maxwell theory electrodynamics the energy with small linear corrections the maxwell equations required due virtual electron positron the perturbative approach quantum field the full field interaction terms are approximated perturbative expansion the number particles each term the expansion can thought forces between particles being mediated other the electromagnetic force between two electrons caused exchange photons similarly intermediate vector bosons mediate the weak force and gluons mediate the strong force the notion mediating particle comes from perturbation and does not make sense the context non perturbative approaches such with bound states the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field are the only two fundamental fields nature that have infinite range and corresponding classical energy which greatly diminishes and hides their excitations albert einstein attributed and discrete exchanges momenta and characteristic field the electromagnetic originally his principal motivation was explain the thermodynamics radiation although the photoelectric effect and compton scattering strongly suggest the existence the now understood that they can explained without invoking quantum electromagnetic therefore more definitive proof the quantum nature radiation now taken into modern quantum optics the antibunching effect there currently complete quantum theory the remaining fundamental force gravity many the proposed theories describe gravity qft postulate the existence graviton particle that mediates the gravitational presumably the yet unknown correct quantum theoretic

links history history quantum field theory foundations the early development the field involved dirac fock pauli heisenberg and bogolyubov this phase development culminated with the construction the theory quantum electrodynamics the gauge theory gauge theory was formulated and quantized leading the unification forces embodied the standard model particle physics this effort started the with the work yang and mills was carried martinus veltman and host others during the and completed the through the work gerard hooft frank wilczek david gross and david politzer grand synthesis parallel developments the understanding phase transitions condensed matter physics led the study the renormalization group this turn led the grand synthesis theoretical which unified theories particle and condensed matter physics through quantum field this involved the work michael fisher and leo kadanoff the which led the seminal reformulation quantum field theory kenneth wilson principles classical and quantum fields classical field theory classical field function defined over some region space and two physical phenomena which are described classical fields are newtonian gravitation described newtonian gravitational field and classical electromagnetism described the electric and magnetic fields and because such fields can principle take distinct values each point they are said have infinite degrees freedom classical field theory does however account for the mechanical aspects such physical for known from quantum mechanics that certain aspects electromagnetism involve discrete photons rather than continuous the business quantum field theory write down field that like classical function defined over space and but which also accommodates the observations quantum this quantum field not immediately clear how write down such quantum since quantum mechanics has structure very unlike field its most general quantum mechanics theory abstract operators acting abstract state space hilbert space where the observables represent physically observable quantities and the state space represents the possible states the system under for the fundamental observables associated with the motion single quantum mechanical particle are the position and momentum operators and field treats way index the field rather than there are two common ways developing quantum the path integral formalism and canonical quantization the latter these pursued this lagrangian formalism quantum field theory frequently makes use the lagrangian formalism from classical field theory this formalism analogous the lagrangian formalism used classical mechanics solve for the motion particle under the influence classical field one writes down lagrangian density involving and possibly its first derivatives and and then applies theoretic form the euler lagrange equation writing coordinates this form the lagrange equation where sum over performed according the rules einstein notation solving this one arrives the equations the for one begins with the lagrangian density and then applies the lagrange one obtains the equation motion this equation newton law universal gravitation expressed differential form terms the gravitational potential and the mass density despite the the field under study the gravitational rather than the gravitational similarly when classical field theory used study the field interest the electromagnetic four potential rather than the electric and magnetic fields and quantum field theory uses this same lagrangian procedure determine the equations motion for quantum these equations motion are then supplemented commutation relations derived from the canonical quantization procedure described thereby incorporating quantum mechanical effects into the behavior the single and particle quantum mechanics quantum mechanics first quantization quantum particle such electron described complex wavefunction whose evolution governed the schr dinger equation here the mass and the applied potential physical information about the behavior the particle extracted from the wavefunction constructing probability density functions for various for the for the position and the for the momentum integrating over yields the expectation for the and the momentum this treatment quantum where wavefunction evolves against classical background potential sometimes called first quantization this description quantum mechanics can extended describe the behavior multiple long the number and the type particles remain the particles are described wavefunction which governed extended version the dinger often one interested the case where particles are all the same type for the electrons orbiting neutral argon nucleus described the article identical particles this implies that the state the entire system must either symmetric bosons antisymmetric fermions when the coordinates its constituent particles are this achieved using slater determinant the wavefunction fermionic system and slater permanent for bosonic which equivalent element the symmetric antisymmetric subspace tensor for the general quantum state system bosons written where are the particle the number particles occupying state and the sum taken over all possible permutations acting elements this sum factorial distinct normalizing there are several shortcomings the above description quantum which are addressed quantum field first unclear how extend quantum mechanics include the effects special relativity attempted replacements for the dinger such the klein gordon equation the dirac equation have many unsatisfactory for they possess energy eigenvalues that extend that there seems easy definition ground state turns out that such inconsistencies arise from relativistic wavefunctions having probabilistic interpretation position probability conservation not relativistically covariant concept the second related the that quantum mechanics there mechanism describe particle creation and this crucial for describing phenomena such pair production which result from the conversion between mass and energy according the relativistic relation second quantization second quantization this will describe method for constructing quantum field theory called second quantization this basically involves choosing way index the quantum mechanical degrees freedom the space multiple particle based the hamiltonian formulation quantum several other approaches such the feynman path integral which uses lagrangian formulation for overview some these see the article quantization bosons for will first discuss second quantization for bosons which form perfectly symmetric quantum let denote the mutually orthogonal particle states which are possible the system and for the particle state with one particle state and two state the first step second quantization express such quantum states terms occupation numbers listing the number particles occupying each the particle states etc this simply another way labelling the for the above particle state denoted particle state belongs space states describing systems particles the next step combine the individual particle state spaces into extended state known fock space which can describe systems any number this composed the state space system with particles the called vacuum state written plus the state space particle plus the state space particle and states describing definite number particles are known fock states general element fock space will linear combination fock there one correspondence between the occupation number representation and valid boson states the fock this the quantum mechanical system has become quantum field the sense described the elementary degrees freedom are the occupation and each occupation number indexed number indicating which the particle states refers the properties this quantum field can explored defining creation and annihilation operators which add and subtract they are analogous ladder operators the quantum harmonic oscillator problem which added and subtracted energy however these operators literally create and annihilate particles given quantum the bosonic annihilation operator and creation operator are easily defined the occupation number representation having the following can shown that these are operators the usual quantum mechanical linear operators acting the fock furthermore they are indeed hermitian conjugates which justifies the way have written they can shown obey the commutation relation where stands for the kronecker delta these are precisely the relations obeyed the ladder operators for infinite set independent quantum harmonic oscillators one for each particle adding removing bosons from each state therefore analogous exciting exciting quantum energy harmonic applying annihilation operator followed its corresponding creation operator returns the number particles the single particle the combination operators known the number operator for the eigenstate the hamiltonian operator the quantum field through the schr dinger equation determines its can written terms creation and annihilation for for field free bosons the total energy the field found summing the energies the bosons each energy the single particle energy eigenstate has energy and there are bosons this then the total energy these bosons the energy the entire field then sum over this can turned into the hamiltonian operator the field replacing with the corresponding number this yields fermions turns out that different definition creation and annihilation must used for describing fermions according the pauli exclusion principle fermions cannot share quantum their occupation numbers can only take the value the fermionic annihilation operators and creation operators are defined their actions fock state thus these obey anticommutation relation one may notice from this that applying fermionic creation operator twice gives impossible for the particles share particle accordance with the exclusion field operators have previously mentioned that there can more than one way indexing the degrees freedom quantum second quantization indexes the field enumerating the particle quantum however have more natural think about field such the electromagnetic set degrees freedom indexed this can define field operators that create destroy particle particular point particle these operators turn out more convenient work because they make easier formulate theories that satisfy the demands single particle states are usually enumerated terms their momenta the particle box problem can construct field operators applying the fourier transform the creation and annihilation operators for these for the bosonic field annihilation operator the bosonic field operators obey the commutation relation where stands for the dirac delta function the fermionic relations are the with the commutators replaced the field operator not the same thing particle the former operator acting the fock and the latter mechanical amplitude for finding particle some however they are closely and are indeed commonly denoted with the same have hamiltonian with space say where the indices and run over all then the field theory hamiltonian the relativistic limit and for negligible this looks remarkably like expression for the expectation value the with playing the role the this relationship between the field operators and wavefunctions makes very easy formulate field theories starting from projected dynamics once the hamiltonian operator obtained part the canonical quantization process the time dependence the state described with the schr dinger equation just with other quantum alternatively the heisenberg picture can used where the time dependence the operators rather than the implications unification fields and particles this section requires expansion july the second procedure that have outlined the previous section takes set particle quantum states starting sometimes impossible define such particle and one must proceed directly quantum field for quantum theory the electromagnetic field must quantum field because impossible for various define wavefunction for single photon such the quantum field theory can constructed examining the mechanical properties the classical field and guessing the corresponding quantum for free quantum the quantum field theories obtained this way have the same properties those obtained using second such defined creation and annihilation operators obeying commutation anticommutation quantum field theory thus provides unified framework for describing objects such the electromagnetic whose excitations are and objects such which are treated excitations underlying electron long one can treat interactions perturbations free there are still unsolved problems relating the more general case interacting fields that may may not adequately described perturbation for more this see haag theorem physical meaning particle indistinguishability the second quantization procedure relies crucially the particles being identical would not have been able construct quantum field theory from distinguishable particle because there would have been way separating and indexing the degrees many physicists prefer take the converse which that quantum field theory explains what identical particles are ordinary quantum there not much theoretical motivation for using symmetric antisymmetric states and the need for such states simply regarded empirical from the point view quantum field particles are identical and only they are excitations the same underlying quantum thus the question why are all electrons arises from mistakenly regarding individual electrons fundamental when fact only the electron field that particle conservation and conservation during second started with hamiltonian and state space describing fixed number particles and ended with hamiltonian and state space for arbitrary number many common situations important and perfectly defined are describing gas atoms sealed box from the point view quantum field such situations are described quantum states that are eigenstates the number operator which measures the total number particles with any quantum mechanical conserved commutes with the that the quantum state trapped the particle subspace the total fock and the situation could equally well described ordinary particle quantum strictly this only true the noninteracting case the low energy density limit renormalized quantum field for can see that the boson hamiltonian described above conserves particle whenever the hamiltonian operates each particle destroyed annihilation operator immediately put back the creation operator the other and indeed encounter quantum states that are not eigenstates which not have defined particle such states are difficult impossible handle using ordinary quantum but they can easily described quantum field theory quantum superpositions states having different values for suppose have bosonic field whose particles can created destroyed interactions with fermionic the hamiltonian the combined system would given the hamiltonians the free boson and free fermion plus potential term such where and denotes the bosonic creation and annihilation and denotes the fermionic creation and annihilation and parameter that describes the strength the this interaction describes processes which fermion state either absorbs emits thereby being kicked into different eigenstate this type hamiltonian used describe interaction between conduction electrons and phonons metals the interaction between electrons and photons treated similar but little more complicated because the role spin must taken into one thing notice here that even start out with fixed number will typically end with superposition states with different numbers bosons later the number however conserved this condensed matter physics states with defined particle numbers are particularly important for describing the various superfluids many the defining characteristics superfluid arise from the notion that its quantum state superposition states with different particle the concept coherent state used model the laser and the bcs ground refers state with defined particle number but defined axiomatic approaches the preceding description quantum field theory follows the spirit which most physicists approach the however not mathematically rigorous over the past several there have been many attempts put quantum field theory firm mathematical footing formulating set axioms for these attempts fall into two broad the first class first proposed during the include the wightman osterwalder schrader and haag kastler systems they attempted formalize the notion valued within the context functional analysis and enjoyed limited was possible prove that any quantum field theory satisfying these axioms satisfied certain general such the spin statistics theorem and the cpt theorem unfortunately proved extraordinarily difficult show that any realistic field including the standard model satisfied these most the theories that could treated with these analytic axioms were physically being restricted dimensions and lacking interesting the construction theories satisfying one these sets axioms falls the field constructive quantum field theory important work was done this area the glimm jaffe and during the second set axioms based geometric ideas was this line which restricts its attention particular class quantum field theories known topological quantum field theories associated most closely with michael atiyah and graeme segal and was notably expanded upon edward witten richard borcherds and maxim kontsevich however most the physically relevant quantum field such the standard model are not topological quantum field the quantum field theory the fractional quantum hall effect notable the main impact axiomatic topological quantum field theory has been with important applications representation theory algebraic topology and differential geometry finding the proper axioms for quantum field theory still open and difficult problem one the millennium prize problems proving the existence mass gap mills theory linked this associated phenomena the previous part the described the most general properties quantum field some the quantum field theories studied various fields theoretical physics possess additional special such gauge and these are described the following renormalization renormalization early the history quantum field was found that many seemingly innocuous such the perturbative shift the energy electron due the presence the electromagnetic give infinite the reason that the perturbation theory for the shift energy involves sum over all other energy and there are infinitely many levels short distances that each give finite contribution which results divergent many these problems are related failures classical electrodynamics that were identified but unsolved the and they basically stem from the fact that many the supposedly intrinsic properties electron are tied the electromagnetic field that carries around with the energy carried single its self energy not simply the bare but also includes the energy contained its electromagnetic its attendant cloud the energy field spherical source diverges both classical and quantum but discovered weisskopf with help from furry quantum mechanics the divergence much going only the logarithm the radius the the solution the presciently suggested stueckelberg independently bethe after the crucial experiment lamb implemented one loop schwinger and systematically extended all loops feynman and dyson with converging work tomonaga isolated postwar comes from recognizing that all the infinities the interactions photons and electrons can isolated into redefining finite number quantities the equations replacing them with the observed specifically the mass and this called renormalization the technique renormalization recognizes that the problem essentially purely that extremely short distances are order define theory first place cutoff the postulating that quanta cannot have energies above some extremely high this has the effect replacing continuous space structure where very short wavelengths not lattices break rotational and one the crucial contributions made pauli and and modernized hooft and veltman preserving cutoff for perturbation theory this process called regularization there known symmetrical cutoff outside perturbation for rigorous numerical work people often use actual every quantity finite but depends the when taking the limit zero make sure that the physically observable quantities like the observed electron mass stay which means that the constants the lagrangian defining the theory depend the hopefully allowing the constants vary with the lattice all the results long distances become insensitive the defining continuum limit the renormalization procedure only works for certain class quantum field called renormalizable quantum field theories theory perturbatively renormalizable when the constants the lagrangian only diverge worst logarithms the lattice spacing for very short the continuum limit then well defined perturbation and even not fully well defined the problems only show distance scales that are exponentially small the inverse coupling for weak the standard model particle physics perturbatively and are its component theories quantum electrodynamics electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamics the three quantum electrodynamics believed not have continuum while the asymptotically free and weak hypercharge and strong color interactions are nonperturbatively well the renormalization group describes how renormalizable theories emerge the long distance energy effective field theory for any given energy because renormalizable theories are insensitive the precise nature the underlying energy distance this blessing because allows physicists formulate low energy theories without knowing the details high energy also because once renormalizable theory like the standard model found gives very few clues higher energy the only way high energy processes can seen the standard model when they allow otherwise forbidden they predict quantitative relations between the coupling haag theorem haag theorem from mathematically rigorous there exists interaction picture covariant quantum field this implies that the perturbative approach feynman diagrams qft not strictly despite producing vastly precise predictions validated this called haag theorem but most particle physicists relying qft largely shrug gauge freedom gauge theory theory that admits symmetry with local for every quantum theory the global phase the wave function arbitrary and does not represent something consequently the theory invariant under global change phases adding constant the phase all wave everywhere this global symmetry quantum electrodynamics the theory also invariant under local change that one may shift the phase all wave functions that the shift may different every point this local symmetry however order for defined derivative operator one must introduce new field the gauge field which also transforms order for the local change variables the phase our not affect the quantum electrodynamics this gauge field the electromagnetic field the change local gauge variables termed gauge transformation quantum field theory the excitations fields represent particles the particle associated with excitations the gauge field the gauge boson which the photon the case quantum the degrees freedom quantum field theory are local fluctuations the the existence gauge symmetry reduces the number degrees simply because some fluctuations the fields can transformed zero gauge they are equivalent having fluctuations and they therefore have physical such fluctuations are usually called physical degrees gauge artifacts usually some them have negative norm making them inadequate for consistent therefore classical field theory has gauge then its quantized version the corresponding quantum field will have this symmetry other gauge symmetry cannot have quantum anomaly gauge symmetry anomalous not kept the quantum then the theory for quantum had there been gauge anomaly this would require the appearance photons with longitudinal polarization and polarization the time the latter having negative norm rendering the theory another possibility would for these photons appear only intermediate processes but not the final products any making the theory unitary and again inconsistent see optical theorem the gauge transformations theory consist several different which may not commutative these transformations are together described mathematical object known gauge group infinitesimal gauge transformations are the gauge group generators therefore the number gauge bosons the group dimension number generators forming basis all the fundamental interactions nature are described gauge these quantum chromodynamics whose gauge group the gauge bosons are eight gluons the electroweak theory whose gauge group direct product and gravity whose classical theory general relativity admits the equivalence principle which form gauge however explicitly multivalued gauge transformations the gauge transformations which leave the theory invariant only valued gauge functions which satisfy the schwarz integrability criterion interesting extension gauge transformations arises the gauge functions are allowed multivalued functions which violate the integrability these are capable changing the physical field strengths and are therefore proper symmetry nevertheless the transformed field equations describe correctly the physical laws the presence the newly generated field see the textbook kleinert cited below for the applications phenomena supersymmetry supersymmetry supersymmetry assumes that every fundamental fermion has superpartner that boson and vice was introduced order solve the called hierarchy problem that explain why particles not protected any symmetry like the higgs boson not receive radiative corrections its mass driving the larger scales planck was soon realized that supersymmetry has other interesting its gauged version extension general relativity supergravity and key ingredient for the consistency string theory the way supersymmetry protects the hierarchies the since for every particle there superpartner with the same any loop radiative correction cancelled the loop corresponding its rendering the theory since superpartners have yet been supersymmetry exists must broken through called soft which breaks supersymmetry without ruining its helpful the simplest models this breaking require that the energy the superpartners not too these supersymmetry expected
