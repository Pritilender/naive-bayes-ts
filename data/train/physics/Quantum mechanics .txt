mathematical description much the dual particle like and wave like behavior and interactions energy and matter quantum mechanics provides substantially useful framework for many features the modern periodic table elements including the behavior atoms during chemical bonding and has played significant role the development many modern advanced topics quantum some these behaviors are macroscopic

mathematical formulations quantum mechanics are mathematical the wavefunction provides information about the probability amplitude momentum and other physical properties mathematical manipulations the wavefunction usually involve bra ket notation which requires understanding complex numbers and linear functionals the wavefunction formulation treats the particle quantum harmonic oscillator and the mathematics akin that describing acoustic resonance many the results quantum mechanics are not easily visualized terms classical mechanics for quantum mechanical model the lowest energy state the ground state zero opposed more traditional ground state with zero kinetic energy all particles instead traditional unchanging zero energy quantum mechanics allows for far more chaotic according john wheeler the earliest versions quantum mechanics were formulated the first decade the about this the atomic theory and the corpuscular theory light updated einstein first came widely accepted scientific these latter theories can viewed quantum theories matter and electromagnetic radiation respectively early quantum theory was significantly reformulated the werner heisenberg max born and pascual jordan matrix mechanics louis broglie and erwin dinger wave mechanics and wolfgang pauli and satyendra nath bose statistics subatomic moreover the copenhagen interpretation niels bohr became

light began the and centuries when scientists such robert hooke christiaan huygens and leonhard euler proposed wave theory light based experimental thomas young english polymath performed the famous double slit experiment that later described paper entitled the nature light and this experiment played major role the general acceptance the wave theory light with the discovery cathode rays michael faraday these studies were followed the statement the black body radiation problem gustav kirchhoff the suggestion ludwig boltzmann that the energy states physical system can and the quantum hypothesis max planck planck hypothesis that energy radiated and absorbed discrete quanta energy precisely matched the observed patterns body wilhelm wien empirically determined distribution law body known wien law his ludwig boltzmann independently arrived this result considerations maxwell equations however was valid only high and underestimated the radiance low later max planck corrected this model using boltzmann statistical interpretation thermodynamics and proposed what now called planck law which led the development quantum among the first study quantum phenomena nature were arthur compton raman pieter zeeman each whom has quantum effect named after robert millikan studied the photoelectric effect experimentally and albert einstein developed theory for the same time niels bohr developed his theory the atomic structure which was later confirmed the experiments henry moseley peter debye extended niels theory atomic introducing elliptical orbits concept also introduced arnold sommerfeld this phase known old quantum theory according each energy proportional its frequency max planck where planck constant planck insisted that this was simply aspect the processes absorption and emission radiation and had nothing with the physical reality the radiation considered his quantum hypothesis mathematical trick get the right answer rather than sizable citation needed however albert einstein interpreted quantum hypothesis realistically and used explain the photoelectric effect which shining light certain materials can eject electrons from the solvay conference brussels the foundations quantum mechanics were established during the first half the century max planck niels bohr werner heisenberg louis broglie arthur compton albert einstein erwin dinger max born john von neumann paul dirac enrico fermi wolfgang pauli max von laue freeman dyson david hilbert wilhelm wien satyendra nath bose arnold sommerfeld and others the developments quantum mechanics led its becoming the standard formulation for atomic the summer bohr and heisenberg published results that closed the old quantum out deference their like behavior certain processes and light quanta came called photons from simple postulation was born flurry theorizing and thus the entire field quantum physics emerged leading its wider acceptance the fifth solvay conference the other exemplar that led quantum mechanics was the study electromagnetic waves such visible and ultraviolet when was found max planck that the energy waves could described consisting small packets quanta albert einstein further developed this idea show that electromagnetic wave such light could also described particle later called the photon with discrete quantum energy that was dependent its einstein was able use the photon theory light explain the photoelectric effect for which won the nobel prize this led theory unity between subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves which particles and waves are neither simply particle nor wave but have certain properties this originated the concept wave particle duality while quantum mechanics traditionally described the world the very also needed explain certain recently investigated macroscopic systems such superconductors superfluids and large organic the word quantum derives from the latin meaning how how quantum refers discrete unit that quantum theory assigns certain physical quantities such the energy atom rest see figure the discovery that particles are discrete packets energy with like properties led the branch physics dealing with atomic and atomic systems which today called quantum underlies the mathematical framework many fields physics and chemistry including condensed matter physics solid state physics atomic physics molecular physics computational physics computational chemistry quantum chemistry particle physics nuclear chemistry and nuclear physics some fundamental aspects the theory are still actively quantum mechanics essential understanding the behavior systems atomic length scales and the physical nature atom was solely described classical mechanics electrons would not orbit the nucleus since orbiting electrons emit radiation due circular motion and would eventually collide with the nucleus due this loss this framework was unable explain the stability instead electrons remain non smeared probabilistic wave particle orbital about the defying the traditional assumptions classical mechanics and electromagnetism quantum mechanics was initially developed provide better explanation and description the especially the differences the spectra light emitted different isotopes the same element well subatomic the mechanical atomic model has succeeded spectacularly the realm where classical mechanics and electromagnetism broadly quantum mechanics incorporates four classes phenomena for which classical physics cannot quantization certain physical properties particle duality principle uncertainty quantum entanglement mathematical formulations mathematical formulations quantum mechanics quantum logic the mathematically rigorous formulation quantum mechanics developed paul dirac david hilbert john von neumann and hermann weyl the possible states quantum mechanical system are represented unit vectors called state formally these reside complex separable hilbert space variously called the state space the associated hilbert the that well defined complex number norm the phase other the possible states are points the projective space hilbert usually called the complex projective space the exact nature this hilbert space dependent the for the state space for position and momentum states the space square integrable functions while the state space for the spin single proton just the product two complex each observable represented maximally hermitian self adjoint linear operator acting the state each eigenstate observable corresponds eigenvector the and the associated eigenvalue corresponds the value the observable that the spectrum the observable can attain only those discrete the formalism quantum the state system given time described complex wave function also referred state vector complex vector space this abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation probabilities outcomes concrete for allows one compute the probability finding electron particular region around the nucleus particular contrary classical one can never make simultaneous predictions conjugate variables such position and with for electrons may considered certain located somewhere within given region but with their exact positions contours constant often referred clouds may drawn around the nucleus atom conceptualize where the electron might located with the most heisenberg uncertainty principle quantifies the inability precisely locate the particle given its conjugate according one the result measurement the wave function containing the probability information for system collapses from given initial state particular the possible results measurement are the eigenvalues the operator representing the which explains the choice hermitian operators for which all the eigenvalues are the probability distribution observable given state can found computing the spectral decomposition the corresponding heisenberg uncertainty principle represented the statement that the operators corresponding certain observables not commute the probabilistic nature quantum mechanics thus stems from the act this one the most difficult aspects quantum systems was the central topic the famous bohr einstein debates which the two scientists attempted clarify these fundamental principles way thought experiments the decades after the formulation quantum the question what constitutes measurement has been extensively newer interpretations quantum mechanics have been formulated that away with the concept wavefunction for the relative state interpretation the basic idea that when quantum system interacts with measuring their respective wavefunctions become entangled that the original quantum system ceases exist independent for see the article measurement quantum mechanics generally quantum mechanics does not assign definite instead makes prediction using probability distribution that describes the probability obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring often these results are skewed many such dense probability probability clouds are but better than the bohr model whereby electron location given probability function the wave function eigenvalue such that the probability the squared modulus the complex quantum state nuclear naturally these probabilities will depend the quantum state the instant the hence uncertainty involved the there however certain states that are associated with definite value particular these are known eigenstates the observable eigen can translated from german meaning inherent characteristic the everyday natural and intuitive think everything every being everything appears have definite definite definite and definite time however quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values position and momentum since they are conjugate pairs its energy and time since they too are conjugate rather provides only range probabilities which that particle might given its momentum and momentum therefore helpful use different words describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values usually system will not eigenstate the observable are interested however one measures the the wavefunction will instantaneously eigenstate generalized eigenstate that this process known wavefunction collapse controversial and debated process that involves expanding the system under study include the measurement one knows the corresponding wave function the instant before the one will able compute the probability the wavefunction collapsing into each the possible for the free particle the previous example will usually have wavefunction that wave packet centered around some mean position neither eigenstate position nor when one measures the position the impossible predict with certainty the but not that will near where the amplitude the wave function after the measurement having obtained some result the wave function collapses into position eigenstate centered the time evolution quantum state described the schr dinger equation which the hamiltonian the operator corresponding the total energy the generates the time the time evolution wave functions deterministic the sense that given wavefunction initial time makes definite prediction what the wavefunction will any later time during measurement the other the change the initial wavefunction into later wavefunction not unpredictable random evolution simulation can seen wave functions change time the schr dinger equation describes how wavefunctions change playing role similar newton second law classical mechanics the dinger applied the aforementioned example the free predicts that the center wave packet will move through space constant velocity like classical particle with forces acting however the wave packet will also spread out time which means that the position becomes more uncertain with this also has the effect turning position eigenstate which can thought infinitely sharp wave into broadened wave packet that longer represents certain position probability densities figures acoustic classical physics energy frequency angular momentum quantized only resonant frequencies some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent such when stationary state constant time vanishes the absolute square the wave many systems that are treated dynamically classical mechanics are described such static wave for single electron unexcited atom pictured classically particle moving circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus whereas quantum mechanics described spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus fig however that only the lowest angular momentum labeled are spherically the dinger equation acts the entire probability not merely its absolute whereas the absolute value the probability amplitude encodes information about its phase encodes information about the interference between quantum this gives rise the behavior quantum turns analytic solutions the dinger equation are available for only very small number relatively simple model hamiltonians which the quantum harmonic oscillator the particle box the hydrogen molecular ion and the hydrogen atom are the most important even the helium atom which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen has defied all attempts fully analytic there exist several techniques for generating approximate however the important method known perturbation theory one uses the analytic result for simple quantum mechanical model generate result for more complicated model that related the simpler model for one the addition weak potential energy another method the classical equation approach which applies systems for which quantum mechanics produces only weak deviations from classical these deviations can then computed based the classical this approach particularly important the field quantum chaos mathematically equivalent formulations quantum mechanics there are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations quantum one the oldest and most commonly used formulations the transformation theory proposed paul dirac which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations quantum mechanics matrix mechanics invented werner heisenberg and wave mechanics invented erwin dinger especially since werner heisenberg was awarded the nobel prize physics for the creation quantum the role max born the development was overlooked until the nobel the role noted biography which recounts his role the matrix formulation quantum and the use probability heisenberg himself acknowledges having learned matrices from published festschrift honoring max planck the matrix the instantaneous state quantum system encodes the probabilities its measurable observables examples observables include energy position momentum and angular momentum observables can either continuous the position discrete the energy electron bound hydrogen alternative formulation quantum mechanics feynman path integral formulation which mechanical amplitude considered sum over all possible classical and classical paths between the initial and final this the mechanical counterpart the action principle classical interactions with other scientific theories the rules quantum mechanics are they assert that the state space system hilbert space and that observables that system are hermitian operators acting that although they not tell which hilbert space which these can chosen appropriately order obtain quantitative description quantum important guide for making these choices the correspondence principle which states that the predictions quantum mechanics reduce those classical mechanics when system moves higher energies larger quantum whereas single particle exhibits degree systems incorporating millions particles averaging takes over the high energy the statistical probability random behaviour approaches other classical mechanics simply quantum mechanics large this high limit known the classical correspondence limit one can even start from established classical model particular then attempt guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise the classical model the correspondence list unsolved problems physics the correspondence limit quantum mechanics there preferred interpretation quantum how does the quantum description which includes elements such the superposition and wavefunction collapse give rise the reality when quantum mechanics was originally was applied models whose correspondence limit was non relativistic classical mechanics for the known model the quantum harmonic oscillator uses explicitly relativistic expression for the kinetic energy the and thus quantum version the classical harmonic oscillator early attempts merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement the dinger equation with covariant equation such the klein gordon equation the dirac equation while these theories were successful explaining many experimental they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect the relativistic creation and annihilation fully relativistic quantum theory required the development quantum field theory which applies quantization field rather than fixed set the first complete quantum field quantum electrodynamics provides fully quantum description the electromagnetic interaction the full apparatus quantum field theory often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic simpler one that has been employed since the inception quantum treat charged particles quantum mechanical objects being acted classical electromagnetic field for the elementary quantum model the hydrogen atom describes the electric field the hydrogen atom using classical coulomb potential this approach fails quantum fluctuations the electromagnetic field play important such the emission photons charged particles quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been the quantum field theory the strong nuclear force called quantum chromodynamics and describes the interactions subnuclear particles such quarks and gluons the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were their quantized into single quantum field theory known electroweak theory the physicists abdus salam sheldon glashow and steven weinberg these three men shared the nobel prize physics for this has proven difficult construct quantum models gravity the remaining fundamental force semi classical approximations are and have led predictions such hawking radiation however the formulation complete theory quantum gravity hindered apparent incompatibilities between general relativity the most accurate theory gravity currently and some the fundamental assumptions quantum the resolution these incompatibilities area active and theories such string theory are among the possible candidates for future theory quantum classical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain with complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar quantum quantum mechanics and classical physics predictions quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally extremely high degree according the correspondence principle between classical and quantum all objects obey the laws quantum and classical mechanics just approximation for large systems objects statistical quantum mechanics large collection the laws classical mechanics thus follow from the laws quantum mechanics statistical average the limit large systems large quantum numbers however chaotic systems not have good quantum and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions these quantum coherence essential difference between classical and quantum theories illustrated the einstein rosen paradox attempt disprove quantum mechanics appeal local realism quantum interference involves adding together probability amplitudes whereas classical waves infer that there adding together intensities for microscopic the extension the system much smaller than the coherence length which gives rise range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic quantum quantum coherence not typically evident macroscopic though exception this rule may occur extremely low temperatures approaching absolute zero which quantum behavior may manifest itself this accordance with the following many macroscopic properties classical system are direct consequence the quantum behavior its for the stability bulk matter consisting atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces the rigidity and the thermal chemical optical and magnetic properties matter are all results the interaction electric charges under the rules quantum while the seemingly exotic behavior matter posited quantum mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with particles extremely small size velocities approaching the speed light the laws often considered newtonian physics remain accurate predicting the behavior the vast majority large objects the order the size large molecules velocities much smaller than the velocity light relativity and quantum mechanics relativistic quantum mechanics even with the defining postulates both theory general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported rigorous and repeated empirical evidence and while they not directly contradict each other theoretically least with regard their primary they have proven extremely difficult incorporate into one cohesive einstein himself well known for rejecting some the claims quantum while clearly contributing the did not accept many the more philosophical consequences and quantum such the lack deterministic causality famously quoted response this god does not play with also had difficulty with the assertion that single subatomic particle can occupy numerous areas space one however was also the first notice some the apparently exotic consequences entanglement and used them formulate the einstein rosen paradox the hope showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable implications taken complete description physical this was but was shown john bell see bell inequality that although einstein was correct identifying seemingly paradoxical implications quantum mechanical nonlocality these implications could experimentally alain initial experiments and many subsequent experiments have definitively verified quantum according the paper bell and the copenhagen interpretation the common interpretation quantum mechanics physicists since and contrary quantum mechanics was not the same time realistic theory and local theory the einstein rosen paradox shows any case that there exist experiments which one can measure the state one particle and instantaneously change the state its entangled partner although the two particles can arbitrary distance however this effect does not violate causality since transfer information quantum entanglement forms the basis quantum cryptography which used security commercial applications banking and gravity negligible many areas particle that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics not urgent issue those particular however the lack correct theory quantum gravity important issue cosmology and the search physicists for elegant theory everything consequently resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been major goal and century many prominent including stephen hawking have labored for many years the attempt discover theory underlying everything this toe would combine not only the different models subatomic but also derive the four fundamental forces nature the strong force electromagnetism the weak force and gravity from single force while stephen hawking was initially believer the theory after considering incompleteness theorem has concluded that one not and has stated publicly his lecture del and the end attempts unified field theory grand unified theory the quest unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics still quantum electrodynamics quantum which currently the perturbative regime the most accurately tested physical unreliable source has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak force and work currently being done merge the electroweak and strong force into the electrostrong force current predictions state that around gev the three aforementioned forces are fused into single unified beyond this grand speculated that may possible merge gravity with the other three gauge expected occur roughly gev however and while special relativity parsimoniously incorporated into quantum the expanded general relativity currently the best theory describing the gravitation has not been fully incorporated into quantum one those searching for coherent toe edward witten theoretical physicist who formulated the theory which attempt describing the supersymmetrical based string theory theory posits that our apparent dimensional spacetime actually dimensional spacetime containing spatial dimensions and time although the spatial dimensions are lower energies completely compactified infinitely and not readily amenable measurement another popular theory loop quantum gravity theory that describes the quantum properties also theory quantum space and quantum time because general relativity the geometry spacetime manifestation gravity lqg attempt merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity the main output the theory physical picture space where space the granularity direct consequence the has the same nature the granularity the photons the quantum theory electromagnetism the discrete levels

the predicted size this structure the planck length which approximately according there meaning length shorter than this planck scale energy therefore lqg predicts that not just but also space has atomic loop quantum gravity was first proposed carlo rovelli philosophical implications interpretations quantum mechanics since its the many counter intuitive aspects and results quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations even fundamental such max born basic rules concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions took decades appreciated society and many leading richard feynman once think can safely say that nobody understands quantum according steven weinberg there now opinion entirely satisfactory interpretation quantum the copenhagen interpretation due largely the danish theoretical physicist niels bohr remains the quantum mechanical formalism that currently most widely accepted amongst some years after its according this the probabilistic nature quantum mechanics not temporary feature which will eventually replaced deterministic but instead must considered final renunciation the classical idea causality also believed therein that any defined application the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference the experimental due the complementarity nature evidence obtained under different experimental albert einstein himself one the founders quantum disliked this loss determinism measurement einstein held that there should local hidden variable theory underlying quantum mechanics consequently that the present theory was produced series objections the the most famous which has become known the einstein rosen paradox john bell showed that this epr paradox led experimentally testable differences between quantum mechanics and local realistic experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy quantum thereby demonstrating that the physical world cannot described any local realistic the bohr einstein debates provide vibrant critique the copenhagen interpretation from epistemological point the everett worlds interpretation formulated holds that all the possibilities described quantum theory simultaneously occur multiverse composed mostly independent parallel this not accomplished introducing some new quantum but the removing the axiom the collapse the wave all the possible consistent states the measured system and the measuring apparatus including the are present real physical not just formally other interpretations quantum superposition such superposition consistent state combinations different systems called entangled state while the multiverse perceive deterministic behavior governed because can observe only the universe the consistent state contribution the aforementioned that inhabit everett interpretation perfectly consistent with john bell experiments and makes them intuitively however according the theory quantum decoherence these parallel will never accessible the inaccessibility can understood once measurement the measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured and huge number other some which are photons flying away the speed light towards the other end the order prove that the wave function did not one would have bring all these particles back and measure them together with the system that was originally not only this completely but even one could theoretically would have destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place include the light these bell tests cramer formulated his transactional interpretation relational quantum mechanics appeared the late the modern derivative the copenhagen interpretation applications quantum mechanics had enormous success explaining many the features our quantum mechanics often the only tool available that can reveal the individual behaviors the subatomic particles that make all forms matter electrons protons neutrons photons and quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string theories candidates for theory everything see reductionism quantum mechanics also critically important for understanding how individual atoms combine covalently form
