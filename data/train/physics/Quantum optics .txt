article introducing more precise april quantum optics field research that uses semi classical and quantum mechanical physics investigate phenomena involving light and its interactions with matter submicroscopic contents history quantum optics concepts quantum optics quantum electronics see also notes references further reading external links history quantum optics light propagating vacuum has its energy and momentum quantized according integer number particles known photons quantum optics studies the nature and effects light quantized the first major development leading that understanding was the correct modeling the blackbody radiation spectrum max planck under the hypothesis light being emitted discrete units the photoelectric effect was further evidence this quantization explained einstein paper discovery for which was awarded the nobel prize niels bohr showed that the hypothesis optical radiation being quantized corresponded his theory the quantized energy levels and the spectrum discharge emission from hydrogen the understanding the interaction between light and matter following these developments was crucial for the development quantum mechanics however the subfields quantum mechanics dealing with light interaction were principally regarded research into matter rather than into hence one rather spoke atom physics and quantum electronics laser science research into design and application these became important and the quantum mechanics underlying the principles was studied now with more emphasis the properties light dubious discuss and the name quantum optics became laser science needed good theoretical and also because research into these soon proved very interest quantum optics following the work dirac quantum field theory george sudarshan roy glauber and leonard mandel applied quantum theory the electromagnetic field the and gain more detailed understanding photodetection and the statistics light see degree coherence this led the introduction the coherent state concept which addressed variations between laser thermal exotic squeezed states etc became understood that light cannot fully described just referring the electromagnetic fields describing the waves the classical kimble demonstrated single atom emitting one photon further compelling evidence that light consists previously unknown quantum states light with characteristics unlike classical such squeezed light were subsequently development short and ultrashort laser created switching and modelocking techniques opened the way the study what became known ultrafast applications for solid state research raman spectroscopy were and mechanical forces light matter were the latter led levitating and positioning clouds atoms even small biological samples optical trap optical tweezers laser this along with doppler cooling was the crucial technology needed achieve the celebrated bose einstein condensation other remarkable results are the demonstration quantum entanglement quantum teleportation quantum logic gates the latter are much interest quantum information theory subject which partly emerged from quantum partly from theoretical computer science today fields interest among quantum optics researchers include parametric conversion parametric oscillation even shorter light use quantum optics for quantum information manipulation single bose einstein condensates their and how manipulate them field often called atom optics coherent perfect absorbers and much topics classified under the term quantum especially applied engineering and technological often under the modern term photonics several nobel prizes have been awarded for work quantum these were serge haroche and david wineland for breaking experimental methods that enable measuring manipulation individual quantum theodor nsch roy glauber and john hall concepts quantum optics according quantum light may considered not only electro magnetic wave but also stream particles called photons which travel with the vacuum speed light these particles should not considered classical billiard but quantum mechanical particles described wavefunction spread over finite each particle carries one quantum equal where planck constant and the frequency the that energy possessed single photon corresponds exactly the transition between discrete energy levels atom other that emitted the material absorption photon the reverse einstein explanation spontaneous emission also predicted the existence stimulated emission the principle upon which the laser rests however the actual invention the maser and many years later was dependent method produce population inversion the use statistical mechanics fundamental the concepts quantum light described terms field operators for creation and annihilation the language quantum electrodynamics frequently encountered state the light field the coherent state introduced roy glauber this which can used approximately describe the output frequency laser well above the laser exhibits poissonian photon number via certain nonlinear coherent state can transformed into squeezed coherent state applying squeezing operator which can exhibit super sub poissonian photon such light called squeezed light other important quantum aspects are related correlations photon statistics between different for spontaneous parametric conversion can generate called twin where each photon one beam associated with photon the other atoms are considered quantum mechanical oscillators with discrete energy spectrum with the transitions between the energy eigenstates being driven the absorption emission light according for solid state one uses the energy band models solid state physics this important for understanding how light detected state commonly used quantum electronics quantum electronics term that was used mainly between the and denote the area physics dealing with the effects quantum mechanics the behavior electrons together with their interactions with photons today rarely considered field its own and has been absorbed other solid state physics regularly takes quantum mechanics into and usually concerned with specific applications quantum mechanics electronics researched within semiconductor physics the term also encompassed the basic processes laser operation which today studied topic quantum usage the term overlapped early work the quantum hall effect and quantum cellular automata see also physics portal optics optical phase space optical physics nonclassical light valleytronics
