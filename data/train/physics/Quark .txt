called hadrons the most stable which are protons and neutrons the components atomic nuclei due phenomenon known color confinement quarks are never directly observed found they can found only within hadrons such baryons which protons and neutrons are and mesons for this much what known about quarks has been drawn from observations the hadrons there are six types known flavors down strange charm bottom and top and down quarks have the lowest masses all the heavier quarks rapidly change into and down quarks through process particle decay the transformation from higher mass state lower mass because and down quarks are generally stable and the most common the universe whereas charm top and bottom quarks can only produced high energy collisions such those involving cosmic rays and particle

with antimatter antiquarks have the same mean lifetime and spin their respective but the electric charge and other charges have the opposite quarks are spin particles implying that they are fermions according the spin statistics theorem they are subject the pauli exclusion principle which states that two identical fermions can simultaneously occupy the same quantum state this contrast bosons particles with integer any number which can the same unlike leptons quarks possess color charge which causes them engage the strong interaction the resulting attraction between different quarks causes the formation composite particles known hadrons see strong interaction and color charge below the quarks which determine the quantum numbers hadrons are called valence quarks apart from any hadron may contain indefinite number virtual sea quarks antiquarks and gluons which not influence its quantum there are two families baryons with three valence and mesons with valence quark and the most common baryons are the proton and the the building blocks the atomic nucleus great number hadrons are known see list baryons and list mesons most them differentiated their quark content and the properties these constituent quarks the existence exotic hadrons with more valence such tetraquarks and pentaquarks has been conjectured but not elementary fermions are grouped into three generations each comprising two leptons and two the first generation includes and down the second strange and charm and the third bottom and top all searches for fourth generation quarks and other elementary fermions have and there strong indirect evidence that more than three generations particles higher generations generally have greater mass and less causing them decay into generation particles means weak interactions only generation and quarks occur commonly heavier quarks can only created energy collisions such those involving cosmic rays and decay however they are thought have been present during the first fractions second after the big bang when the universe was extremely hot and dense phase the quark epoch studies heavier quarks are conducted artificially created such particle accelerators having electric mass color and quarks are the only known elementary particles that engage all four fundamental interactions contemporary electromagnetism gravitation strong and weak gravitation too weak relevant individual particle interactions except extremes energy planck energy and distance scales planck distance however since successful quantum theory gravity exists gravitation not described the standard see the table properties below for more complete overview the six quark properties history murray mann ted george zweig the quark model was independently proposed physicists murray mann and george zweig the proposal came the heels formulation particle classification system known the eightfold way more technical flavor symmetry physicist yuval eman had independently developed scheme similar the eightfold way the same also the time the quark the particle zoo included amongst other multitude hadrons gell mann and zweig posited that they were not elementary but were instead composed combinations quarks and their model involved three flavors down and strange which they ascribed properties such spin and electric the initial reaction the physics community the proposal was there was particular contention about whether the quark was physical entity mere abstraction used explain concepts that were not fully understood the less than extensions the zweig model were sheldon lee glashow and james bjorken predicted the existence fourth flavor which they called charm the addition was proposed because allowed for better description the weak interaction the mechanism that allows quarks equalized the number known quarks with the number known leptons and implied mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses the known mesons deep inelastic scattering experiments the stanford linear accelerator center showed that the proton contained much point like objects and was therefore not elementary physicists were reluctant firmly identify these objects with quarks the instead calling them partons term coined richard feynman the objects that were observed slac would later identified and down quarks the other flavors were nevertheless parton remains use collective term for the constituents hadrons antiquarks and gluons the strange existence was indirectly validated scattering not only was necessary component mann and quark but provided explanation for the kaon and pion hadrons discovered cosmic rays paper glashow john iliopoulos and luciano maiani presented further reasoning for the existence the yet undiscovered charm quark the number supposed quark flavors grew the current six when makoto kobayashi and toshihide maskawa noted that the experimental observation violation could explained there were another pair baryon brookhaven national laboratory charm quarks were produced almost simultaneously two teams november see november revolution one slac under burton richter and one brookhaven national laboratory under samuel ting the charm quarks were observed bound with charm antiquarks the two parties had assigned the discovered meson two different and thus became formally known the meson the discovery finally convinced the physics community the quark the following years number suggestions appeared for extending the quark model six the paper haim harari was the first coin the terms top and bottom for the additional the bottom quark was observed team fermilab led leon lederman this was strong indicator the top without the top the bottom quark would have been without however was not until that the top quark was finally also the cdf and teams had mass much larger than had been previously almost large that gold atom etymology for some gell mann was undecided actual spelling for the term intended until found the word quark james joyce book finnegans wake three quarks for muster sure has not got much bark and sure any has all beside the finnegans wake gell mann went into further detail regarding the name the quark his book the quark and the jaguar when assigned the name quark the fundamental constituents the had the sound without the which could have been kwork then one occasional perusals finnegans wake james came across the word quark the phrase three quarks for muster since quark for one the cry the was clearly intended rhyme with mark well bark and other such had find excuse pronounce kwork but the book represents the dream publican named humphrey chimpden words the text are typically drawn from several sources like the portmanteau words through the from time phrases occur the book that are partially determined calls for drinks the therefore that perhaps one the multiple sources the cry three quarks for muster might three quarts for mister which case the pronunciation kwork would not totally any the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur zweig preferred the name ace for the particle had but terminology came prominence once the quark model had been commonly the quark flavors were given their names for number the and down quarks are named after the and down components isospin which they strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered components the strange particles discovered cosmic rays years before the quark model was these particles were deemed strange because they had unusually long glashow who coproposed charm quark with quoted called our construct the charmed for were fascinated and pleased the symmetry brought the subnuclear the names bottom and top coined were chosen because they are logical partners for and down the bottom and top quarks were sometimes referred beauty and truth respectively but these names have somewhat fallen out while truth never did catch accelerator complexes devoted massive production bottom quarks are sometimes called beauty factories properties electric charge electric charge quarks have fractional electric charge values either times the elementary charge depending charm and top quarks collectively referred type quarks have charge while strange and bottom quarks down type quarks have antiquarks have the opposite charge their corresponding type antiquarks have charges and type antiquarks have charges since the electric charge hadron the sum the charges the constituent all hadrons have integer the combination three quarks three antiquarks quark and antiquark always results integer for the hadron constituents atomic neutrons and have charges and respectively the neutron composed two down quarks and one and the proton two quarks and one down spin spin spin intrinsic property elementary and its direction important degree freedom sometimes visualized the rotation object around its own axis hence the name spin though this notion somewhat misguided subatomic scales because elementary particles are believed point like spin can represented vector whose length measured units the reduced planck constant pronounced for measurement the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values for this reason quarks are classified spin particles the component spin along given axis convention the axis often denoted arrow for the value and down arrow for the value placed after the symbol for for quark with spin along the axis denoted weak interaction weak interaction feynman diagram beta decay quark one flavor can transform into quark another flavor only through the weak one the four fundamental interactions particle absorbing emitting boson any type quark charm and top can change into any type quark strange and bottom and vice this flavor transformation mechanism causes the radioactive process beta decay which neutron splits into proton electron and electron antineutrino see this occurs when one the down quarks the neutron decays into quark emitting virtual boson transforming the neutron into proton the boson then decays into electron and electron both beta decay and the inverse process inverse beta decay are routinely used medical applications such positron emission tomography and experiments involving neutrino detection strengths ckm matrix while the process flavor transformation the same for all each quark has preference transform into the quark its own the relative tendencies all flavor transformations are described mathematical table called the cabibbo maskawa matrix ckm enforcing unitarity the approximate magnitudes the entries the ckm matrix where represents the tendency quark flavor change into quark flavor vice there exists equivalent weak interaction matrix for leptons right side the boson the above beta decay called the pontecorvo sakata matrix pmns together the ckm and pmns matrices describe all flavor but the links between the two are not yet strong interaction and color charge color charge strong interaction according qcd quarks possess property called color charge there are three types color arbitrarily labeled blue green and red each them complemented anticolor antiblue antigreen and antired every quark carries while every antiquark carries the system attraction and repulsion between quarks charged with different combinations the three colors called strong interaction which mediated force carrying particles known gluons this discussed length the theory that describes strong interactions called quantum chromodynamics quark charged with one color value can form bound system with antiquark carrying the corresponding three one each will similarly bound the result two attracting quarks will color quark with color charge plus antiquark with color charge will result color charge white color and the formation analogous the additive color model basic optics the combination three quarks three each with different color will result the same white color charge and the formation baryon modern particle gauge symmetries kind symmetry group relate interactions between particles see gauge theories color commonly abbreviated the gauge symmetry that relates the color charge quarks and the defining symmetry for quantum just the laws physics are independent which directions space are designated and and remain unchanged the coordinate axes are rotated new the physics quantum chromodynamics independent which directions dimensional color space are identified red and color transformations correspond rotations color space mathematically complex space every quark flavor each with subtypes corresponding the quark forms component quantum field which transforms under the fundamental representation the requirement that should local that that its transformations allowed vary with space and time determines the properties the strong particular the existence eight gluon types act its force mass balls proton electron invariant mass two terms are used referring current quark mass refers the mass quark while constituent quark mass refers the current quark mass plus the mass the gluon particle field surrounding the these masses typically have very different most mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks rather than from the quarks while gluons are inherently they possess energy more quantum chromodynamics binding energy and this that contributes greatly the overall mass the hadron see mass special relativity for proton has mass approximately mev which the rest mass its three valence quarks only contributes about much the remainder can attributed the qcbe the standard model posits that elementary particles derive their masses from the higgs mechanism which related the higgs boson physicists hope that further research into the reasons for the top large mass almost the mass gold might reveal more about the origin the mass quarks and other elementary table properties flavor particle the following table summarizes the key properties the six flavor quantum numbers isospin charm strangeness not confused with topness and bottomness are assigned certain quark and denote qualities based systems and the baryon number for all baryons are made three for the

confinement gluon described quantum chromodynamics the strong interaction between quarks mediated massless vector gauge bosons each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor the standard framework particle interactions part more general formulation known perturbation theory gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through virtual emission and absorption when gluon transferred between color change occurs for red quark emits antigreen becomes and green quark absorbs antigreen becomes therefore while each color constantly their strong interaction since gluons carry color they themselves are able emit and absorb other this causes asymptotic freedom quarks come closer each the chromodynamic binding force between them conversely the distance between quarks the binding force the color field becomes much elastic band stressed when and more gluons appropriate color are spontaneously created strengthen the above certain energy pairs quarks and antiquarks are created these pairs bind with the quarks being causing new hadrons this phenomenon known color confinement quarks never appear this process hadronization occurs before formed high energy are able interact any other the only exception the top which may decay before sea quarks hadrons along with the valence quarks that contribute their quantum numbers contain virtual quark antiquark pairs known sea quarks sea quarks form when gluon the color field this process also works reverse that the annihilation two sea quarks produces the result constant flux gluon splits and creations colloquially known the sea quarks are much less stable than their valence and they typically annihilate each other within the interior the despite sea quarks can hadronize into baryonic mesonic particles under certain other phases quark matter qcd matter phase diagram under sufficiently extreme quarks may become deconfined and exist free the course asymptotic freedom the strong interaction becomes weaker higher eventually color confinement would lost and extremely hot plasma freely moving quarks and gluons would this theoretical phase matter called quark gluon plasma the exact conditions needed give rise this state are unknown and have been the subject great deal speculation and recent estimate puts the needed temperature kelvin while state entirely free quarks and gluons has never been achieved despite numerous attempts cern the and recent experiments the relativistic heavy ion collider have yielded evidence for like quark matter exhibiting nearly fluid motion the gluon plasma would characterized great increase the number heavier quark pairs relation the number and down quark believed that the period prior seconds after the big bang the quark epoch the universe was filled with gluon the temperature was too high for hadrons given sufficiently high baryon densities and relatively low temperatures possibly comparable those found neutron stars quark matter expected degenerate
