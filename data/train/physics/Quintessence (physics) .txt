quintessence navigation search quintessence aether physics quintessence hypothetical form dark energy postulated explanation the observation accelerating rate expansion the universe announced has been proposed some physicists fifth fundamental force quintessence differs from the cosmological constant explanation dark energy that that changes over unlike the cosmological constant which always stays suggested that quintessence can either attractive repulsive depending the ratio its kinetic and potential specifically thought that quintessence became repulsive about ten billion years ago the universe approximately billion years contents scalar field tracker behavior specific models quintom scenario terminology references further reading external links scalar field quintessence scalar field with equation state where the ratio pressure and density given the potential energy and kinetic hence quintessence and generally has density and parameter that varies with cosmological constant with fixed energy density and tracker behavior many models quintessence have tracker behavior which according paul steinhardt partly solves the cosmological constant problem these the quintessence field has density which closely tracks but less the radiation density until matter radiation equality which triggers quintessence start having characteristics similar dark energy eventually dominating the this naturally sets the low scale the dark energy when comparing the predicted expansion rate the universe given the tracker solutions with cosmological main feature tracker solutions that one needs four parameters properly describe the behavior their equation state whereas has been shown that most parameter model can optimally constrained term future data horizon specific models some special cases quintessence are phantom energy which and essence short for kinetic quintessence which has standard form kinetic energy this type energy were would cause big rip the universe due the growing energy density dark energy which would cause the expansion the universe increase exponential quintom scenario when scientists fit the evolution dark energy with the cosmological they found that the equation state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary from above proven theorem indicates this called the quintom scenario requires least two degrees freedom for dark energy terminology the name comes from the classical elements ancient the aether pure fifth quinta essentia was thought fill the universe beyond similarly modern quintessence would the fifth known contribution the overall energy content the the other four the modern different from the ancient are baryonic matter radiation photons and the highly relativistic neutrinos which may considered hot dark matter cold dark matter and the term due spatial curvature loosely gravitational self energy
