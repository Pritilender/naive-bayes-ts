millikan onnes planck raman rydberg dinger sommerfeld von neumann weyl wien wigner zeeman zeilinger quantum mechanics the schr dinger equation partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state some physical system changes with was formulated late and published the austrian physicist erwin dinger classical mechanics the equation motion newton second law and equivalent formulations are the euler lagrange equations and hamilton equations all these formulations are used solve for the motion mechanical system and mathematically predict what the system will any time beyond the initial settings and configuration the quantum the analogue law equation for quantum system usually molecules and subatomic particles whether bound not simple algebraic but linear partial differential equation the differential equation describes the wave function the also called the quantum state state the concept state vector fundamental postulate quantum mechanics but although often presented can fact derived from symmetry the standard interpretation quantum mechanics the wave function the most complete description that can given physical solutions equation describe not only molecular atomic and subatomic systems but also macroscopic systems possibly even the whole universe like second law the dinger equation can mathematically transformed into other formulations such werner heisenberg matrix mechanics and richard feynman path integral formulation also like second the dinger equation describes time way that inconvenient for relativistic problem that not severe matrix mechanics and completely absent the path integral citation needed contents equation time dependent equation time independent equation implications total kinetic and potential energy

local conservation probability positive energy analytic continuation diffusion relativistic quantum mechanics quantum field theory see also notes references external links equation time dependent equation the form the dinger equation depends the physical situation see below for special the most general form the time dependent dinger equation which gives description system evolving with time dependent dinger equation where the imaginary unit planck constant divided the symbol indicates partial derivative with respect time the wave function the quantum and the hamiltonian operator which characterizes the total energy any given wave function and takes different forms depending the wave function real part wave function the most famous example the non relativistic schr dinger equation for single particle moving electric field but not magnetic field see the pauli equation time dependent dinger equation single non relativistic particle where the its potential energy the laplacian and the wave function more this called the space wave plain means total energy equals kinetic energy plus potential energy but the terms take unfamiliar forms for reasons explained given the particular differential operators this linear partial differential equation also diffusion equation but unlike the heat equation this one also wave equation given the imaginary unit present the transient the term dinger can refer both the general equation first box the specific nonrelativistic version second box above and variations the general equation indeed quite used throughout quantum for everything from the dirac equation quantum field theory plugging various complicated expressions for the the specific nonrelativistic version simplified approximation which quite accurate many but very inaccurate others see relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory apply the dinger the hamiltonian operator set for the accounting for the kinetic and potential energy the particles constituting the then inserted into the dinger the resulting partial differential equation solved for the wave which contains information about the time independent equation harmonic oscillator probability distribution stationary states standing waves not the independent dinger equation predicts that wave functions can form standing waves called stationary states also called orbitals atomic orbitals molecular orbitals these states are important their own and moreover the stationary states are classified and then becomes easier solve the dependent dinger equation for any state the time independent dinger equation the equation describing stationary only used when the hamiltonian itself not dependent the wave function still has time time independent dinger equation general the equation when the hamiltonian operator acts certain wave function and the result proportional the same wave function then stationary state and the proportionality the energy the state the independent dinger equation discussed further below linear algebra terminology this equation eigenvalue equation the most famous manifestation the non relativistic schr dinger equation for single particle moving electric field but not magnetic time independent dinger equation single relativistic particle with definitions implications the dinger and its introduced breakthrough thinking about schr equation was the first its and solutions led consequences that were very unusual and unexpected for the total kinetic and potential energy the overall form the equation not unusual unexpected uses the principle the conservation energy the terms the nonrelativistic dinger equation can interpreted total energy the equal the system kinetic energy plus the system potential energy this just the same classical quantization the dinger equation predicts that certain properties system are the result may quantized meaning that only specific discrete values can one example energy quantization the energy electron atom always one the quantized energy levels fact discovered via atomic spectroscopy energy quantization discussed below another example quantization angular momentum this was assumption the earlier bohr model the atom but prediction the dinger another result the dinger equation that not every measurement gives quantized result quantum for position momentum time and some energy can have any value across continuous measurement and uncertainty measurement quantum mechanics heisenberg uncertainty principle interpretations quantum mechanics classical particle every exact position and exact these values change deterministically the particle moves according newton laws quantum particles not have exactly determined and when they are the result randomly drawn from probability distribution the dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result each the heisenberg uncertainty principle the statement the inherent measurement uncertainty quantum states that the more precisely position the less precisely its momentum and vice the dinger equation describes the evolution the wave function however even the wave function known the result specific measurement the wave function quantum tunneling quantum tunneling quantum tunneling classical when ball rolled slowly large will come stop and roll because have enough energy get over the top the hill the other however the dinger equation predicts that there small probability that the ball will get the other side the even has too little energy reach the this called quantum tunneling related the uncertainty although the ball seems one side the its position uncertain there chance finding the other particles waves matter wave particle duality slit experiment the nonrelativistic dinger equation type partial differential equation called wave equation therefore often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed most modern interpretations this description reversed the quantum wave the only genuine physical and under the appropriate conditions can show features like two slit diffraction famous example the strange behaviors that waves regularly that are not intuitively associated with the overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out some and reinforce each other other causing complex pattern intuitively one would not expect this pattern from firing single particle the because the particle should pass through one slit the not complex overlap however since the dinger equation wave equation single particle fired through slit does show this same pattern figure note the experiment must repeated many times for the complex pattern the appearance the pattern proves that each electron passes through both slits although this the prediction electron diffraction and neutron diffraction are well understood and widely used science and related diffraction particles also display superposition and interference the superposition property allows the particle quantum superposition two more states with different classical properties the same for particle can have several different energies the same and can several different locations the same the above particle can pass through two slits the same this superposition still single quantum shown the interference even though that conflicts with classical interpretation the wave function interpretations quantum mechanics the dinger equation provides way calculate the possible wave functions system and how they dynamically change however the dinger equation does not directly say what exactly the wave function interpretations quantum mechanics address questions such what the relation between the wave the underlying and the results experimental important aspect the relationship between the dinger equation and wavefunction collapse the oldest copenhagen interpretation particles follow the dinger equation except during wavefunction during which they behave entirely the advent quantum decoherence theory allowed alternative approaches such the everett worlds interpretation and consistent histories wherein the dinger equation always satisfied and wavefunction collapse should explained consequence the dinger historical background and development theoretical and experimental justification for the dinger equation following max planck quantization light see black body radiation albert einstein interpreted quanta photons particles light and proposed that the energy photon proportional its frequency one the first signs wave particle duality since energy and momentum are related the same way frequency and wavenumber special relativity followed that the momentum photon inversely proportional its wavelength proportional its wavenumber where planck constant louis broglie hypothesized that this true for all even particles such showed assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle electrons form standing waves meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus atom are these quantized orbits correspond discrete energy levels and broglie reproduced the bohr model formula for the energy the bohr model was based the assumed quantization angular momentum according according broglie the electron described wave and whole number wavelengths must fit along the circumference the this approach essentially confined the electron wave one along circular orbit radius prior arthur lunn the university chicago had used the same argument based the completion the relativistic momentum vector derive what now call the broglie relation unlike lunn went formulate the differential equation now known the dinger and solve for its energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen unfortunately the paper was rejected the physical recounted following physicist peter debye made offhand comment that particles behaved they should satisfy some sort wave inspired schr dinger decided find proper dimensional wave equation for the was guided william hamilton analogy between mechanics and optics encoded the observation that the wavelength limit optics resembles mechanical system the trajectories light rays become sharp tracks that obey fermat principle analog the principle least action modern version his reasoning reproduced the equation found however that arnold sommerfeld had refined the bohr model with relativistic corrections schr dinger used the relativistic energy momentum relation find what now known the klein gordon equation coulomb potential natural units found the standing waves this relativistic but the relativistic corrections disagreed with discouraged put away his calculations and secluded himself isolated mountain cabin december while the schr dinger decided that his earlier relativistic calculations were novel enough and decided leave off the problem relativistic corrections for the despite difficulties solving the differential equation for hydrogen had later help from his friend the mathematician hermann weyl schr dinger showed that his relativistic version the wave equation produced the correct spectral energies hydrogen paper published the schr dinger computed the hydrogen spectral series treating hydrogen atom electron wave moving potential well created the proton this computation accurately reproduced the energy levels the bohr model schr dinger himself explained this equation this paper was enthusiastically endorsed who saw the waves intuitive depiction opposed matrix mechanics which considered overly the dinger equation details the behavior but says nothing its nature schr dinger tried interpret charge density his fourth but was just few days after fourth and final paper was max born successfully interpreted the probability amplitude whose absolute square equal probability density schr though always opposed statistical probabilistic with its associated discontinuities much like who believed that quantum mechanics was statistical approximation underlying deterministic theory and never reconciled with the copenhagen interpretation louis broglie his later years proposed real valued wave function connected the complex wave function proportionality constant and developed the bohm theory the wave equation for particles wave particle duality the dinger equation mathematically wave equation since the solutions are functions which describe like wave equations physics can normally derived from other physical laws the wave equation for mechanical vibrations strings and matter can derived from newton laws where the wave function represents the displacement and electromagnetic waves from maxwell equations where the wave functions are electric and magnetic fields the basis for the other the energy the system and separate postulate quantum mechanics the wave function description the the therefore new concept feynman put the equation structured linear differential equation based classical energy and consistent with the broglie the solution the wave function which contains all the information that can known about the the copenhagen interpretation the modulus related the probability the particles are some spatial configuration some instant solving the equation for can used predict how the particles will behave under the influence the specified potential and with each the dinger equation was developed principally from the broglie hypothesis wave equation that would describe and can constructed shown informally the following for more rigorous description see consistency with energy conservation the total energy particle the sum kinetic energy and potential energy this sum also the frequent expression for the hamiltonian classical explicitly for particle one dimension with position mass and momentum and potential energy which generally varies with position and time for three the position vector and momentum vector must this formalism can extended any fixed number the total energy the system then the total kinetic energies the plus the total potential again the however there can interactions between the particles body problem the potential energy can change the spatial configuration particles and possibly with the potential not the sum the separate potential energies for each function all the spatial positions the explicitly linearity the simplest wavefunction plane wave the where the the the and the angular the plane physical situations are not purely described plane for generality the superposition principle any wave can made superposition sinusoidal plane the equation linear combination plane waves also allowed hence necessary and separate requirement that the dinger equation linear differential equation for discrete the sum superposition plane for some real amplitude coefficients and for continuous the sum becomes the fourier transform momentum space where the differential volume element space and the integrals are taken over all the momentum wavefunction arises the integrand since the position and momentum space wavefunctions are fourier transforms each consistency with the broglie relations einstein light quanta hypothesis states that the energy photon proportional the frequency angular frequency the corresponding quantum wavepacket likewise hypothesis states that any particle can associated with and that the momentum the particle inversely proportional the wavelength such wave proportional the wavenumber one while three wavelength related the magnitude the wavevector the einstein and broglie relations illuminate the deep connections between energy with and space with and express wave particle duality natural units comprising are the broglie equations reduce identities allowing wavenumber energy and frequency used prevent duplication and reduce the number dimensions related for familiarity units are still used this schr citation needed late was express the phase plane wave complex phase factor using these and realize that the first order partial derivatives with respect space and time another postulate quantum mechanics that all observables are represented linear hermitian operators which act the and the eigenvalues the operator are the values the observable the previous derivatives are consistent with the energy operator corresponding the time where are the energy eigenvalues and the momentum operator corresponding the spatial derivatives the gradient where vector the momentum the the hats indicate these observables are not simply ordinary numbers the energy and momentum operators are differential operators while the potential energy function just multiplicative substituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the terms derivatives with respect time and acting this operator the wavefunction immediately led dinger his citation needed particle duality can assessed from these equations the kinetic energy related the square momentum the momentum the kinetic energy increases more but since the wavenumber increases the wavelength decreases terms ordinary scalar and vector quantities not the kinetic energy also proportional the second spatial also proportional the magnitude the curvature the terms the curvature the amplitude the wave alternates between positive and negative more and also shortens the the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength consistent with the energy the particle and the energy the particle has connection all the same mathematical wave and particle motion wavepacket schr dinger required that wave packet solution near position with wavevector near will move along the trajectory determined classical mechanics for times short enough for the spread and hence not substantially increase the spread since for given spread the spread velocity proportional constant sometimes said that the limit approaches the equations classical mechanics are restored from quantum great care required how that limit and what the limiting wavelength equivalent tending zero because this limiting case increasing the wave packet localization the definite position the particle see images using the heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and the products uncertainty position and momentum become zero where denotes the root mean measurement uncertainty and and similarly for the and directions which implies the position and momentum can only known arbitrary precision this the dinger equation its general form closely related the hamilton jacobi equation where action and the hamiltonian function not here the generalized coordinates for used the context the can set the position cartesian coordinates substituting where the probability into the dinger equation and then taking the limit the resulting yields the jacobi the implications the motion described wave packet solution the dinger also described the jacobi equation the dinger equation includes the its wave packet solution implies the position particle fuzzily spread out wave the the jacobi equation applies particle definite position and instead the position and momentum all times the are deterministic and can simultaneously non relativistic quantum mechanics the quantum mechanics particles without accounting for the effects special relativity for example particles propagating speeds much less than light known non relativistic quantum mechanics following are several forms equation this context for different time independence and one and three spatial and one and particles the particles constituting the system not have the numerical labels used the language mathematics forces label the positions particles one way otherwise there would confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which time independent the hamiltonian not explicit function the equation separable into product spatial and temporal the wavefunction takes the where space function all the spatial the constituting the system and function time substituting for into the dinger equation for the relevant number particles the relevant number solving separation variables implies the general solution the dependent equation has the since the time dependent phase factor always the only the spatial part needs solved for time independent additionally the energy operator can always replaced the energy eigenvalue thus the time independent dinger equation eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian this true for any number particles any number dimensions time independent this case describes the standing wave solutions the dependent which are the states with definite energy instead probability distribution different these standing waves are called stationary states energy eigenstates chemistry they are called atomic orbitals molecular orbitals superpositions energy eigenstates change their properties according the relative phases between the energy the energy eigenvalues from this equation form

general perturbation theory the variational method quantum monte carlo methods density functional theory the wkb approximation and classical expansion methods for special list mechanical systems with analytical solutions fock method and post fock methods properties the dinger equation has the following some are but there are ultimately these properties arise from the hamiltonian and solutions the linearity linear differential equation the development the dinger equation was made linear for though this has other two wave functions and are then any linear combination the where and are any complex numbers the sum can extended for any number this property allows superpositions quantum states solutions the dinger even more holds that general solution the dinger equation can found taking weighted sum over all single state solutions for consider wave function such that the wave function product two one time and one time states definite energy found using the time independent dinger equation are given with amplitude and time dependent phase factor given then valid general solution the ability scale solutions allows one solve for wave function without normalizing one has set normalized solutions then can normalized ensuring that this much more convenient than having verify that real energy eigenstates for the independent additional feature linearity two wave functions and are solutions the independent equation with the same energy then any linear two different solutions with the same energy are called degenerate arbitrary wave function solves the independent does its complex conjugate taking linear the real and imaginary parts are each there degeneracy they can only differ the dependent complex conjugate waves move opposite one then the symmetry complex conjugation called time reversal symmetry space and time derivatives the dinger equation first order time and second which describes the time evolution quantum state meaning determines the future amplitude from the explicitly for one particle cartesian coordinates the equation the first time partial derivative implies the initial value the wavefunction arbitrary likewise the second order derivatives with respect space implies the wavefunction and its first order spatial derivatives are all arbitrary constants given set where are set points describing boundary derivatives are evaluated the typically there are one two such the step potential and particle box respectively the first order derivatives are the wavefunction can continuously differentiable function since any boundary the gradient the wavefunction can the wave equations physics are usually second order time notable are the family classical wave equations and the quantum klein gordon equation local conservation probability probability current continuity equation the dinger equation consistent with probability conservation multiplying the dinger equation the right the complex conjugate and multiplying the wavefunction the left the complex conjugate the dinger and gives the continuity equation for where the probability density probability per unit denotes complex conjugate and the probability current flow per unit hence predictions from the dinger equation not violate probability positive energy the potential bounded from meaning there minimum value potential the eigenfunctions the dinger equation have energy which also bounded from this can seen most easily using the variational principle see also for any linear operator bounded from the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue the vector that minimizes the quantity over all which are normalized this the smallest eigenvalue expressed through the variational principle for the dinger hamiltonian bounded from the smallest eigenvalue called the ground state that energy the minimum value using integration parts due the complex modulus squared which positive the right hand side always greater than the lowest value the ground state energy positive when everywhere for potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over there ground state which minimizes the integral this lowest energy wavefunction real and positive definite meaning the wavefunction can increase and but positive for all physically cannot smoothing out the bends the sign change minimize the rapidly reduces the gradient contribution the integral and hence the kinetic while the potential energy changes linearly and less the kinetic and potential energy are both changing different the total energy not which happen the solutions are consistent with dinger equation this wavefunction positive the lack sign changes also shows that the ground state since there were two ground states with common energy not proportional each there would linear combination the two that would also ground state resulting zero analytic continuation diffusion path integral formulation the dinger the above properties positive definiteness allow the analytic continuation the dinger equation identified stochastic process this can interpreted the huygens fresnel principle applied broglie the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability for particle random walk again for which the continuation substituting into the dependent dinger equation which has the same form the diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient relativistic quantum mechanics relativistic quantum mechanics obtained where quantum mechanics and special relativity simultaneously the general form the dinger equation still but the hamiltonian operators are much less and more one wishes build relativistic wave equations from the relativistic energy momentum relation instead classical energy the klein gordon equation and the dirac equation are two such the gordon equation was the first such equation even before the relativistic and applies massive spinless the dirac equation arose from taking the square the gordon equation factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into product two operators one these the operator for the entire dirac the dirac equation introduces spin matrices the particular case the dirac equation they are the gamma matrices for spin particles and the solutions are component spinor fields with two components corresponding the particle and the other two for the the hamiltonian substituted the general dinger equation not just function position and momentum but also spin also the solutions relativistic wave for massive particle spin are valued component spinor fields quantum field theory the general equation also valid and used quantum field
