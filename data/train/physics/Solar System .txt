nicolaus copernicus was the first develop mathematically predictive heliocentric system his century galileo galilei johannes kepler and isaac newton developed understanding physics that led the gradual acceptance the idea that earth moves around the sun and that the planets are governed the same physical laws that governed additionally the invention the telescope led the discovery further

tiny particles that orbit them most the largest natural satellites are synchronous rotation with one face permanently turned toward their kepler laws planetary motion describe the orbits objects about the following each object travels along ellipse with the sun one focus objects closer the sun with smaller semi major axes travel more quickly because they are more affected the elliptical distance from the sun varies over the course its closest approach the sun called its perihelion whereas its most distant point from the sun called its aphelion the orbits the planets are nearly but many asteroids and kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical the positions the bodies the solar system can predicted using numerical models although the sun dominates the system accounts for only about the angular momentum due the differential rotation within the gaseous the dominated account for most the rest the angular momentum due the combination their orbit and distance from the with possibly significant contribution from the which comprises nearly all the matter the solar composed roughly hydrogen and jupiter and saturn which comprise nearly all the remaining possess atmospheres composed roughly these composition gradient exists the solar created heat and light pressure from the those objects closer the which are more affected heat and light are composed elements with high melting

protoplanetary nebula jupiter and saturn are composed mainly the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure such molecular hydrogen helium and neon

evolution the solar system the solar system formed billion years ago from the gravitational collapse region within large molecular cloud this initial cloud was likely several years across and probably birthed several typical molecular this one consisted mostly with some and small amounts heavier elements fused previous generations the region that would become the solar known the pre solar nebula collapsed conservation angular momentum caused rotate the where most the mass became increasingly hotter than the surrounding the contracting nebula rotated began flatten into protoplanetary disc with diameter roughly and dense protostar the the planets formed accretion from this which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each coalescing form ever larger hundreds protoplanets may have existed the early solar but they either merged were leaving the dwarf and leftover minor bodies due their higher boiling only metals and silicates could exist solid form the warm inner solar system close the and these would eventually form the rocky planets venus earth and because metallic elements only comprised very small fraction the solar the terrestrial planets could not grow very the giant planets saturn uranus and formed further beyond the frost the point between the orbits mars and jupiter where material cool enough for volatile icy compounds remain the ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner allowing them grow massive enough capture large atmospheres hydrogen and the lightest and most abundant leftover debris that never became planets congregated regions such the asteroid belt kuiper belt and oort cloud the nice model explanation for the creation these regions and how the outer planets could have formed different positions and migrated their current orbits through various gravitational within million the pressure and density hydrogen the centre the protostar became great enough for begin thermonuclear fusion the reaction pressure and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was the thermal pressure equalled the force this the sun became main sequence star solar wind from the sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar ending the planetary formation the solar system will remain roughly know today until the hydrogen the core the sun has been entirely converted which will occur roughly billion years from this will mark the end the sequence this the core the sun will and the energy output will much greater than the outer layers the sun will expand roughly times its current and the sun will become red giant because its vastly increased surface the surface the sun will considerably cooler its than the main the expanding sun expected vaporize mercury and venus and render earth uninhabitable the habitable zone moves out the orbit eventually the core will hot enough for helium the sun will burn helium for fraction the time burned hydrogen the the sun not massive enough commence the fusion heavier and nuclear reactions the core will its outer layers will move away into leaving white dwarf extraordinarily dense half the original mass the sun but only the size the ejected outer layers will form what known planetary nebula returning some the material that formed the but now enriched with heavier elements like the interstellar sun sun the sun the solar star and far its chief its large mass earth produces temperatures and densities its core high enough sustain nuclear fusion which releases enormous amounts energy mostly radiated into space electromagnetic radiation peaking the band visible light the sun type main sequence star compared the majority stars the milky way the sun rather large and stars are classified the hertzsprung russell diagram graph that plots the brightness stars with their surface temperatures generally hotter stars are stars following this pattern are said the main sequence and the sun lies right the middle stars brighter and hotter than the sun are whereas substantially dimmer and cooler known red dwarfs are making the stars the evidence suggests that the position the main sequence puts the prime for not yet having exhausted its store hydrogen for nuclear the sun growing early its history its brightness was that what the sun population star was born the later stages the universe evolution and thus contains more elements heavier than hydrogen and helium metals astronomical than the older population elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed the cores ancient and exploding the first generation stars had die before the universe could enriched with these the oldest stars contain few whereas stars born later have this high metallicity thought have been crucial the development planetary system because the planets form from the accretion metals interplanetary medium heliospheric current sheet interplanetary medium heliosphere the vast majority the solar system consists vacuum known the interplanetary medium along with light the sun radiates continuous stream charged particles plasma known the solar wind this stream particles spreads outwards roughly million kilometres thousand per creating tenuous atmosphere the that permeates the interplanetary medium out least see heliopause activity the such solar flares and coronal mass ejections disturb the creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms the largest structure within the heliosphere the heliospheric current sheet spiral form created the actions the rotating magnetic field the interplanetary earth magnetic field stops its atmosphere from being stripped away the solar venus and mars not have magnetic and result the solar wind causing their atmospheres gradually bleed away into coronal mass ejections and similar events blow magnetic field and huge quantities material from the surface the the interaction this magnetic field and material with magnetic field funnels charged particles into upper where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields for those planets

zodiacal light was likely formed collisions within the asteroid belt brought interactions with the the second dust cloud extends from about about and was probably created similar collisions within the kuiper belt inner solar system the inner solar system the traditional name for the region comprising the terrestrial planets and composed mainly silicates and the objects the inner solar system are relatively close the the radius this entire region shorter than the distance between the orbits jupiter and inner planets terrestrial planet earth mars venus mercury the four inner terrestrial planets have rocky compositions few moons and ring systems they are composed largely refractory minerals such the silicates which form their crusts and mantles and such iron and nickel which form their cores three the four inner planets earth and have atmospheres substantial enough generate weather all have impact craters and tectonic surface such rift valleys and volcanoes the term inner planet should

tectonics oxygen moon mars mars carbon dioxide olympus mons valles marineris iron oxide deimos phobos asteroids asteroid belt asteroid belt asteroid belt jupiter trojans hildas earth asteroids asteroids are small solar system bodies composed mainly refractory rocky and metallic minerals with some the asteroid belt occupies the orbit between mars and between and from the thought remnants from the solar formation that failed coalesce because the gravitational interference asteroids range size from hundreds kilometres across all asteroids except the ceres are classified small solar

routinely pass through without asteroids with diameters between and are called meteoroids ceres ceres the largest protoplanet and dwarf has diameter slightly under and mass large enough for its own gravity pull into spherical ceres was considered planet when was discovered and was reclassified asteroid the further observations revealed additional was classified dwarf planet asteroid groups asteroids the asteroid belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based their orbital asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger they are not clearly distinguished planetary sometimes

tenth even hundredth the mass many kuiper belt objects have multiple and most have orbits that take them outside the plane the the kuiper belt can roughly divided into the classical belt and the resonances resonances are orbits linked that neptune twice for every three neptune once for every the first resonance begins within the orbit neptune the classical belt consists objects having

orbits the gravitational influence neptune early outward migration most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond some more than from the sdos orbits are also
