planetary surfaces outer limits notable events see also notes references external links history the existence continuous stream particles flowing outward from the sun was first suggested british astronomer richard carrington carrington and richard hodgson independently made the first observation what would later called solar flare this sudden outburst energy from the the following geomagnetic storm was and carrington suspected that there might george fitzgerald later suggested that matter was being regularly accelerated away from the sun and was reaching the earth after several birkeland currents terrella british astrophysicist arthur eddington essentially suggested the existence the solar without naming footnote article comet morehouse the idea never fully caught even though eddington had also made similar suggestion royal institution address the previous the latter postulated that the ejected material consisted electrons while his study comet morehouse supposed them the first person suggest that they were both was norwegian physicist kristian birkeland his geomagnetic surveys showed that auroral activity was nearly these displays and other geomagnetic activity were being produced particles from the concluded that the earth was being continually bombarded rays electric corpuscles emitted the birkeland proposed from physical point view most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive but both other the solar wind consists both negative electrons and positive ions three years later frederick lindemann also suggested that particles both protons well come from the around the scientists had determined that the temperature the solar corona must million degrees celsius because the way stood out into space seen during total later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary the the british mathematician sydney chapman calculated the properties gas such temperature and determined was such superb conductor heat that must extend way out into beyond the orbit also the german scientist named ludwig biermann became interested the fact that matter whether comet headed towards away from the its tail always points away from the biermann postulated that this happens because the sun emits steady stream particles that pushes the tail wilfried der claims his who first discovered the solar that the german astronomer paul ahnert was the first relate solar wind comet tail direction based observations the comet fedke eugene parker realised that the heat flowing from the sun model and the comet tail blowing away from the sun hypothesis had the result the same which termed the solar parker showed that even though the corona strongly attracted solar such good conductor heat that still very hot large since gravity weakens distance from the sun the outer coronal atmosphere escapes supersonically into interstellar furthermore parker was the first person notice that the weakening effect the gravity has the same effect hydrodynamic flow laval nozzle incites transition from subsonic supersonic flow opposition hypothesis the solar wind was the paper submitted the astrophysical journal was rejected two was saved the editor subrahmanyan chandrasekhar who later received the nobel prize january the soviet satellite luna first directly observed the solar wind and measured its they were detected hemispherical ion the made konstantin gringauz was verified luna luna and the more distant measurements venera three years later its measurement was performed americans neugebauer and using the mariner spacecraft the late the ultraviolet coronal spectrometer instrument board the soho spacecraft observed the acceleration region the fast solar wind emanating from the poles the and found that the wind accelerates much faster than can accounted for thermodynamic expansion parker model predicted that the wind should make the transition supersonic flow altitude about solar radii from the photosphere but the transition sonic now appears much perhaps only solar radius above the suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the the acceleration the fast wind still not understood and cannot fully explained the gravitational and electromagnetic explanation for this acceleration however detailed earlier paper nobel laureate for physics hannes the first numerical simulation the solar wind the solar corona including closed and open field lines was performed pneuman and kopp the magnetohydrodynamics equations steady state were solved iteratively starting with initial dipolar configuration the ulysses probe was launched study the solar wind from high solar all prior observations had been made near the solar ecliptic plane emission while early models the solar wind used primarily thermal energy accelerate the the was clear that thermal acceleration alone cannot account for the high speed solar additional unknown acceleration mechanism and likely relates magnetic fields the solar the corona extended outer region plasma that heated over million degrees result thermal the particles within the inner corona have range and distribution speeds described maxwellian distribution the mean velocity these particles about which well below the solar escape velocity however few the particles achieve energies sufficient reach the terminal velocity which allows them feed the solar the same electrons due their much smaller reach escape velocity and build electric field that further accelerates ions charged atoms away from the the total number particles carried away from the sun the solar wind about per thus the total mass loss each year about solar masses about one billion kilograms per this equivalent losing mass equal the earth every million however only about the total mass has been lost through the solar other stars have much stronger stellar winds that result significantly higher mass loss components and speed the solar wind divided into two respectively termed the slow solar wind and the fast solar the slow solar wind has velocity about temperature and composition that close match the corona the fast solar wind has typical velocity temperature and nearly matches the composition the photosphere the slow solar wind twice dense and more variable intensity than the fast solar the slow wind also has more complex with turbulent regions and scale the slow solar wind appears originate from region around the equatorial belt that known the streamer coronal streamers extend outward from this carrying plasma from the interior along closed magnetic observations the sun between and showed that emission the slow solar wind occurred between latitudes around the equator during the solar minimum the period lowest solar then expanded toward the poles the minimum the time the solar maximum the poles were also emitting slow solar the fast solar wind thought originate from coronal holes which are like regions open field lines the magnetic field such open lines are particularly prevalent around the magnetic the plasma source small magnetic fields created convection cells the solar these fields confine the plasma and transport into the narrow necks the coronal which are located only kilometers above the the plasma released into the funnel when these magnetic field lines solar wind pressure the wind exerts pressure typically the range npa although can readily vary outside that the dynamic pressure function wind speed and the formula where pressure npa nano the density and the speed the solar coronal mass ejection coronal mass ejection both the fast and slow solar wind can interrupted fast moving bursts plasma called interplanetary coronal mass ejections icmes are the interplanetary manifestation solar coronal mass ejections which are caused release magnetic energy the cmes are often called solar space the popular they are but not associated with solar flares which are another manifestation magnetic energy release the icmes cause shock waves the thin plasma the launching electromagnetic waves and accelerating particles mostly protons and electrons form showers ionizing radiation that precede the when cme impacts the magnetosphere temporarily deforms the magnetic field changing the direction compass needles and inducing large electrical ground currents earth this called geomagnetic storm and global cme impacts can induce magnetic reconnection magnetotail the midnight side the magnetosphere this launches protons and electrons downward toward where they form the aurora icmes are not the only cause space weather different patches the sun are known give rise slightly different speeds and densities wind depending local each these different wind streams would form spiral with slightly different with moving streams moving out more directly and moving streams wrapping more around the fast moving streams tend overtake slower streams that originate westward them the forming turbulent rotating interaction regions that give rise wave motions and accelerated and that affect magnetosphere the same way but more gently cmes effect the solar system space weather over the lifetime the the interaction the surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation the wind considered responsible for the tails along with the the solar wind contributes fluctuations celestial radio waves observed the through effect called interplanetary scintillation magnetospheres magnetosphere the solar wind approaches planet that has developed magnetic field such jupiter and the particles are deflected the lorentz force this known the magnetosphere causes the particles travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere the magnetosphere roughly shaped like hemisphere the side facing the then drawn out long wake the opposite the boundary this region called the magnetopause and some the particles are able penetrate the magnetosphere through this region partial reconnection the magnetic field the solar wind responsible for the overall shape magnetosphere and fluctuations its density direction and entrained magnetic field strongly affect local space for the levels ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary factors hundreds and the shape and location the magnetopause and bow shock wave upstream can change several earth exposing geosynchronous satellites the direct solar these phenomena are collectively called space weather from the european space cluster mission new study has taken place that proposes easier for the solar wind infiltrate the magnetosphere than had been previously group scientists directly observed the existence certain waves the solar wind that were not recent publishing the journal geophysical research shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles solar wind breach the this suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more filter than continuous this latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement the four identical cluster which fly strictly controlled configuration through earth they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back the fleet provides exceptional dimensional insights the processes that connect the sun the team scientists was able characterize how variances imf formation largely influenced helmholtz waves which occur upon the interface two result differences thickness and numerous other characteristics the boundary experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance helmholtz waves the magnetopause has displayed high latitude dawnward orientation the these waves being seen unforeseeable places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed undesired for their the discoveries found through this mission are great importance esa project scientists because shows how magnetosphere can penetrated solar particles under specific interplanetary magnetic field the findings are also relevant studies magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies the solar this study suggests that helmholtz waves can somewhat and possibly instrument for the entrance solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various imf atmospheres the solar wind affects the other incoming cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere moreover planets with weak existent magnetosphere are subject atmospheric stripping the solar venus the nearest and most similar planet earth the solar has atmosphere times denser than our with little magnetic modern space probes have discovered like tail that extends the orbit the earth itself largely protected from the solar wind its magnetic field which deflects most the charged however some the charged particles are trapped the van allen radiation belt smaller number particles from the solar wind manage though electromagnetic energy transmission the upper atmosphere and ionosphere the auroral the only time the solar wind observable the earth when strong enough produce phenomena such the aurora and geomagnetic storms bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere causing its plasma expand into the increasing the size the plasma geosphere and causing escape atmospheric matter into the solar geomagnetic storms result when the pressure plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere sufficiently large inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic mars larger than mercury and four times farther from the and yet even here thought that the solar wind has stripped away third its original leaving layer dense the believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping gas being caught bubbles magnetic which are ripped off solar planetary surfaces mercury the nearest planet the bears the full brunt the solar and its atmosphere vestigial and its surface bathed mercury has intrinsic magnetic under normal solar wind the solar wind cannot penetrate the magnetosphere created around the and particles only reach the surface the cusp during coronal mass however the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface the and under these the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary the moon has atmosphere intrinsic magnetic field and consequently its surface bombarded with the full solar the project apollo missions deployed passive aluminum collectors attempt sample the solar and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar regolith enriched atomic nuclei deposited from the solar there has been speculation that these elements may prove useful resources for future lunar outer limits heliopause the solar wind blows the interstellar medium the rarefied hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the the point where the solar strength longer great enough push back the interstellar medium known the heliopause and often considered the outer border the solar the distance the heliopause not precisely and probably varies widely depending the current velocity the solar wind and the local density the interstellar but known lie far outside the orbit pluto scientists hope gain more perspective the heliopause from data acquired through the interstellar boundary explorer mission launched october notable events from may may nasa advanced composition explorer and wind spacecraft observed decrease solar wind this allowed energetic electrons from the sun flow earth narrow beams known strahl which caused highly unusual polar event which visible aurora appeared over the north earth magnetosphere increased between and times its normal see also the solar variation entry december voyager determined that the velocity the solar its location billion miles from earth has now slowed have gotten the point where the wind from the which until now has always had outward longer moving only moving sideways that can
