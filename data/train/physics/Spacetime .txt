any mathematical model that combines space and time into single interwoven continuum the spacetime our universe usually interpreted from euclidean space perspective which regards space consisting three dimensions and time consisting one dimension the fourth dimension combining space and time into single manifold called minkowski space physicists have significantly simplified large number physical theories well described more uniform way the workings the universe both the supergalactic and subatomic levels relativistic classical mechanics the use euclidean space instead spacetime time treated universal and constant being independent the state motion observer relativistic contexts time cannot separated from the three dimensions because the observed rate which time passes for object depends the velocity relative the observer and also the strength gravitational fields which can slow the passage time for object seen observer outside the cosmology the concept spacetime combines space and time single abstract universe mathematically manifold consisting events which are described some type coordinate system typically three spatial dimensions width height and one temporal dimension time are dimensions are independent components coordinate grid needed locate point certain defined space for the globe the latitude and longitude are two independent coordinates which together uniquely determine coordinate grid that spans the dimensions locates events rather than just points time added another dimension the coordinate this way the coordinates specify where and when events however the unified nature spacetime and the freedom coordinate choice allows imply that express the temporal coordinate one coordinate system requires both temporal and spatial coordinates another coordinate unlike normal spatial there are still restrictions for how measurements can made spatially and temporally see spacetime intervals these restrictions correspond roughly particular mathematical model which differs from euclidean space its manifest symmetry until the beginning the time was believed independent progressing fixed rate all reference frames however later experiments revealed that time slows higher speeds the reference frame relative another reference such called time dilation explained special relativity theory many experiments have confirmed time such the relativistic decay muons from cosmic ray showers and the slowing atomic clocks aboard space shuttle relative synchronized bound inertial the duration time can therefore vary according events and reference frames when dimensions are understood mere components the grid rather than physical attributes easier understand the alternate dimensional views being simply the result coordinate transformations the term spacetime has taken generalized meaning beyond treating spacetime events with the normal dimensions really the combination space and other proposed spacetime theories include additional normally spatial but there exist some speculative theories that include additional temporal dimensions and even some that include dimensions that are neither temporal nor spatial superspace how many dimensions are needed describe the universe still open speculative theories such string theory predict dimensions with theory predicting dimensions spatial and temporal but the existence more

under the term dimension jean rond alembert speculated that duration might considered fourth dimension the idea was not too another early venture was joseph louis lagrange his theory analytic functions one may view mechanics geometry four and mechanical analysis extension geometric the ancient idea the cosmos gradually was described mathematically with differential equations differential geometry and abstract algebra these mathematical articulations blossomed the nineteenth century electrical technology stimulated men like michael faraday and james clerk maxwell describe the reciprocal relations electric and magnetic daniel siegel phrased role relativity instantaneously distance maxwell used vortex models his papers physical lines force but ultimately gave any substance but the electromagnetic pierre duhem wrote displacement currents this very abstract view the electromagnetic involving visualizable picture what going out there the describing the behaviour electric fields and magnetic fields led maxwell unified view electromagnetic field being functions these fields took values domain piece the intermingling electric and magnetic described maxwell equations that give spacetime its the rate motion observer determines the electric and magnetic profiles the electromagnetic the propagation the field determined the electromagnetic wave equation which also requires spacetime for spacetime was described affine space with quadratic form minkowski space his textbook the theory relativity ludwik silberstein used biquaternions represent events minkowski also exhibited the lorentz transformations between observers differing velocities biquaternion biquaternions were described hamilton while the physical interpretation was the mathematics was known english making relativity instance applied the thirteenth edition the encyclop dia britannica included article einstein titled the first inkling general relativity spacetime was articulated clifford description the effect gravitation space and time was found most easily visualized warp stretching the geometrical fabric space and smooth and continuous way that changed smoothly from point along the spacetime basic concepts spacetimes are the arenas which all physical events take event point spacetime specified its time and for the motion planets around the sun may described particular type the motion light around rotating star may described another type the basic elements spacetime are any given event unique position unique because events are spacetime example event classical relativistic physics the location elementary particle particular spacetime itself can viewed the union all events the same way that line the union all its formally organized into manifold space which can described small scales using coordinate spacetime independent any however describing physical phenomena which occur certain moments time given region each observer chooses convenient metrical coordinate system events are specified four real numbers any such coordinate the trajectories elementary particles through space and time are thus continuum events called the world line the extended composite objects consisting many elementary are thus union many world lines twisted together virtue their interactions through spacetime into however common treat extended object particle field with its own unique center position any given that the world line particle light beam the path that this particle beam takes the spacetime and represents the history the particle the world line the orbit the earth such depicted two spatial dimensions and the plane the and time dimension orthogonal and the orbit the earth ellipse space but its world line helix the unification space and time exemplified the common practice selecting metric the measure that specifies the interval between two events such that all four dimensions are measured terms units representing event the lorentz the original minkowski where the speed light the metrical descriptions minkowski space and lightlike and timelike intervals given below follow this the conventional formulations the lorentz transformation spacetime intervals euclidean space the separation between two points measured the distance between the two the distance purely and always the separation between two events measured the invariant interval between the two which takes into account not only the spatial separation between the but also their temporal the between two events defined where the speed and and denote differences the space and time respectively between the the choice signs for above follows the space like convention the reason called the interval and not that can zero spacetime intervals may classified into three distinct based whether the temporal separation the spatial separation the two events time light like certain types world lines are called geodesics the spacetime straight lines the case minkowski space and their closest equivalent the curved spacetime general the case like separated these are the paths greatest like separation spacetime between the two whereas euclidean space and riemannian geodesics are paths shortest distance between the concept geodesics becomes critical general relativity since geodesic motion may thought pure inertial motion that free from any external time like interval for two events separated like enough time passes between them that there could effect relationship between the two for particle traveling through space less than the speed any two events which occur the particle must separated like event pairs with like separation define negative squared spacetime interval and may said occur each future there exists reference frame such that the two events are observed occur the same spatial but there reference frame which the two events can occur the same the measure like spacetime interval described the proper time the proper time interval would measured observer with clock traveling between the two events inertial reference when the path intersects each event that event the proper time defines real number since the interior the square root light like interval like the spatial distance between two events exactly balanced the time between the two the events define squared spacetime interval zero light like intervals are also known null intervals events which occur are initiated photon along its path while traveling the speed all have like given one all those events which follow like intervals define the propagation light cone and all the events which preceded from like interval define second graphically which say pastward light space like interval when like interval separates two not enough time passes between their occurrences for there exist causal relationship crossing the spatial distance between the two events the speed light generally the events are considered not occur each future there exists reference frame such that the two events are observed occur the same but there reference frame which the two events can occur the same spatial for these like event pairs with positive squared spacetime interval the measurement like separation the proper distance like the proper time like the proper distance like spacetime intervals real number mathematics spacetimes for physical spacetime continuum mathematically defined smooth connected lorentzian manifold this means the smooth lorentz metric has signature the metric determines the geometry well determining the geodesics particles and light about each point this coordinate charts are used represent observers reference usually cartesian coordinates are moreover for units measurement are usually chosen such that the speed light equal reference frame can identified with one these coordinate any such observer can describe any event another reference frame may identified second coordinate chart about two observers one each reference may describe the same event but obtain different usually many overlapping coordinate charts are needed cover given two coordinate one containing representing and another containing representing another the intersection the charts represents the region spacetime which both observers can measure physical quantities and hence compare the relation between the two sets measurements given non singular coordinate transformation this the idea coordinate charts local observers who can perform measurements their vicinity also makes good physical this how one actually collects physical for two one whom but the other one who fast rocket may observe comet crashing into jupiter this the event they will disagree about the exact location and timing this they will have different tuples they are using different coordinate although their kinematic descriptions will dynamical laws such momentum conservation and the first law will still relativity theory requires more than this the sense that stipulates these and all other laws must take the same form all coordinate this introduces tensors into which all physical quantities are geodesics are said null like the tangent vector one point the geodesic this paths particles and light beams spacetime are represented like and null geodesics respectively topology spacetime topology the assumptions contained the definition spacetime are usually justified the following the connectedness assumption serves two main first different observers making measurements represented coordinate should able compare their observations the empty intersection the the connectedness assumption were this would not second for the properties connectedness and connectedness are and one requires the existence paths geodesics the spacetime represent the motion particles and every spacetime paracompact this allied with the smoothness the gives rise smooth linear connection important structure general some important theorems constructing spacetimes from compact and compact manifolds include the compact manifold can turned into spacetime and only its euler characteristic proof the existence lorentzian metric shown equivalent the existence nonvanishing vector any compact manifold can turned into spacetime symmetries spacetime symmetries often spacetimes that have some form symmetry are well helping classify these symmetries usually serve simplifying assumption specialized some the most popular ones axisymmetric spacetimes spherically symmetric spacetimes static spacetimes stationary spacetimes causal structure causal structure causality causality the causal

spacetime special relativity described the minkowski metric this spacetime called minkowski the minkowski metric usually denoted and can written four where the landau lifshitz like convention being basic assumption relativity that coordinate transformations must leave spacetime intervals intervals are invariant under lorentz transformations this invariance property leads the use four vectors and other describing strictly one can also consider events newtonian physics single this galilean newtonian relativity and the coordinate systems are related galilean transformations however since these preserve spatial and temporal distances such spacetime can decomposed into spatial coordinates plus temporal which not possible the general spacetime general relativity spacetime general relativity

the riemann tensor identically and this concept sometimes expressed the statement minkowski spacetime the earlier discussed notions light like and like intervals special relativity can similarly used classify dimensional curves through curved like curve can understood one where the interval between any two infinitesimally close events the curve and likewise for like and like technically the three types curves are usually defined terms whether the tangent vector each point the curve light like the world line light object will always like the world line massless particle such photon will like and like curve could the world line hypothetical tachyon the local neighborhood any time like curves that pass through the event will remain inside that past and future light cones light like curves that pass through the event will the surface the light and like curves that pass through the event will outside the light one can also define the notion dimensional spacelike continuous dimensional slice through the dimensional property with the property that every curve that contained entirely within this hypersurface like many spacetime continua have physical interpretations which most physicists would consider bizarre for compact spacetime has closed timelike curves which violate our usual ideas causality that future events could affect past for this mathematical physicists usually consider only restricted subsets all the possible one way this study realistic solutions the equations general another way add some additional physically but still fairly general geometric restrictions and try prove interesting things about the resulting the latter approach has led some important most notably the penrose hawking singularity theorems quantized spacetime quantum spacetime general spacetime assumed smooth and and not just the mathematical the theory quantum mechanics there inherent discreteness present attempting reconcile these two sometimes postulated that spacetime should quantized the very smallest current theory focused the nature spacetime the planck scale causal sets loop quantum gravity string theory and black hole thermodynamics all predict quantized spacetime with agreement the order loop quantum gravity makes precise predictions about the geometry spacetime the planck privileged character spacetime there are two kinds spatial and temporal let the number spatial dimensions and the number temporal dimensions that and setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked string theory and undetectable can explained appealing the physical consequences letting differ from and differ from the argument often anthropic character the implicit notion that the dimensionality the universe special first attributed gottfried wilhelm leibniz who the discourse metaphysics suggested that the world the one which the same time the simplest hypothesis and the richest immanuel kant argued that dimensional space was consequence the inverse square law universal gravitation while argument historically john barrow says that gets the line back the dimensionality space that explains why see square force laws not barrow this because the law gravitation any other inverse square law follows from the concept flux and the proportional relationship flux density and the strength then dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional the square their size any selected spatial sphere radius has area more space dimensions the strength the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated distance would inversely proportional paul ehrenfest showed that fix and let the orbit planet about its sun cannot remain the same true orbit around the center its galaxy ehrenfest also showed that then the different parts wave impulse will travel different and then wave impulses become only when are both problems hermann weyl showed that maxwell theory electromagnetism works only when and writing that this fact not only leads deeper understanding but also the fact that the world four which has hitherto always been accepted merely become intelligible through finally tangherlini showed that when electron orbitals around nuclei cannot electrons would either fall into the nucleus max tegmark expands the preceding argument the following anthropic manner differs from the behavior physical systems could not predicted reliably from knowledge the relevant partial differential equations such intelligent life capable manipulating technology could not moreover tegmark maintains that protons and electrons would unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than this not problem the particles have sufficiently low ehrenfest argument above atoms know them and probably more complex structures could not gravitation any kind becomes and the universe probably too simple contain for when nerves cannot cross without not clear how physical law could function differed from subatomic particles which decay after fixed period would not behave because like geodesics would not necessarily and has the peculiar property that the speed light vacuum lower bound the velocity all matter consists tachyons however signature and are physically call vectors with positive minkowski length timelike just convention that depends the convention for the sign the metric tensor indeed particle physicists tend use metric with signature that results positive minkowski length for timelike intervals and energies while spatial separations have negative minkowski length relativists however tend use the opposite convention that spatial separations have positive minkowski hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except and and different which happens describe the world about for elementary treatment the privileged status and see fig for deeper see barrow and tipler and barrow has repeatedly cited the work whitrow string theory hypothesizes that matter and energy are composed vibrating strings various most which are embedded dimensions that exist only scale larger than the planck length hence and not characterize string which embeds vibrating strings coordinate grids having even dimensions the causal dynamical triangulation theory background independent theory which derives the observed spacetime from minimal set and needs adjusting does not assume any existing arena dimensional but rather attempts show how the spacetime fabric itself shows spacetime dimensional near the planck scale and reveals fractal structure slices constant but spacetime becomes scales significantly larger than cdt
