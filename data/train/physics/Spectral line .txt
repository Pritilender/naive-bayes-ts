atomic nuclei and single photon when photon has about the right amount energy allow change the energy state the system the case atom this usually electron changing orbitals the photon then will spontaneously either the same frequency the original where the sum the energies the photons emitted will equal the energy the one absorbed assuming the system returns its original depending the type the photon source and what reaches the detector the either emission line absorption line will dark lines broad spectrum are produced when cold gas between broad spectrum photon source and the this case decrease the intensity light the frequency the incident photon seen the photons are then reemitted random which are mostly directions different from the original this results absorption line since the narrow frequency band light initially traveling toward the has been effectively scattered other absorption lines are produced even during reflection from illuminated cold after reflection there still the opportunity for selective absorption and between the point reflection and the this case the cold gas need not directly interposed between light source and the but required not act significant independent source the detector sees photons emitted directly from glowing then the detector often sees photons emitted narrow frequency range quantum emission processes atoms the and this results emission spectral lines are highly and can used identify the chemical composition any medium capable letting light pass through typically gas several elements were discovered spectroscopic such helium thallium and cerium spectral lines also depend the physical conditions the they are widely used determine the chemical composition stars and other celestial bodies that cannot analyzed other well their physical mechanisms other than photon interaction can produce spectral depending the exact physical interaction with single etc the frequency the involved photons will vary and lines can observed across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves gamma rays nomenclature this section requires expansion october strong spectral lines the visible part the spectrum often have unique fraunhofer line designation such for line emerging from singly ionized though some the fraunhofer lines are blends multiple lines from several different species other cases the lines are designated according the level ionization adding roman numeral the designation the chemical element that also has the designation neutral atoms are denoted with the roman number singly ionized atoms with and that for example roman represents eight times ionized iron more detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include multiplet number for atomic band designation for molecular many spectral lines atomic hydrogen also have designations within their respective series such the lyman series balmer series line broadening and shift spectral line extends over range not single frequency has nonzero linewidth its center may shifted from its nominal central there are several reasons for this broadening and these reasons may divided into two broad categories broadening due local conditions and broadening due extended broadening due local conditions due effects which hold small region around the emitting usually small enough assure local thermodynamic equilibrium broadening due extended conditions may result from changes the spectral distribution the radiation traverses its path the also may result from the combining radiation from number regions which are far from each broadening due local effects natural broadening the uncertainty principle relates the lifetime excited state due the spontaneous radiative decay the auger process with the uncertainty its short lifetime will have large energy uncertainty and broad this broadening effect results unshifted lorentzian profile the natural broadening can experimentally altered only the extent that decay rates can artificially suppressed thermal doppler broadening doppler broadening the atoms gas which are emitting radiation will have distribution each photon emitted will red blue shifted the doppler effect depending the velocity the atom relative the the higher the temperature the the wider the distribution velocities the since the spectral line combination all the emitted the higher the temperature the the broader will the spectral line emitted from that this broadening effect described gaussian profile and there associated pressure broadening the presence nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted individual there are two limiting cases which this impact pressure broadening collisional broadening the collision other particles with the emitting particle interrupts the emission and shortening the characteristic time for the increases the uncertainty the energy emitted occurs natural the duration the collision much shorter than the lifetime the emission this effect depends both the density and the temperature the the broadening effect described lorentzian profile and there may associated quasistatic pressure broadening the presence other particles shifts the energy levels the emitting thereby altering the frequency the emitted the duration the influence much longer than the lifetime the emission this effect depends the density the but rather insensitive temperature the form the line profile determined the functional form the perturbing force with respect distance from the perturbing there may also shift the line stable distribution general expression for the lineshape resulting from quasistatic pressure broadening pressure broadening may also classified the nature the perturbing force linear stark broadening occurs via the linear stark effect which results from the interaction emitter with electric which causes shift energy which linear the field resonance broadening occurs when the perturbing particle the same type the emitting which introduces the possibility energy exchange quadratic stark broadening occurs via the quadratic stark effect which results from the interaction emitter with electric which causes shift energy which quadratic the field van der waals broadening occurs when the emitting particle being perturbed van der waals forces for the quasistatic van der waals profile note often useful describing the the energy shift function distance given the wings the lennard jones potential inhomogeneous broadening inhomogeneous broadening general term for broadening because some emitting particles are different local environment than and therefore emit different this term used especially for where grain and stoichiometry variations can create variety local environments for given atom the effects inhomogeneous broadening sometimes reduced process called motional narrowing broadening due local effects certain types broadening are the result conditions over large region space rather than simply upon conditions that are local the emitting opacity broadening electromagnetic radiation emitted particular point space can absorbed travels through this absorption depends the line broadened because photons the line wings have smaller reabsorption probability than photons the line indeed the absorption near line center may great cause self reversal which the intensity the center the line less than the this process also sometimes called self absorption macroscopic doppler broadening radiation emitted moving source subject doppler shift due finite sight velocity different parts the emitting body have different velocities along the line the resulting line will with the line width proportional the width the velocity for radiation emitted from distant rotating such star will broadened due the sight variations velocity opposite sides the the greater the rate the broader the another example imploding plasma shell pinch combined effects each these mechanisms can act isolation combination with assuming each effect the observed line profile convolution the line profiles each for combination the thermal doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields voigt profile however the different line broadening mechanisms are not always for the collisional effects and the motional doppler shifts can act coherent resulting under some conditions even collisional narrowing known
