because multiplication division does not affect the fundamental role physics introduction special relativity special relativity way speed light the speed which light waves propagate vacuum independent both the motion the wave source and the inertial frame reference the note this invariance the speed light was postulated einstein after being motivated maxwell theory electromagnetism and the lack evidence for the luminiferous aether has since been consistently confirmed many only possible verify experimentally that the way speed light for from source mirror and back because impossible measure the one way speed light for from source distant without some convention how clocks the source and the detector should however adopting einstein synchronization for the the way speed light becomes equal the way speed light the special theory relativity explores the consequences this invariance with the assumption that the laws physics are the same all inertial frames one consequence that the speed which all massless particles and including must travel special relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified these include the equivalence mass and energy length contraction moving objects note and time dilation moving clocks run more the which lengths contract and times dilate known the lorentz factor and given where the speed the the difference from negligible for speeds much slower such most everyday which case special relativity closely approximated galilean relativity but increases relativistic speeds and diverges infinity approaches the results special relativity can summarized treating space and time unified structure known spacetime relating the units space and and requiring that physical theories satisfy special symmetry called lorentz invariance whose mathematical formulation contains the lorentz invariance almost universal assumption for modern physical such quantum electrodynamics quantum chromodynamics the standard model particle physics and general relativity the ubiquitous modern appearing many contexts that are unrelated for general relativity predicts also the speed gravity and gravitational waves non inertial frames reference gravitationally curved space accelerated reference frames the local speed light constant and equal but the speed light along trajectory finite length can differ depending how distances and times are generally assumed that fundamental constants such have the same value throughout meaning that they not depend location and not vary with however has been suggested various theories that the speed light may have changed over time conclusive evidence for such changes has been but they remain the subject ongoing also generally assumed that the speed light isotropic meaning that has the same value regardless the direction which observations the emissions from nuclear energy levels function the orientation the emitting nuclei magnetic field see hughes drever experiment and rotating optical resonators see resonator experiments have put stringent limits the possible way upper limit speeds according special the energy object with rest mass and speed given where the lorentz factor defined when equal giving rise the famous formula for mass energy equivalence the factor approaches infinity approaches and would take infinite amount energy accelerate object with mass the speed the speed light the upper limit for the speeds objects with positive rest this experimentally established many tests relativistic energy and momentum more normally impossible for information energy travel faster one argument for this follows from the intuitive implication special relativity known the relativity simultaneity the spatial distance between two greater than the time interval between them multiplied then there are frames reference others and others which they are something were travelling faster relative inertial frame would travelling backwards time relative another and causality would note such frame effect could observed before its cause such violation causality has never been and would lead paradoxes such the tachyonic antitelephone faster light observations and experiments light superluminal motion there are situations which may seem that energy information travels speeds greater but they for discussed the propagation light medium section many wave velocities can exceed for the phase velocity rays through most glasses can routinely exceed but phase velocity does not determine the velocity which waves convey laser beam swept quickly across distant the spot light can move faster although the initial movement the spot delayed because the time takes light get the distant object the however the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted which travels the from the laser the various positions the similarly shadow projected onto distant object can made move faster after delay neither case does any energy information travel faster than the rate change the distance between two objects frame reference with respect which both are moving their closing speed may have value excess however this does not represent the speed any single object measured single inertial certain quantum effects appear transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than the epr paradox example involves the quantum states two particles that can entangled until either the particles they exist superposition two quantum the particles are separated and one quantum state the other quantum state determined instantaneously faster than light could travel from one particle the however impossible control which quantum state the first particle will take when information cannot transmitted this another quantum effect that predicts the occurrence light speeds called the hartman effect under certain conditions the time needed for virtual particle tunnel through barrier regardless the thickness the this could result virtual particle crossing large gap however information can sent using this called superluminal motion seen certain astronomical such the relativistic jets radio galaxies and quasars however these jets are not moving speeds excess the speed the apparent superluminal motion projection effect caused objects moving near the speed light and approaching earth small angle the line since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer reach the the time between two successive observations corresponds longer time between the instants which the light rays were models the expanding the farther galaxies are from each the faster they drift this receding not due motion through space but rather the expansion space itself for galaxies far away from earth appear moving away from the earth with speed proportional their beyond boundary called the hubble sphere the rate which their distance from earth increases becomes greater than the speed propagation light classical physics light described type electromagnetic wave the classical behaviour the electromagnetic field described maxwell equations which predict that the with which electromagnetic waves such propagate through the vacuum related the electric constant and the magnetic constant the equation modern quantum physics the electromagnetic field described the theory quantum electrodynamics this light described the fundamental excitations the electromagnetic called photons photons are massless particles and according special they travel the speed light extensions qed which the photon has mass have been such its speed would depend its and the invariant special relativity would then the upper limit the speed light variation the speed light with frequency has been observed rigorous putting stringent limits the mass the the limit obtained depends the model the massive photon described proca theory the experimental upper bound for its mass about grams photon mass generated higgs mechanism the experimental upper limit less roughly another reason for the speed light vary with its frequency would the failure special relativity apply arbitrarily small predicted some proposed theories quantum gravity the observation the spectrum gamma ray burst grb did not find any difference the speeds photons different confirming that lorentz invariance verified least down the scale the planck length divided medium refractive index light usually does not propagate speed equal further different types light wave will travel different the speed which the individual crests and troughs plane wave wave filling the whole with only one frequency propagate called the phase velocity actual physical signal with finite extent pulse travels different the largest part the pulse travels the group velocity and its earliest part travels the front velocity the phase velocity important determining how light wave travels through material from one material often represented terms refractive index the refractive index material defined the ratio the phase the larger indices refraction indicate lower the refractive index material may depend the intensity polarization direction many though can treated dependent the refractive index air approximately denser such water glass and diamond have refractive indexes around and respectively for visible exotic materials like bose einstein condensates near absolute the effective speed light may only few metres per however this represents absorption and radiation delay between all speeds material extreme example light slowing two independent teams physicists claimed bring light complete passing through einstein condensate the element rubidium one team harvard university and the rowland institute for science mass and the other the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics also however the popular description light being stopped these experiments refers only light being stored the excited states then emitted arbitrarily later stimulated second laser during the time had had ceased this type behaviour generally microscopically true all transparent media which slow the speed transparent the refractive index generally greater than meaning that the phase velocity less than other possible for the refractive index become smaller than for some some exotic materials even possible for the index refraction become the requirement that causality not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts the dielectric constant any corresponding respectively the index refraction and the attenuation coefficient are linked the kramers kronig relations practical this means that material with refractive index less than the absorption the wave quick that signal can sent faster than pulse with different group and phase velocities which occurs the phase velocity not the same for all the frequencies the smears out over process known dispersion certain materials have exceptionally low even group velocity for light phenomenon called slow light which has been confirmed various the group velocities exceeding has also been shown should even possible for the group velocity become infinite with pulses travelling instantaneously backwards none these however allow information transmitted faster than impossible transmit information with light pulse any faster than the speed the earliest part the pulse the front velocity can shown that this under certain always equal possible for particle travel through medium faster than the phase velocity light that medium but still slower than when charged particle does that dielectric material the electromagnetic equivalent shock wave known cherenkov radiation practical effects finiteness the speed light relevance communications the way and round trip delay time are greater than this applies from small astronomical the other some techniques depend the finite speed for example distance small scales supercomputers the speed light imposes limit how quickly data can sent between processors processor operates gigahertz signal can only travel maximum about centimetres single processors must therefore placed close each other minimize communication this can cause difficulty with clock frequencies continue the speed light will eventually become limiting factor for the internal design single chips large distances earth for given the equatorial circumference the earth about and about the theoretical shortest time for piece information travel half the globe along the surface about milliseconds when light travelling around the globe optical fibre the actual transit time part because the speed light slower about optical depending its refractive index furthermore straight lines rarely occur global communications and delays are created when the signal passes through electronic switch signal spaceflights and astronomy communications between the earth and spacecraft are not there brief delay from the source the which becomes more noticeable distances this delay was significant for communications between ground control and apollo when became the first manned spacecraft orbit the for every the ground control station had wait least seconds for the answer the communications delay between earth and mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions the two consequence robot the surface mars were encounter its human controllers would not aware until least five minutes and possibly twenty minutes would then take further five twenty minutes for instructions travel from earth nasa must wait several hours for information from probe orbiting and needs correct navigation the fix will not arrive the spacecraft for equal amount creating risk the correction not arriving receiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much for has taken billion years for light travel earth from the faraway galaxies viewed the hubble ultra deep field images those taken capture images the galaxies they appeared billion years when the universe was less than billion years the fact that more distant objects appear due the finite speed allows astronomers infer the evolution stars galaxies and the universe itself astronomical distances are sometimes expressed light years especially popular science publications and year the distance light travels one around billion billion parsecs round light year nearly trillion kilometres nearly trillion proxima centauri the closest star earth after the around light years distance measurement distance measurement radar systems measure the distance target the time takes wave pulse return the radar antenna after being reflected the the distance the target half the trip transit time multiplied the speed global positioning system receiver measures its distance gps satellites based how long takes for radio signal arrive from each and from these distances calculates the because light travels about kilometres miles one these measurements small fractions second must very the lunar laser ranging experiment radar astronomy and the deep space network determine distances the planets and respectively measuring trip transit high frequency trading the speed light has become important high frequency trading where traders seek gain minute advantages delivering their trades exchanges fractions second ahead other for example traders have been switching microwave communications between trading because the advantage which microwaves travelling near the speed light have over fibre optic signals which travel slower the speed light through measurement there are different ways determine the value one way measure the actual speed which light waves which can done various astronomical and based however also possible determine from other physical laws where for determining the values the electromagnetic constants and and using their relation historically the most accurate results have been obtained separately determining the frequency and wavelength light with their product equalling the metre was defined the length the path travelled light vacuum during time interval fixing the value the speed light described below consequently accurate measurements the speed light yield accurate realization the metre rather than accurate value astronomical measurements outer space natural setting for measuring the speed light because its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum typically one measures the time needed for light traverse some reference distance the solar system such the radius the historically such measurements could made fairly compared how accurately the length the reference distance known based customary express the results astronomical units per astronomical unit approximately the average distance between the earth and not based the international system units note because the determines actual and not based upon flight like the modern measurements the speed light astronomical units per day can compared with the defined value the international system ole christensen mer used astronomical measurement make the first quantitative estimate the speed light when measured from the periods moons orbiting distant planet are shorter when the earth closer the planet than when the earth farther away from the distance travelled light from the planet its earth shorter when the earth the point its orbit that closest its planet than when the earth the farthest point its the difference distance being the diameter the orbit around the the observed change the orbital period actually the difference the time takes light traverse the shorter longer mer observed this effect for jupiter innermost moon and deduced that light takes minutes cross the diameter the another method use the aberration light discovered and explained james bradley the this effect results from the vector addition the velocity light arriving from distant source such and the velocity its observer see diagram the moving observer thus sees the light coming from slightly different direction and consequently sees the source position shifted from its original since the direction the velocity changes continuously the earth orbits the this effect causes the apparent position stars move from the angular difference the position stars maximally arcseconds possible express the speed light terms the velocity around the which with the known length year can converted the time needed travel from the sun the bradley used this method derive that light travelled times faster than the earth its orbit the modern figure times equivalently that would take light minutes seconds travel from the sun the nowadays the light time for unit the inverse expressed seconds per astronomical measured comparing the time for radio signals reach different spacecraft the solar with their position calculated from the gravitational effects the sun and various combining many such best fit value for the light time per unit distance the best approved the international astronomical union the relative uncertainty these measurements parts per billion equivalent the uncertainty based measurements length note since the metre defined the length travelled light certain time the measurement the light time for unit distance can also interpreted measuring the length note time flight techniques method measuring the speed light measure the time needed for light travel mirror known distance and this the working principle behind the fizeau foucault apparatus developed hippolyte fizeau and foucault fizeau apparatus the setup used fizeau consists beam light directed mirror kilometres away the way from the source the the beam passes through rotating certain rate the beam passes through one gap the way out and another the way but slightly higher lower the beam strikes tooth and does not pass through the knowing the distance between the wheel and the the number teeth the and the rate the speed light can the method foucault replaces the cogwheel rotating because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels the distant mirror and the light reflected from the rotating mirror different angle its way out than its way from this difference the known speed rotation and the distance the distant mirror the speed light may nowadays using oscilloscopes with time resolutions less than one the speed light can directly measured timing the delay light pulse from laser led reflected from this method less precise with errors the order than other modern but sometimes used laboratory experiment college physics electromagnetic constants option for deriving that does not directly depend measurement the propagation electromagnetic waves use the relation between and the vacuum permittivity and vacuum permeability established the vacuum permittivity may determined measuring the capacitance and dimensions capacitor whereas the value the vacuum permeability fixed exactly through the definition the ampere rosa and dorsey used this method find value cavity resonance standing waves another way measure the speed light independently measure the frequency and wavelength electromagnetic wave the value can then found using the relation one option measure the resonance frequency cavity resonator the dimensions the resonance cavity are also these can used determine the wavelength the louis essen and gordon smith established the frequency for variety normal modes microwaves microwave cavity precisely known the dimensions were established accuracy about using gauges calibrated the wavelength the modes was known from the geometry the cavity and from electromagnetic theory knowledge the associated frequencies enabled calculation the speed the smith was substantially more precise than those found optical repeated measurements essen established result household demonstration this technique using microwave oven and food such marshmallows the turntable removed that the food does not will cook the fastest the antinodes the points which the wave amplitude the where will begin the distance between two such spots half the wavelength the measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength the microwave frequency usually displayed the back the typically the value can often with less than error interferometry constructive interference destructive interference interferometry another method find the wavelength electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed coherent beam light from laser with known frequency split follow two paths and then adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change path the wavelength the light can the speed light then calculated using the before the advent laser coherent radio sources were used for interferometry measurements the speed however interferometric determination wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited precision the long wavelength the the precision can improved using light with shorter but then becomes difficult directly measure the frequency the one way around this problem start with low frequency signal which the frequency can precisely and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then linked the original laser can then locked the and its wavelength can determined using this technique was due group the national bureau standards which later became nist they used measure the speed light vacuum with fractional uncertainty history mer huygens james bradley hippolyte fizeau foucault albert michelson essen and smith until the early modern period was not known whether light travelled instantaneously very fast finite the first extant recorded examination this subject was ancient greece the ancient muslim scholars and classical european scientists long debated this until mer provided the first calculation the speed einstein theory special relativity concluded that the speed light constant regardless frame since scientists have provided increasingly accurate early history empedocles was the first claim that light has finite maintained that light was something and therefore must take some time aristotle argued the that light due the presence but not euclid and ptolemy advanced emission theory where light emitted from the thus enabling based that heron alexandria argued that the speed light must infinite because distant objects such stars appear immediately upon opening the early islamic philosophers initially agreed with the aristotelian view that light had speed alhazen ibn published the book optics which presented series arguments dismissing the emission theory favour the now accepted intromission theory vision which light moves from object into the this led alhazen propose that light must have finite and that the speed light decreasing denser argued that light substantial the propagation which requires even this hidden from our also the rayh agreed that light has finite and observed that the speed light much faster than the speed the roger bacon argued that the speed light air was not using philosophical arguments backed the writing alhazen and the witelo considered the possibility light travelling infinite speed but slowing down denser the early johannes kepler believed that the speed light was since empty space presents obstacle ren descartes argued that the speed light were the earth and moon would noticeably out alignment during lunar eclipse since such misalignment had not been descartes concluded the speed light was descartes speculated that the speed light were found his whole system philosophy might derivation snell law assumed that even though the speed light was the more dense the the faster was pierre fermat derived law using the opposing the more dense the medium the slower light fermat also argued support finite speed first measurement attempts isaac beeckman proposed experiment which person observes the flash cannon reflecting off mirror about one mile away galileo galilei proposed with apparent claim having performed some years measure the speed light observing the delay between uncovering lantern and its perception some distance was unable distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous but concluded that were must nevertheless extraordinarily galileo experiment was carried out the accademia del cimento italy with the lanterns separated about but delay was the actual delay this experiment would have been about microseconds the first quantitative estimate the speed light was made mer see determination the speed light from the observation that the periods innermost moon appeared shorter when the earth was approaching jupiter than when receding from concluded that light travels finite and estimated that takes light minutes cross the diameter christiaan huygens combined this estimate with estimate for the diameter the orbit obtain estimate speed light lower than the actual his book opticks isaac newton reported calculations the finite speed light and gave value seven eight for the time taken for light travel from the sun the earth the modern value minutes newton queried whether eclipse shadows were hearing that they were concluded the different colours travelled the same james bradley discovered the aberration light from this effect determined that light must travel times faster than the earth its orbit the modern figure times equivalently that would take light minutes seconds travel from the sun the connections with electromagnetism history electromagnetic theory history special relativity the century hippolyte fizeau developed method determine the speed light based flight measurements earth and reported value his method was improved upon foucault who obtained value the year wilhelm eduard weber and rudolf kohlrausch measured the ratio the electromagnetic and electrostatic units discharging leyden jar and found that its numerical value was very close the speed light measured directly the following year gustav kirchhoff calculated that electric signal resistanceless wire travels along the wire this the early maxwell showed according the theory electromagnetism was working electromagnetic waves propagate empty space speed equal the above kohrausch and drawing attention the numerical proximity this value the speed light measured proposed that light fact electromagnetic luminiferous was thought the time that empty space was filled with background medium called the luminiferous aether which the electromagnetic field some physicists thought that this aether acted preferred frame reference for the propagation light and therefore should possible measure the motion the earth with respect this measuring the isotropy the speed beginning the several experiments were performed try detect this the most famous which the experiment performed albert michelson and edward morley the detected motion was always less than the observational modern experiments indicate that the way speed light isotropic the same every within nanometres per because this experiment hendrik lorentz proposed that the motion the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus contract along its length the direction and further that the time variable for moving systems must also changed accordingly local which led the formulation the lorentz transformation based lorentz aether theory henri showed that this local time first order indicated clocks moving the which are synchronized under the assumption constant light speculated that the speed light could limiting velocity provided that the assumptions theory are all poincar brought aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle relativity special relativity einstein postulated from the outset that the speed light measured accelerating independent the motion the source using this and the principle relativity basis derived the special theory relativity which the speed light vacuum featured fundamental also appearing contexts unrelated this made the concept the stationary aether which lorentz and still useless and revolutionized the concepts space and increased accuracy and redefinition the metre and second history the metre the second half the century much progress was made increasing the accuracy measurements the speed first cavity resonance techniques and later laser interferometer these were aided more definitions the metre and the metre was redefined terms the wavelength particular spectral line and the second was redefined terms the hyperfine transition frequency the ground state caesium using the laser interferometer method and the new group nbs boulder colorado determined the speed light vacuum this was times less uncertain than the previously accepted the remaining uncertainty was mainly related the definition the note similar experiments found comparable results for the conf rence rale des poids mesures recommended using the value for the speed defining the speed light explicit constant the cgpm found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and given value for the speed light are more reproducible than the previous they kept the standard for the caesium hyperfine frequency would now determine both the second and the they redefined the metre the metre the length the path travelled light vacuum during time interval result this the value the speed light vacuum exactly and has become defined constant the system improved experimental techniques that prior would have measured the speed longer affect the value the speed light but instead allow more precise realization the metre more accurately measuring the wavelength and other light the cgpm said intends define all seven base units using what calls the constant where each unit defined indirectly specifying explicitly exact value for recognized fundamental was done for the speed proposed but completely wording the the symbol the unit its magnitude set fixing the numerical value the speed light vacuum equal exactly when expressed the unit see also second notes the speed light imperial units and units based inch exactly and exactly miles yards feet and inches per however the frequency light can depend the motion the source relative the due the doppler effect whereas moving objects are measured shorter along the line relative they are also seen being this known terrell rotation due the different times that light from different parts the object takes reach the thought that the scharnhorst effect does allow signals travel slightly faster but the special conditions which this effect can occur prevent one from using this effect violate the astronomical unit defined the radius unperturbed circular newtonian orbit about the sun particle having infinitesimal moving with angular frequency radians approximately per may noted that the astronomical unit increases rate about probably due the changing mass the this unit has the advantage that the gravitational constant multiplied the mass has exact value cubic astronomical units per day the value the speed light astronomical units has measurement unlike the value because the different definitions the unit nevertheless this degree the effects general relativity must taken into consideration when interpreting the the metre considered unit proper length whereas the usually used unit observed length given frame the values cited here follow the latter and are tdb between and the metre was defined the metre the length equal wavelengths vacuum the radiation corresponding the transition between the levels and the krypton atom was discovered the that this spectral line was not which put limit the precision with which the definition could realized interferometry
