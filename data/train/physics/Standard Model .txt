brout hagen guralnik kibble ting richter the standard model particle physics theory concerning the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear which mediate the dynamics the known subatomic particles was developed throughout the latter half the collaborative effort scientists around the the current formulation was finalized the upon experimental confirmation the existence quarks since discoveries the top quark the tau neutrino and more recently the higgs boson have given further credence the standard because its success explaining wide variety experimental the standard model sometimes regarded theory almost the standard model falls short being complete theory fundamental interactions does not incorporate the full theory gravitation described general relativity account for the accelerating expansion the universe possibly described dark energy the model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all the required properties deduced from observational cosmology also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their zero although the standard model believed theoretically consistent and has demonstrated huge and continued successes providing experimental does leave some phenomena unexplained the development the standard model was driven theoretical and experimental particle physicists for the standard model paradigm quantum field theory which exhibits wide

electromagnetic and weak interactions steven weinberg and abdus salam incorporated the higgs mechanism into electroweak theory giving its modern the higgs mechanism believed give rise the masses all the elementary particles the standard this includes the masses the and bosons and the masses the fermions the quarks and leptons after the neutral weak currents caused boson exchange were discovered cern the electroweak theory became widely accepted and salam and weinberg shared the nobel prize physics for discovering the and bosons were discovered experimentally and their masses were found the standard model the theory the strong interaction which many acquired its modern form around when experiments confirmed that the hadrons were composed fractionally charged overview matter and energy are best understood terms the kinematics and interactions elementary physics has reduced the laws governing the behavior and interaction all known forms matter and energy small set fundamental laws and major goal physics find the common that would unite all these theories into one integrated theory everything which all the other known laws would special and from which the behavior all matter and energy could derived least particle content the standard model includes members several classes elementary particles gauge and the higgs which turn can distinguished other such color fermions weak isospin weak hypercharge color charge weak mixing angle higgs field electroweak symmetry the standard model includes elementary particles spin known fermions according the spin statistics theorem fermions respect the pauli exclusion principle each fermion has corresponding antiparticle the fermions the standard model are classified according how they interact what charges they there are six quarks down charm strange top bottom and six leptons electron electron neutrino muon muon neutrino tau tau neutrino pairs from each classification are grouped together form generation with corresponding particles exhibiting similar physical behavior see the defining property the quarks that they carry color charge and interact via the strong interaction phenomenon called color confinement results quarks being perpetually least since very soon after the start the big bang bound one forming neutral composite particles hadrons containing either quark and antiquark mesons three quarks baryons the familiar proton and the neutron are the two baryons having the smallest quarks also carry electric charge and weak isospin hence they interact with other fermions both electromagnetically and via the weak interaction the remaining six fermions not carry colour charge and are called the three neutrinos not carry electric charge their motion directly influenced only the weak nuclear force which makes them notoriously difficult however virtue carrying electric the muon and tau all interact each member generation has greater mass than the corresponding particles lower the first generation charged particles not hence all ordinary matter made such specifically all atoms consist electrons orbiting atomic nuclei ultimately constituted and down second and third generations charged the other decay with very short half and are observed only very energy neutrinos all generations also not and pervade the but rarely interact with baryonic gauge bosons the standard gauge bosons are defined force carriers that mediate the weak and electromagnetic fundamental interactions interactions physics are the ways that particles influence other macroscopic level electromagnetism allows particles interact with one another via electric and magnetic fields and gravitation allows particles with mass attract one another accordance with theory general relativity the standard model explains such forces resulting from matter particles exchanging other particles known force mediating particles strictly this only interpreting literally what actually approximation method known perturbation theory citation needed when mediating particle macroscopic level the effect equivalent force influencing both and the particle therefore said have mediated been the agent that the feynman diagram calculations which are graphical representation the perturbation theory invoke force mediating and when applied analyze high energy scattering experiments are reasonable agreement with the however perturbation theory and with the concept mediating fails other these include energy quantum chromodynamics bound states and solitons the gauge bosons the standard model all have spin matter the value the spin making them bosons they not follow the pauli exclusion principle that constrains fermions thus bosons photons not have theoretical limit their spatial density number per the different types gauge bosons are described photons mediate the electromagnetic force between electrically charged the photon massless and described the theory quantum electrodynamics the and gauge bosons mediate the weak interactions between particles different flavors all quarks and they are with the being more massive than the the weak interactions involving the exclusively act left handed particles and right handed antiparticles furthermore the carries electric charge and and couples the electromagnetic the electrically neutral boson interacts with both handed particles and these three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped collectively mediating the electroweak interaction the eight gluons mediate the strong interactions between color charged particles the gluons are the eightfold multiplicity gluons labeled combination color and anticolor charge red because the gluons have effective color they can also interact among the gluons and their interactions are described the theory quantum chromodynamics the interactions between all the particles described the standard model are summarized the diagrams the right this higgs boson higgs boson the higgs

standard has intrinsic spin and for that reason classified boson like the gauge which have integer spin the higgs boson plays unique role the standard explaining why the other elementary except the photon and gluon are the higgs boson explains why the photon has while the and bosons are very elementary particle and the differences between electromagnetism mediated the and the weak force mediated the and are critical many aspects the structure microscopic and hence matter electroweak theory the higgs boson generates the masses the leptons muon and and the higgs boson must interact with because the higgs boson very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when only very energy particle accelerator can observe and record experiments confirm and determine the nature the higgs boson

classic standard model can modified include neutrino one insists using only standard model this can achieved adding renormalizable interaction leptons with the higgs fundamental such interaction emerges the seesaw mechanism where heavy handed neutrinos are added the this natural the left right symmetric extension the standard model and certain grand unified theories long new physics appears below around gev the neutrino masses can the right order theoretical and experimental research has attempted extend the standard model into unified field theory theory everything complete theory explaining all physical phenomena including inadequacies the standard model that motivate such research does not attempt explain gravitation although theoretical particle known graviton would help explain and unlike for the strong and electroweak interactions the standard there known way describing general relativity the canonical theory consistently terms quantum field theory the reason for this among other that quantum field theories gravity generally break down before reaching the planck scale have reliable theory for the very early some consider hoc and requiring numerical constants whose values are unrelated and although the standard now can explain why neutrinos have the specifics neutrino mass are still believed that explaining neutrino mass will require additional constants which are also arbitrary the higgs mechanism gives rise the hierarchy problem any new physics such quantum present high energy order for the weak scale much smaller than the planck scale severe fine tuning standard model parameters should modified consistent with the emerging standard model cosmology the standard model cannot explain the observed amount cold dark matter and gives contributions dark energy which are many orders magnitude too also difficult accommodate the observed predominance matter over antimatter matter antimatter asymmetry the isotropy and homogeneity the visible universe over large distances seems require mechanism like cosmic inflation which would also constitute extension the standard currently proposed theory everything has been widely accepted see also
