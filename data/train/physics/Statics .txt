concerned with the analysis loads force and torque moment physical systems static that state where the relative positions subsystems not vary over where components and structures are constant when static the system either its center mass moves constant newton first law this situation implies that the net force and net torque also known moment every part the system from this such quantities

vectors contain components orthogonal unit vectors and are along the and axes respectively force force the action one body force either push force tends move body the direction its the action force characterized its the direction its and its point thus force vector because its effect depends the direction well the magnitude the forces are classified either contact body contact force produced direct physical example the force exerted body supporting body force generated virtue the position body within force field such electric magnetic example body force the weight body the gravitational moment force addition the tendency move body the direction its force can also tend rotate body about the axis may any line which neither intersects nor parallel the line action the this rotational tendency known the moment the moment also referred torque moment about point the magnitude the moment force point equal the perpendicular distance from the line action multiplied the magnitude the where the force applied the perpendicular distance from the axis the line action the this perpendicular distance called the moment the direction the moment given the right hand where counter clockwise out the and clockwise into the the moment direction may accounted for using stated sign such plus sign for counterclockwise moments and minus sign for clockwise vice moments can added together vector the moment can defined the cross product between the radius the vector from point the line and the force varignon theorem varignon theorem states that the moment force about any point equal the sum the moments the components the force about the same equilibrium equations the static equilibrium particle important concept particle equilibrium only the resultant all forces acting the particle equal rectangular coordinate system the equilibrium equations can represented three scalar where the sums forces all three directions are equal engineering application this concept determining the tensions three cables under for example the forces exerted each cable hoist lifting object guy wires restraining hot air balloon the moment inertia classical moment inertia also called mass rotational polar moment inertia the angular units measure resistance changes its the inertia rotating body with respect its the moment inertia plays much the same role rotational dynamics mass does linear describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular torque and angular and several other the symbols and are usually used refer the moment inertia polar moment while simple scalar treatment the moment inertia suffices for many more advanced tensor treatment allows the analysis such complicated systems spinning tops and gyroscopic the concept was introduced leonhard euler his book theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum discussed the moment inertia and many related such the principal axis solids statics used the analysis for instance architectural and structural engineering strength materials related field mechanics that relies heavily the application static key concept the center gravity body represents imaginary point which all the mass body the position the point relative the foundations which body lies determines its stability response external the center gravity exists outside the then the body unstable because there torque any small disturbance will cause the body fall the center gravity exists within the the body stable since net torque acts the the center gravity coincides with the then the body said metastable fluids hydrostatics also known fluid statics the study fluids rest static the characteristic any fluid rest that the force exerted any particle the fluid the same all points the same depth within the the net force greater than zero the fluid will move the direction the resulting this concept was first formulated slightly extended form french mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal and became known pascal law has many important applications hydraulics archimedes rayh khazini and galileo galilei were also major figures the development see also physics portal dynamics mechanical equilibrium solid mechanics cremona diagram
