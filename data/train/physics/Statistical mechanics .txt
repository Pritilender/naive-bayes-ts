mathematical physics that using probability theory the average behaviour mechanical system where the state the system note the present understanding the universe indicates that its fundamental laws are mechanical and that all physical systems are therefore governed mechanical laws microscopic these laws are precise equations motion that map any given initial state corresponding future state later there however disconnection between these laws and everyday life not find necessary nor know exactly microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities each molecule while carrying out processes the human scale for when performing chemical statistical mechanics collection mathematical tools that are used fill this disconnection between the laws mechanics and the practical experience incomplete common use statistical mechanics explaining the thermodynamic behaviour large microscopic mechanical laws not contain concepts such heat however statistical mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty that arises about the state system when that system prepared the benefit using statistical mechanics that provides exact methods connect thermodynamic quantities such heat capacity microscopic whereas classical thermodynamics the only available option would just measure and tabulate such quantities for various statistical mechanics also makes possible extend the laws thermodynamics cases which are not considered classical for example microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees this branch statistical mechanics which treats and extends classical thermodynamics known statistical thermodynamics equilibrium statistical mechanics statistical mechanics also finds use outside important subbranch known non equilibrium statistical mechanics deals with the issue microscopically modelling the speed irreversible processes that are driven examples such processes include chemical flows particles and unlike with there

statistical mechanics stochastic methods near equilibrium methods hybrid methods applications outside thermodynamics history see also notes references external links mechanics and ensembles mechanics statistical ensemble physics there are two types mechanics usually classical mechanics and quantum mechanics for both types the standard mathematical approach consider two the complete state the mechanical system given mathematically encoded phase point classical pure quantum state vector quantum equation motion which carries the state forward hamilton equations classical the time dependent dinger equation quantum using these two the state any other past can principle whereas ordinary mechanics only considers the behaviour single statistical mechanics introduces the statistical ensemble which large collection independent copies the system various the statistical ensemble probability distribution over all possible states the classical statistical the ensemble probability distribution over phase points opposed single phase point ordinary usually represented distribution phase space with canonical coordinates quantum statistical the ensemble probability distribution over pure note and can compactly summarized density matrix usual for the ensemble can interpreted different ensemble can taken represent the various possible states that single system could epistemic probability form the members the ensemble can understood the states the systems experiments repeated independent systems which have been prepared similar but imperfectly controlled manner empirical probability the limit infinite number these two meanings are equivalent for many and will used interchangeably this however the probability each state the ensemble evolves over time according the equation thus the ensemble itself the probability distribution over also the virtual systems the ensemble continually leave one state and enter the ensemble evolution given the liouville equation classical the von neumann equation quantum these equations are simply derived the application the mechanical equation motion separately each virtual system contained the with the probability the virtual system being conserved over time evolves from state one special class ensemble those ensembles that not evolve over these ensembles are known equilibrium ensembles and their condition known statistical equilibrium statistical equilibrium occurs for each state the the ensemble also contains all its future and past states with probabilities equal that note the study equilibrium ensembles isolated systems the focus statistical non equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case ensembles that change over and ensembles isolated statistical thermodynamics the primary goal statistical thermodynamics also known equilibrium statistical explain the classical thermodynamics materials terms the properties their constituent particles and the interactions between other statistical thermodynamics provides connection between the macroscopic properties materials thermodynamic equilibrium and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the one might ask what about thermodynamic system molecules that determines the free energy characteristic that classical thermodynamics does not provide the for were given spectroscopic this body gas such bond length bond angle bond rotation and flexibility the bonds should see that the free energy could not other than prove this need bridge the gap between the microscopic realm atoms and molecules and the macroscopic realm classical statistical mechanics demonstrates how the thermodynamic parameters such temperature and are related microscopic behaviours such constituent atoms and although may understand system general lack information about the state specific instance that for this reason the notion statistical ensemble probability distribution over possible furthermore order reflect that the material thermodynamic necessary introduce corresponding statistical mechanical definition the analogue thermodynamic equilibrium statistical thermodynamics the ensemble property statistical described the previous additional assumption statistical thermodynamics that the system isolated varying external forces are acting the that its total energy does not vary over sufficient but not condition for statistical equilibrium with isolated system that the probability distribution function only conserved properties total total particle etc fundamental postulate there are many different equilibrium ensembles that can and only some them correspond additional postulate necessary motivate why the ensemble for given system should have one form common approach found many textbooks take the equal priori probability postulate this postulate states that for isolated system with exactly known energy and exactly known the system can found with any microstate consistent with that the equal priori probability postulate therefore provides motivation for the microcanonical ensemble described there are various arguments favour the equal priori probability ergodic hypothesis ergodic state one that evolves over time explore all states all those with the same energy and ergodic the microcanonical ensemble the only possible equilibrium ensemble with fixed this approach has limited since most systems are not principle indifference the absence any further can only assign equal probabilities each compatible maximum information entropy more elaborate version the principle indifference states that the correct ensemble the ensemble that compatible with the known information and that has the largest gibbs entropy information entropy other fundamental postulates for statistical mechanics have also been any the reason for establishing the microcanonical ensemble mainly axiomatic the microcanonical ensemble itself mathematically awkward use for real and even very simple finite systems can only solved however possible use the microcanonical ensemble construct hypothetical infinite thermodynamic reservoir that has exactly defined notion temperature and chemical once this reservoir has been can used justify exactly the canonical ensemble grand canonical ensemble see for any other system considering the contact this system with the these other ensembles are those actually used practical statistical mechanics calculations they are mathematically simpler and also correspond much more realistic situation energy not known three thermodynamic ensembles microcanonical ensemble canonical ensemble grand canonical ensemble there are three equilibrium ensembles with simple form that can defined for any isolated system bounded inside finite these are the most often discussed ensembles statistical the macroscopic limit defined they all correspond classical the microcanonical ensemble describes system with precisely given energy and fixed composition precise number the microcanonical ensemble contains with equal probability each possible state that consistent with that energy and the canonical ensemble describes system fixed composition that thermal equilibrium note with heat bath precise temperature the canonical ensemble contains states varying energy but identical the different states the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending their total the grand canonical ensemble describes system with fixed composition uncertain particle that thermal and chemical equilibrium with thermodynamic reservoir the reservoir has precise and precise chemical potentials for various types the grand canonical ensemble contains states varying energy and varying numbers the different states the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending their total energy and total particle microcanonical canonical grand canonical microstates canonical partition function grand partition function boltzmann entropy helmholtz free energy grand potential statistical fluctuations and the macroscopic limit thermodynamic limit the thermodynamic most significant difference that they either admit uncertainty the variables energy particle that those variables are fixed particular while this difference can observed some for macroscopic systems the thermodynamic ensembles are usually observationally the limit large systems statistical mechanics known the thermodynamic limit the thermodynamic limit the canonical and grand canonical ensembles tend give identical predictions about thermodynamic this means that one can specify either total energy temperature and arrive the same likewise one can specify either total particle number chemical given these the best ensemble choose for the calculation the properties macroscopic system usually just the ensemble which allows the result derived most important cases where the thermodynamic ensembles not give identical results systems phase systems with range microscopic these cases the correct thermodynamic ensemble must chosen there are observable differences between these ensembles not just the size but also average quantities such the distribution the correct ensemble that which corresponds the way the system has been prepared and other the ensemble that reflects the knowledge about that illustrative example the above concepts can illustrated for the specific case one liter ammonia gas standard note that statistical thermodynamics not restricted the study macroscopic and the example gas given here illustrate statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics apply all mechanical systems including microscopic and all phases liquids solids plasmas gases nuclear matter quark matter simple way prepare one litre sample ammonia standard condition take very large reservoir ammonia those standard and connect previously evacuated litre after ammonia gas has entered the container and the container has been given time reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the the container then sealed and this repeatable process resulting very well defined sample gas with precise now consider the corresponding precise description statistical although this process well defined and repeatable macroscopic have information about the exact locations and velocities each and every molecule the container moreover not even know exactly how many molecules are the even supposing knew exactly the average density the ammonia gas not know how many molecules the gas happened inside our container the moment when sealed the sample equilibrium and equilibrium with the could reconnect the reservoir for some and then seal and our knowledge about the state the gas would not this our knowledge about the state the gas precisely described the grand canonical ensemble provided have accurate microscopic model the ammonia could principle compute all thermodynamic properties this sample gas using the distribution provided the grand canonical hypothetically could use extremely sensitive weight scale measure exactly the mass the container before and after introducing the ammonia that can exactly know the number ammonia after make this then our knowledge about the gas would correspond the canonical ensemble finally suppose some hypothetical apparatus can measure exactly the number molecules and also measure exactly the total energy the supposing furthermore that this apparatus gives further information about the positions and our knowledge about the system would correspond the microcanonical ensemble even after making such however our expectations about the behaviour the gas not change this because the gas sample macroscopic and approximates very well the thermodynamic limit the different ensembles behave this can demonstrated considering how small the actual fluctuations would suppose that knew the number density ammonia gas was exactly molecules per liter inside the reservoir ammonia gas used fill the litre describing the container with the grand canonical then the average number molecules would and the uncertainty standard deviation the number molecules would assuming poisson distribution which relatively very small compared the total number upon measuring the particle number thus arriving canonical should find very nearly molecules for example the probability finding more than less than molecules would about note calculation methods once the characteristic state function for ensemble has been calculated for given that system macroscopic observables can extracted from the characteristic state calculating the characteristic state function thermodynamic ensemble not necessarily simple however since involves considering every possible state the while some hypothetical systems have been exactly the most general and case too complex for exact various approaches exist approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation average exact there are some cases which allow exact for very small microscopic the ensembles can directly computed simply enumerating over all possible states the system using exact diagonalization quantum integral over all phase space classical some large systems consist many separable microscopic and each the subsystems can analysed notably idealized gases interacting particles have this allowing exact derivations maxwell boltzmann statistics fermi dirac statistics and bose einstein statistics few large systems with interaction have been the use subtle mathematical exact solutions have been found for few toy models some examples include the bethe ansatz square lattice ising model zero hard hexagon model monte carlo monte carlo method one approximate approach that particularly well suited computers the monte carlo method which examines just few the possible states the with the states chosen randomly with fair long these states form representative sample the whole set states the the approximate characteristic function more and more random samples are the errors are reduced arbitrarily low the metropolis hastings algorithm classic monte carlo method which was initially used sample the canonical path integral monte carlo also used sample the canonical other for rarefied ideal approaches such the cluster expansion use perturbation theory include the effect weak leading virial expansion for dense another approximate approach based reduced distribution functions particular the radial distribution

canonical mixed methods involving equilibrium statistical mechanical results see may non equilibrium statistical mechanics non equilibrium thermodynamics there are many physical phenomena interest that involve thermodynamic processes out for heat transport the internal motions material driven temperature electric currents carried the motion charges conductor driven voltage spontaneous chemical reactions driven decrease free friction dissipation quantum decoherence systems being pumped external forces optical pumping etc and irreversible processes all these processes occur over time with characteristic and these rates are importance for the field equilibrium statistical mechanics concerned with understanding these equilibrium processes the microscopic statistical thermodynamics can only used calculate the final after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down non equilibrium statistical mechanics could mathematically ensembles for isolated system evolve over time according deterministic equations such liouville equation its quantum the von neumann equation these equations are the result applying the mechanical equations motion independently each state the unfortunately these ensemble evolution equations inherit much the complexity the underling mechanical and exact solutions are very difficult moreover the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and not destroy information the gibbs entropy order make headway modelling irreversible necessary add additional ingredients besides probability and reversible non equilibrium mechanics therefore active area theoretical research the range validity these additional assumptions continues few approaches are described the following stochastic methods one approach equilibrium statistical mechanics incorporate stochastic behaviour into the stochastic behaviour destroys information contained the while this technically inaccurate aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes system cannot itself cause loss the randomness added reflect that information interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the correlations between the system and these correlations appear chaotic pseudorandom influences the variables replacing these correlations with randomness the calculations can made much boltzmann transport equation early form stochastic mechanics appeared even before the term statistical had been studies kinetic theory james clerk maxwell had demonstrated that molecular collisions would lead apparently chaotic motion inside ludwig boltzmann subsequently showed taking this molecular chaos for granted complete the motions particles gas would follow simple boltzmann transport equation that would rapidly restore gas equilibrium state see theorem the boltzmann transport equation and related approaches are important tools equilibrium statistical mechanics due their extreme these approximations work well systems where the interesting information immediately after just one scrambled into subtle which essentially restricts them rarefied the boltzmann transport equation has been found very useful simulations electron transport lightly doped semiconductors transistors where the electrons are indeed analogous rarefied quantum technique related theme the random phase approximation bbgky hierarchy liquids and dense not valid immediately discard the correlations between particles after one the bbgky hierarchy yvon gives method for deriving type equations but also extending them beyond the dilute gas include correlations after few keldysh formalism negf equilibrium green quantum approach including stochastic dynamics found the keldysh this approach often used electronic quantum transport calculations near equilibrium methods another important class equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with systems that are only very slightly perturbed from with very small the response can

total essentially system that slightly away from whether put there external forces relaxes towards equilibrium the same since the system cannot tell the difference know how came away from this provides indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such ohmic conductivity and thermal conductivity extracting results from equilibrium statistical since equilibrium statistical mechanics mathematically well defined and some more amenable for the dissipation connection can convenient shortcut for calculations equilibrium statistical few the theoretical tools used make this connection fluctuation

introduced the concept equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time equilibrium statistical with his theorem the term statistical was coined the american mathematical physicist willard gibbs note probabilistic might today seem more appropriate but statistical firmly shortly before his gibbs published elementary principles statistical mechanics book which formalized
