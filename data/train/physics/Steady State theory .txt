notes and citations further reading history sir james jeans the was the first conjecture steady state cosmology based hypothesized continuous creation matter the the idea was then revised fred hoyle thomas gold hermann bondi and the steady state theory bondi and gold was inspired the circular plot the film dead night which they had watched theoretical calculations showed that static universe was impossible under general relativity and observations edwin hubble had shown that the universe was the steady state theory asserts that although the universe nevertheless does not change its appearance over time the perfect cosmological principle has beginning and problems with the state theory began emerge the late when observations apparently supported the idea that the universe was fact quasars and radio galaxies were found only large distances therefore could have existed only the distant not closer whereas the big bang theory predicted the steady state theory predicted that such objects would found throughout the including close our own for most the refutation the state theory came with the discovery the cosmic microwave background radiation which was predicted the big bang stephen hawking described this discovery the final nail the coffin the state the state theory explained microwave background radiation the result light from ancient stars that has been scattered galactic however the cosmic microwave background level very even all making difficult explain how could generated numerous point sources and the microwave background radiation shows evidence characteristics such polarization that normally associated with furthermore its spectrum close that ideal black body that could hardly formed the superposition contributions from multitude dust clumps different temperatures well different redshifts steven weinberg wrote the steady state model does not appear agree with the observed versus relation with source counts the disagreement credit the alone among all the state model makes such definite predictions that can disproved even with the limited observational evidence our the state model attractive that many its adherents still retain hope that the evidence against will disappear observations however the cosmic microwave background radiation really body will difficult doubt that the universe has evolved from denser early since this the big bang theory has been considered provide the best explanation the origin the most astrophysical the big bang implicitly accepted and used the basis more complete quasi steady state quasi steady state cosmology was proposed fred hoyle geoffrey burbidge and jayant narlikar new incarnation the steady state ideas meant explain additional features unaccounted for the initial the theory suggests pockets creation occurring over time within the sometimes referred minibangs mini creation little bangs after the observation accelerating universe further modifications the model were other proponents chaotic inflation theory has many similarities with steady state however much larger scale than originally the field and the notion steady state universe that has some resemblance chaotic inflation theory eternal inflation which sometimes posits infinite universe with neither beginning nor which inflation operates scale beyond the observable universe create the matter the however both steady state and steady state assert that the creation events the universe new hydrogen atoms the steady state can observed within the observable universe whereas inflationary theories not posit inflation
