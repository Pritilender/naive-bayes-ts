physics	stellar structure navigation search stars different mass and age have varying internal structures stellar structure models describe the internal structure star detail and make detailed predictions about the luminosity the color and the future evolution the contents energy transport equations stellar structure rapid evolution see also references general references external links energy transport different layers the stars transport heat and outwards different primarily convection and radiative transfer but thermal conduction important white dwarfs convection the dominant mode energy transport when the temperature gradient steep enough that given parcel gas within the star will continue rise rises slightly via adiabatic process this the rising parcel buoyant and continues rise warmer than the surrounding the rising particle cooler than the surrounding will fall back its original regions with low temperature gradient and low enough opacity allow energy transport via radiation the dominant mode energy the internal structure main sequence star depends upon the mass the solar mass stars solar masses including the sun hydrogen helium fusion occurs primarily via proton proton chains which not establish steep temperature thus radiation dominates the inner portion solar mass the outer portion solar mass stars cool enough that hydrogen neutral and thus opaque ultraviolet convection therefore solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes the outer portion the massive stars greater than about solar masses the core temperature above about hydrogen helium fusion occurs primarily via the cno cycle the cno the energy generation rate scales the temperature the whereas the rate scales the temperature the power the proton due the strong temperature sensitivity the cno the temperature gradient the inner portion the star steep enough make the core convective the outer portion the the temperature gradient shallower but the temperature high enough that the hydrogen nearly fully the star remains transparent ultraviolet thus massive stars have radiative envelope the lowest mass main sequence stars have radiation the dominant energy transport mechanism throughout the star giants are also fully equations stellar structure the simplest commonly used model stellar structure the spherically symmetric static which assumes that star steady state and that spherically symmetric contains four basic order differential equations two represent how matter and pressure vary with two represent how temperature and luminosity vary with forming the stellar structure equations exploiting the assumed spherical one considers the matter density temperature total pressure matter plus luminosity and energy generation rate per unit mass spherical shell thickness distance from the center the the star assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium the temperature identical for matter and photons although lte does not strictly hold because the temperature given shell sees below itself always hotter than the temperature this approximation normally excellent because the photon mean free path much smaller than the length over which the temperature varies first statement hydrostatic equilibrium the outward force due the pressure gradient within the star exactly balanced the inward force due gravity where the cumulative mass inside the shell and the gravitational constant the cumulative mass increases with radius according the mass continuity equation integrating the mass continuity equation from the star center the radius the star yields the total mass the considering the energy leaving the spherical shell yields the energy where the luminosity produced the form neutrinos which usually escape the star without interacting with ordinary per unit outside the core the where nuclear reactions energy the luminosity the energy transport equation takes differing forms depending upon the mode energy for conductive luminosity transport appropriate for white dwarf the energy equation where the thermal conductivity the case radiative energy appropriate for the inner portion solar mass main sequence star and the outer envelope massive main sequence where the opacity the the stefan boltzmann constant and the boltzmann constant set the case convective luminosity transport appropriate for radiative portions main sequence stars and all giants and low mass does not have known rigorous mathematical and involves turbulence the convective energy transport usually modeled using mixing length theory this treats the gas the star containing discrete elements which roughly retain the density and pressure their surroundings but move through the star far characteristic called the mixing length for monatomic ideal gas when the convection adiabatic meaning that the convective gas bubbles exchange heat with their mixing length theory yields where the adiabatic index the ratio specific heats the for fully ionized ideal gas when the convection not the true temperature gradient not given this for the sun the convection the base the convection near the adiabatic but that near the surface the mixing length theory contains two free parameters which must set make the model fit phenomelogical theory rather than rigorous mathematical also required are the equations state relating the opacity and energy generation rate other local variables appropriate for the such density chemical etc relevant equations state for pressure may have include the perfect gas radiation pressure due degenerate etc opacity cannot expressed exactly single calculated for various compositions specific densities and temperatures and presented tabular stellar structure codes meaning computer programs calculating the either interpolate temperature grid obtain the opacity use fitting function based the tabulated similar situation occurs for accurate calculations the pressure equation finally the nuclear energy generation rate computed from particle physics using reaction networks compute reaction rates for each individual reaction step and equilibrium abundances for each isotope the combined with set boundary conditions solution these equations completely describes the behavior the typical boundary conditions set the values the observable parameters appropriately the surface and center the meaning the pressure the surface the star there mass inside the center the required the mass density remains finite the total mass the star the and the temperature the surface the effective temperature the although nowadays stellar evolution models describes the main features color magnitude diagrams important improvements have made order remove uncertainties which are linked the limited knowledge transport the most difficult challenge remains the numerical treatment some research teams are developing simplified modelling turbulence rapid evolution the above simplified model not adequate without modification situations when the composition changes are sufficiently the equation hydrostatic equilibrium may need modified adding radial acceleration term the radius the star changing very for example the star radially also the nuclear burning not the core rapidly entropy term must added the energy see also star portal polytrope scale height
