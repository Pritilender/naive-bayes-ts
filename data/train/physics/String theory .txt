called strings string theory aims explain all types observed elementary particles using quantum states these addition the particles postulated the standard model particle physics string theory naturally incorporates gravity and candidate for theory everything contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms matter besides this hypothesized role particle string theory now widely used theoretical tool physics and has shed light many aspects quantum field theory and quantum gravity the earliest version string called bosonic string theory incorporated only the class particles known bosons although this theory developed into superstring theory which posits that connection supersymmetry exists between bosons and the class particles called fermions string theory requires the existence extra spatial dimensions for its mathematical realistic physical models constructed from string these extra dimensions are typically compactified extremely small string theory was first studied the late theory the strong nuclear force before being abandoned favor the theory quantum chromodynamics subsequently was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable theory nuclear physics made outstanding candidate for quantum theory gravity after five consistent versions string theory were was realized the that these theories could obtained different limits conjectured dimensional theory called theory many theoretical physicists including stephen hawking edward witten and juan maldacena believe that string theory step towards the correct fundamental description nature this because string theory allows for the consistent combination quantum field theory and general relativity agrees with general insights quantum gravity such the

books general critical textbooks for physicists for mathematicians online material external links overview the starting point for string theory the idea that the like particles elementary particle physics can also modeled dimensional objects called strings according string strings can oscillate many distance scales larger than the string each oscillation mode gives rise different species with its mass charge and other properties determined the splitting and recombination strings correspond particle emission and giving rise the interactions between analogy for modes vibration guitar production multiple distinct musical this different notes correspond different string one the modes oscillation the string corresponds spin particle such particle called graviton since mediates force which has the properties gravity since string theory believed mathematically consistent quantum mechanical the existence this graviton state implies that string theory theory quantum gravity string theory includes both open strings which have two distinct and closed strings which form complete the two types string behave slightly different yielding different particle for all string theories have closed string graviton modes but only open strings can correspond the particles known photons because the two ends open string can always meet and forming closed all string theories contain closed the earliest string the bosonic string incorporated only the class particles known bosons this model low enough quantum gravity theory which also includes open strings are incorporated gauge bosons such the however this model has what most significant that the theory has fundamental believed result the decay least spacetime the name the spectrum particles contains only particles like the obey particular rules roughly bosons are the constituents but not which made fermions investigating how string theory may include fermions led the invention supersymmetry mathematical relation between bosons and string theories that include fermionic vibrations are now known superstring theories several kinds have been but all are now thought different limits theory called theory since string theory incorporates all the fundamental including many physicists hope that fully describes our making theory everything one the goals current research string theory find solution the theory that quantitatively identical with the standard model with small cosmological containing dark matter and plausible mechanism for cosmic inflation not yet known whether string theory has such nor known how much freedom the theory allows choose the one the challenges string theory that the full theory does not yet have satisfactory definition all the scattering strings most straightforwardly defined using the techniques perturbation theory but not known general how define string theory nonperturbatively also not clear whether there any principle which string theory selects its vacuum state the spacetime configuration that determines the properties our universe see string theory landscape strings the motion like particle can described drawing graph its position with respect the resulting picture depicts the worldline the particle spacetime analogous one can draw graph depicting the progress string time the which looks like small line will sweep out dimensional surface known the worldsheet the different string modes giving rise different such the photon graviton appear waves this closed string looks like small its worldsheet will look like open string looks like segment with two its worldsheet will look like more mathematical these are both riemann surfaces the strip having boundary and the pipe world lines particles standard model world sheet strings strings can join and this reflected the form their more its topology for closed string its worldsheet will look like single pipe splitting into two this topology often referred pair pants see drawing closed string splits and its two parts later its worldsheet will look like single pipe splitting two and then which also looks like torus connected two pipes one representing the incoming and the other representing the outgoing open string doing the same thing will have worldsheet that looks like annulus connected two quantum mechanics one computes the probability for point particle propagate from one point another summing certain quantities called probability amplitudes each amplitude associated with different worldline the this process summing amplitudes over all possible worldlines called path integration string one computes probabilities similar summing quantities associated with the worldsheets joining initial string configuration final this sense that string theory extends quantum field replacing point particles quantum field the classical behavior fields determined action functional which string theory can either the nambu goto action the polyakov action branes brane brane string theory and related theories such supergravity theories brane physical object that generalizes the notion point particle higher for point particle can viewed brane dimension while string can viewed brane dimension also possible consider dimensional dimension these are called the word brane comes from the word membrane which refers dimensional branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according the rules quantum mechanics they have mass and can have other attributes such charge brane sweeps out dimensional volume spacetime called its worldvolume physicists often study fields analogous the electromagnetic field which live the worldvolume string branes are important class branes that arise when one considers open open string propagates through its endpoints are required lie the letter brane refers the fact that impose certain mathematical condition the system known the dirichlet boundary condition the study branes string theory has led important results such the ads cft correspondence which has shed light many problems quantum field branes are also frequently studied from purely mathematical point view since they are related subjects such homological mirror symmetry and noncommutative geometry mathematically branes may represented objects certain categories such the derived category coherent sheaves calabi yau manifold the fukaya category dualities the term duality refers situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out equivalent nontrivial two theories are related means that one theory can transformed some way that ends looking just like the other the two theories are then said dual one another under the put the two theories are mathematically different descriptions the same addition providing candidate for theory everything string theory provides many examples dualities between different physical theories and can therefore used tool for understanding the relationships between these and duality duality duality duality these are dualities between string theories which relate seemingly different large and small distance well strong and weak coupling are quantities that have always marked very distinct limits behavior physical system both classical and quantum physics but strings can obscure the difference between large and strong and and this how these five very different theories end being duality relates the large and small distance scales between string whereas duality relates strong and weak coupling strengths between string duality links duality and theory theory before the string theorists believed there were five distinct superstring type type iia type iib and the two flavors heterotic string theory and the thinking was that out these five candidate only one was the actual correct theory everything and that theory was the one whose low energy with ten spacetime dimensions compactified down matched the physics observed our world now believed that this picture was incorrect and that the five superstring theories are related one another the dualities described the existence these dualities suggests that the five string theories are fact special cases more fundamental theory called theory bosons fermions particle tachyon supersymmetry fermions chiral heterotic extra dimensions number dimensions intriguing feature string theory that predicts extra classical string theory the number dimensions not fixed any consistency however make consistent quantum string theory required live spacetime the called critical dimension must have spacetime dimensions for the bosonic string and for the superstring this necessary ensure the vanishing the conformal anomaly the worldsheet conformal field theory modern understanding indicates that there exist less trivial ways satisfying this cosmological solutions exist wider variety and these different dimensions are related dynamical the dimensions are more precisely different values the effective central count degrees freedom that reduces dimensionality weakly curved one such theory the dimensional theory which requires spacetime have eleven opposed the usual three spatial dimensions and the fourth dimension the original string theories from the describe special cases theory where the eleventh dimension very small circle and these formulations are considered then string theory requires ten but the theory also describes universes like with four observable spacetime well universes with flat space and also cases where the position some the dimensions described complex number rather than real the notion spacetime dimension not fixed string best thought different different nothing maxwell theory electromagnetism einstein theory relativity makes this kind these theories require physicists insert the number dimensions manually and and this number fixed and independent potential string theory allows one relate the number dimensions scalar potential technical this happens because gauge anomaly exists for every separate number predicted and the gauge anomaly can counteracted including nontrivial potential energy into equations solve furthermore the absence potential energy the critical explains why flat spacetime solutions are this can better understood noting that photon included consistent theory particle carrying force related unbroken gauge symmetry must massless the mass the photon that predicted string theory depends the energy the string mode that represents the this energy includes contribution from the casimir effect namely from quantum fluctuations the the size this contribution depends the number since for larger number dimensions there are more possible fluctuations the string therefore the photon flat spacetime will and the theory only for particular number when the calculation the critical dimensionality not four one may expect three axes space and one the subset equal the relation photon fluctuations linear flat space string theories are dimensional the bosonic while superstring and theories turn out involve dimensions for flat bosonic string the dimensions come from the polyakov starting from any dimension greater than necessary consider how these are reduced dimensional spacetime compact dimensions calabi yau manifold projection two ways have been proposed resolve this apparent the first compactify the extra the extra dimensions are small undetectable day retain high degree these compactification spaces must very reflected their holonomy dimensional manifold must have structure particular case torsionless this being holonomy making calabi yau space and dimensional manifold must have structure with holonomy again being simple case such spaces have been studied attempts relate string theory the dimensional standard model part due the computational simplicity afforded the assumption more progress has been made constructing more realistic compactifications without the degree symmetry yau manifolds citation needed standard analogy for this consider multidimensional space garden the hose viewed from sufficient appears have only one its indeed think ball just small enough enter the throwing such ball inside the the ball would move more less one any experiment make throwing such balls the the only important movement will that along the however one approaches the one discovers that contains second its thus ant crawling inside would move two dimensions and fly flying would move three this extra only visible within relatively close range the one throws small enough similarly the extra compact dimensions are only visible extremely small experimenting with particles with extremely small wavelengths the order the compact which quantum mechanics means very high energies see wave particle duality brane world scenario another possibility that are stuck dimensional three spatial dimensions plus one time subspace the full properly localized matter and mills gauge fields will typically exist the spacetime exceptional set the larger these exceptional are ubiquitous yau folds and may described subspaces without local akin crease sheet paper crack the neighborhood which markedly different from the exceptional subspace however until the work randall and was not known that gravity can properly localized spacetime may containing strata various allowing inhabit the dimensional such geometries occur naturally yau such spacetimes are branes hence such models are known brane world scenarios effect the hidden dimensions either gravity acting the hidden dimensions affects other gravitational forces such kaluza early work demonstrated that general relativity five dimensions actually predicts the existence however because the nature calabi yau manifolds new forces appear from the small but their shape has profound effect how the forces between the strings appear our dimensional therefore possible deduce the nature those extra dimensions requiring consistency with the standard model but this not yet practical also possible extract information regarding the hidden dimensions precision tests but far these have only put upper limitations the size such hidden testability and experimental predictions although great deal recent work has focused using string theory construct realistic models particle physics several major difficulties complicate efforts test models based string the most significant the extremely small size the planck length which expected close the string length the characteristic size where strings become easily distinguishable from another issue the huge number metastable vacua string which might sufficiently diverse accommodate almost any phenomena might observe lower string harmonics one unique prediction string theory the existence string harmonics sufficiently high the like nature particles would become there should heavier copies all corresponding higher vibrational harmonics the not clear how high these energies most conventional string they would close the planck energy which times higher than the energies accessible the newest particle accelerator the lhc making this prediction impossible test with any particle accelerator the near however models with large extra dimensions they could potentially produced the energies not far above its cosmology string theory currently understood makes series predictions for the structure the universe the largest many phases string theory have very positive vacuum energy regions the universe that are such phase will inflate exponentially rapidly process known eternal inflation the theory predicts that most the universe very rapidly however these expanding phases are not and can decay via the nucleation bubbles lower vacuum since our local region the universe not very rapidly string theory predicts are inside such the spatial curvature the universe inside the bubbles that form this process testable moreover other bubbles will eventually form the parent vacuum outside the bubble and collide with these collisions lead potentially observable imprints however possible that neither these will observed the spatial curvature too small and the collisions are too under certain fundamental strings produced near the end inflation can stretched astronomical these cosmic strings could observed various for instance their gravitational lensing effects however certain field theories also predict cosmic strings arising from topological defects the field supersymmetry supersymmetry confirmed supersymmetry could also considered circumstantial because all consistent string theories are however the absence supersymmetric particles energies accessible the lhc would not necessarily disprove string since the energy scale which supersymmetry broken could well above the ads cft correspondence ads cft correspondence the conformal field theory correspondence relationship which says that string theory certain cases equivalent quantum field theory more one considers string theory anti sitter background this means that the geometry spacetime obtained perturbing certain solution einstein equation the this possible define notion boundary the cft correspondence states that this boundary can regarded the spacetime for quantum field and this field theory equivalent the bulk gravitational theory the sense that there dictionary for translating calculations one theory into calculations the examples the correspondence the most famous example the cft correspondence states that type iib string theory the product ads equivalent super mills theory the dimensional conformal another realization the correspondence states that theory ads equivalent the abjm superconformal field theory three yet another realization states that theory ads equivalent the called theory six applications quantum chromodynamics ads qcd since relates string theory ordinary quantum field the cft correspondence can used theoretical tool for doing calculations quantum field for the correspondence has been used study the quark gluon plasma exotic state matter produced particle the physics the gluon plasma governed quantum chromodynamics the fundamental theory the strong nuclear force but this theory mathematically intractable problems involving the gluon order understand certain properties the gluon theorists have therefore made use the cft one version this correspondence relates string theory certain supersymmetric gauge theory called super mills theory the latter theory provides good approximation quantum chromodynamics one can thus translate problems involving the gluon plasma into problems string theory which are more using these theorists have computed the shear viscosity the gluon these predictions were confirmed the relativistic heavy ion collider brookhaven national laboratory applications condensed matter physics string theory methods have been applied problems condensed matter physics certain condensed matter systems are difficult understand using the usual methods quantum field and the cft correspondence may allow physicists better understand these systems describing them the language string some success has been achieved using string theory methods describe the transition superfluid insulator connections mathematics addition influencing research theoretical physics string theory has stimulated number major developments pure mathematics like many developing ideas theoretical string theory does not present have mathematically rigorous formulation which all its concepts can defined physicists who study string theory are often guided physical intuition conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used formalize different parts the these conjectures are later proved and this string theory has served source new ideas pure mirror symmetry mirror symmetry string one the ways which string theory influenced mathematics was through the discovery mirror symmetry string the shape the unobserved spatial dimensions typically encoded mathematical objects called calabi yau manifolds these are interest pure and they can used construct realistic models physics from string the late was noticed that given such physical not possible uniquely reconstruct corresponding yau instead one finds that there are two calabi yau manifolds that give rise the same these manifolds are said mirror one the existence this mirror symmetry relationship between different yau manifolds has significant mathematical consequences allows mathematicians solve many problems enumerative algebraic geometry today mathematicians are still working develop mathematical understanding mirror symmetry based intuition vertex operator algebras vertex operator algebra monstrous moonshine addition mirror applications string theory pure mathematics include results the theory vertex operator algebras for ideas from string theory were used richard borcherds prove the monstrous moonshine conjecture relating the monster group construction arising group theory branch and modular functions class functions which are important number theory history this section does not cite any references sources please help improve this section adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and removed february history string theory early results some the structures reintroduced string theory arose for the first time much earlier part the program classical unification started albert einstein the first person add fifth dimension general relativity was german mathematician theodor kaluza who noted that gravity five dimensions describes both gravity and electromagnetism the swedish physicist oskar klein gave physical interpretation the unobservable extra wrapped into small einstein introduced non symmetric metric tensor while much later brans and dicke added scalar component these ideas would revived within string where they are demanded consistency string theory was originally developed during the late and early never completely successful theory hadrons the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that feel the strong interaction the geoffrey chew and steven frautschi discovered that the mesons make families called regge trajectories with masses related spins way that was later understood yoichiro nambu holger bech nielsen and leonard susskind the relationship expected from rotating chew advocated making theory for the interactions these trajectories that did not presume that they were composed any fundamental but would construct their interactions from self consistency conditions the matrix the matrix approach was started werner heisenberg the way constructing theory that did not rely the local notions space and which heisenberg believed break down the nuclear while the scale was off many orders the approach advocated was ideally suited for theory quantum working with experimental dolen horn and schmid developed some sum rules for hadron when particle and antiparticle virtual particles can exchanged two qualitatively different the the two particles annihilate make temporary intermediate states that fall apart into the final state the the particles exchange intermediate states emission and field the two contributions add one giving continuous background the other giving peaks certain the was clear that the peaks were stealing from the the authors interpreted this saying that the channel contribution was dual the channel meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the the result was widely advertised murray mann leading gabriele veneziano construct scattering amplitude that had the property schmid later renamed sheet the amplitude needed poles where the particles straight line and there special mathematical function whose poles are evenly spaced half the real the gamma function which was widely used regge manipulating combinations gamma veneziano was able find consistent scattering amplitude with poles straight with mostly positive which obeyed duality and had the appropriate regge scaling high the amplitude could fit beam scattering data well other regge type and had suggestive integral representation that could used for over the next hundreds physicists worked complete the bootstrap program for this with many veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude describe the scattering particle that appears the obvious consistency the lightest particle must tachyon miguel virasoro and joel shapiro found different amplitude now understood that closed while ziro koba and holger nielsen generalized integral representation multiparticle veneziano and sergio fubini introduced operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was forerunner sheet conformal while virasoro understood how remove the poles with sign residues using constraint the claud lovelace calculated loop and noted that there inconsistency unless the dimension the theory charles thorn peter goddard and richard brower went prove that there are sign propagating states dimensions less than equal yoichiro nambu holger bech nielsen and leonard susskind recognized that the theory could given description space and time terms the scattering amplitudes were derived systematically from the action principle peter goddard jeffrey goldstone claudio rebbi and charles thorn giving time picture the vertex operators introduced veneziano and fubini and geometrical interpretation the virasoro conditions pierre ramond added fermions the which led him formulate dimensional supersymmetry cancel the sign john schwarz and andr neveu added another sector the fermi theory short time the fermion the critical dimension was stanley mandelstam formulated world sheet conformal theory for both the bose and fermi giving dimensional field theoretic integral generate the operator michio kaku and keiji kikkawa gave different formulation the bosonic string field theory with infinitely many particle types and with fields taking values not but loops and tamiaki yoneya discovered that all the known string theories included massless two particle that obeyed the correct ward identities john schwarz and joel scherk came the same conclusion and made the bold leap suggest that string theory was theory not theory they reintroduced kaluza klein theory way making sense the extra the same quantum chromodynamics was recognized the correct theory shifting the attention physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program the dustbin history string theory eventually made out the but for the following decade all work the theory was completely still the theory continued develop steady pace thanks the work handful ferdinando gliozzi joel and david olive realized that the original ramond and neveu strings were separately inconsistent and needed the resulting theory did not have and was proven have time supersymmetry john schwarz and michael green the same alexander polyakov gave the theory modern path integral and went develop conformal field theory daniel friedan showed that the equations motions string which are generalizations the einstein equations general relativity emerge from the renormalization group equations for the dimensional field schwarz and green discovered and constructed two superstring iia and iib related and type theories with open the consistency conditions had been that the entire theory was nearly uniquely with only few discrete first superstring revolution the early edward witten discovered that most theories quantum gravity could not accommodate chiral fermions like the this led collaboration with luis study violations the conservation laws gravity theories with anomalies concluding that type string theories were green and schwarz discovered contribution the anomaly that witten and had which restricted the gauge group the type string theory coming understand this edward witten became convinced that string theory was truly consistent theory and became profile following between and hundreds physicists started work this and this sometimes called the first superstring revolution during this david gross jeffrey harvey emil martinec and ryan rohm discovered heterotic strings the gauge group these closed strings was two copies and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard philip candelas gary horowitz andrew strominger and edward witten found that the yau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve realistic amount while lance dixon and others worked out the physical properties orbifolds distinctive geometrical singularities allowed string cumrun vafa generalized duality from circles arbitrary creating the mathematical field mirror symmetry daniel friedan emil martinec and stephen shenker further developed the covariant quantization the superstring using conformal field theory david gross and vipul periwal discovered that string perturbation theory was stephen shenker showed diverged much faster than field theory suggesting that new perturbative objects were the joseph polchinski discovered that the theory requires dimensional called branes and identified these with the hole solutions these were understood the new objects suggested the perturbative and they opened new field with rich mathematical quickly became clear that branes and other not just formed the matter content the string and the physical interpretation the strings and branes was they are type black leonard susskind had incorporated the holographic principle gerardus hooft into string identifying the long highly excited string states with ordinary thermal black hole suggested the fluctuations the black hole the sheet volume describes not only the degrees freedom the black but all nearby objects second superstring revolution edward witten the annual conference string theorists the university southern california edward witten gave speech string theory that essence united the five string theories that existed the and giving birth new dimensional theory called theory theory was also foreshadowed the work paul townsend approximately the same the flurry activity that began this time sometimes called the second superstring revolution during this tom banks willy fischler stephen shenker and leonard susskind formulated matrix full holographic description theory using iia branes this was the first definition string theory that was fully perturbative and concrete mathematical realization the holographic principle example gravity duality and now understood special case the ads cft correspondence andrew strominger and cumrun vafa calculated the entropy certain configurations branes and found agreement with the classical answer for extreme charged black petr ava and witten found the dimensional formulation the heterotic string showing that orbifolds solve the chirality witten noted that the effective description the physics branes low energies supersymmetric gauge and found geometrical interpretations mathematical structures gauge theory that and nathan seiberg had earlier discovered terms the location the juan maldacena noted that the low energy excitations theory near black hole consist objects close the which for extreme charged black holes looks like anti sitter space noted that this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the hypothesized that string theory horizon charged hole desitter space times sphere with equally well described the energy limiting gauge theory the supersymmetric mills theory this which called the ads cft correspondence was further developed steven gubser igor klebanov and alexander polyakov and edward witten and now concrete realization the holographic principle which has reaching implications for black holes locality and information well the nature the gravitational through this string theory has been shown related gauge theories like quantum chromodynamics and this has led more quantitative understanding the behavior hadrons bringing string theory back its criticisms some critics string theory say that failure theory everything notable critics include peter woit lee smolin philip warren anderson sheldon glashow lawrence krauss carlo rovelli and bert schroer some common criticisms very high energies needed test quantum gravity lack uniqueness predictions due the large number lack background high energies widely believed that any theory quantum gravity would require extremely high energies probe higher orders magnitude than those that current experiments such the large hadron collider can this because strings themselves are expected only slightly larger than the planck length which twenty orders magnitude smaller than the radius and high energies are required probe small length generally quantum gravity difficult test because gravity much weaker than the other and because quantum effects are controlled constant very small the effects quantum gravity are extremely number solutions string theory currently understood has huge number called string and these vacua might sufficiently diverse accommodate almost any phenomena might observe lower the vacuum structure the called the string theory landscape the anthropic portion string theory not well string theory contains infinite number distinct stable and perhaps these more correspond universe roughly similar with four high planck gauge and chiral each these corresponds different possible with different collection particles and what can used select among these vacua open while there are continuous parameters the there very large set possible which may radically different from each also suggested that the landscape surrounded even more vast swampland looking semiclassical effective field which are actually citation needed some physicists believe this good because may allow natural anthropic explanation the observed values physical constants particular the small value the cosmological constant the argument that most universes contain values for physical constants that not lead habitable universes least for and happen live the friendliest universe this principle already employed explain the existence life earth the result friendly orbit around the sized sun among infinite number possible orbits well relatively stable location the background independence background independence separate and older criticism string theory that string theory describes perturbative expansions about fixed spacetime backgrounds which means that mathematical calculations the theory rely preselecting background starting this like many quantum field theories much string theory still only formulated perturbatively divergent series citation needed although the defined perturbative expansion fixed not background has some features that suggest perturbative approaches would topology change established process string and the exchange gravitons equivalent change the since there are dynamic corrections the background spacetime the perturbative one would expect spacetime dynamic the nonperturbative theory well since they would have predict the same citation needed this criticism has been addressed some extent the ads cft duality which believed provide non perturbative definition string theory spacetimes with anti sitter space asymptotics nevertheless non perturbative definition the theory arbitrary spacetime backgrounds still some hope that theory non perturbative treatment string theory such background independent open string field theory will have
