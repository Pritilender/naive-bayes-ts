measurements the number neutrinos produced the sun were lower than theories predicted factor this discrepancy was resolved through the discovery the effects neutrino oscillation the sun emits the number neutrinos predicted the theory but neutrino detectors were missing them because the neutrinos had changed flavor the time they were nasa radiative zone radiative zone below about solar solar material hot and dense enough that thermal radiation the primary means energy transfer from the this zone not regulated thermal convection however the temperature drops from approximately million kelvin with increasing distance from the this temperature gradient less than the value the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive energy transferred radiation ions hydrogen and helium emit photons which travel only brief distance before being reabsorbed other the density drops hundredfold from only from solar radii the top the radiative the radiative zone and the convective zone are separated transition the tachocline this region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation the radiative zone and the differential rotation the convection zone results large condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one the fluid motions found the convection zone slowly disappear from the top this layer its matching the calm characteristics the radiative zone the presently hypothesized see solar dynamo that magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the magnetic field convective zone convection zone the outer from its surface approximately below the solar

helios twenty five years helium was isolated atmosphere corona coronal loop solar eclipse corona the parts the sun above the photosphere are referred collectively the solar atmosphere they can viewed with telescopes operating across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio through visible light gamma rays and comprise five principal the temperature minimum the chromosphere the transition region the corona and the heliosphere the coolest layer the sun temperature minimum region about above the with temperature about this part the sun cool enough allow the existence simple molecules such carbon monoxide and which can detected via their absorption the transition and corona are much hotter than the surface the the reason has not been conclusively evidence suggests that alfv waves may have enough energy heat the above the temperature minimum layer layer about thick dominated spectrum emission and absorption called the chromosphere from the greek root chroma meaning because the chromosphere visible colored flash the beginning and end total solar eclipses the temperature the chromosphere increases gradually with ranging around near the the upper part the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized hinode above the thin about transition region the temperature rises rapidly from around the upper chromosphere coronal temperatures closer the temperature increase

influence from the and the boundary with the interstellar medium magnetic field stellar magnetic field plasma heliospheric current sheet plasma interplanetary medium the sun magnetically active supports changing magnetic field that varies year and reverses direction about every eleven years around solar maximum the magnetic field leads many effects that are collectively called solar activity including sunspots the surface the solar flares and variations solar wind that carry material through the solar the effects solar activity earth include auroras moderate high latitudes and the disruption radio communications and electric power solar activity thought have played large role the formation and evolution the solar system solar activity changes the structure outer atmosphere all matter the sun the form gas and high plasma this makes possible for the sun rotate faster its equator about days than does more extreme latitudes about days near its the differential rotation the latitudes causes its magnetic field lines become twisted together over producing magnetic field loops erupt from the surface and trigger the formation the dramatic sunspots and solar prominences see magnetic reconnection this twisting action creates the solar dynamo and year solar cycle magnetic activity the magnetic field reverses itself about every years the solar magnetic field extends well beyond the sun the magnetized solar wind plasma carries the magnetic field into space forming what called the interplanetary magnetic field since the plasma can only move along the magnetic field the interplanetary magnetic field initially stretched radially away from the because the fields north and south the solar equator have different polarities pointing toward and away from the there exists thin current layer the solar equatorial which called the heliospheric current sheet great the rotation the sun twists the magnetic field and the current sheet into the archimedean spiral like structure called the parker spiral the interplanetary magnetic field much stronger than the dipole component the solar magnetic the dipole magnetic field the reduces with the cube the distance about

surrounding the chemical composition stereo extreme from point the surface interior there are molecules roald hoffmann molecules stars the sun composed primarily the chemical elements hydrogen and helium they account for and the mass the sun the respectively all heavier called metals account for less than the the most abundant metals are oxygen roughly the carbon neon and iron the sun inherited its chemical composition from the interstellar medium out which the hydrogen and helium the sun were produced big bang nucleosynthesis and the metals were produced stellar nucleosynthesis generations stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material the interstellar medium before the formation the the chemical composition the photosphere normally considered representative the composition the primordial solar however since the sun some the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the therefore photosphere the helium fraction reduced and the metallicity only that the protostellar phase before nuclear fusion the core the protostellar composition was reconstructed hydrogen helium and metals the inner portions the nuclear fusion has modified the composition converting hydrogen into the innermost portion the sun now roughly helium with the metal abundance because the interior the sun not convective see radiative zone above none the fusion products from the core have risen the the reactive core zone hydrogen where hydrogen converted into starting surround the core helium this development will continue and will eventually cause the sun leave the main sequence become red giant the solar element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy the photosphere and measuring abundances meteorites that have never been heated melting these meteorites are thought retain the composition the protostellar sun and are thus not affected settling heavy the two methods generally agree singly ionized iron group elements the much research focused the abundances iron group elements the although significant research was the abundance determination some iron group elements cobalt and manganese was still difficult least far because their hyperfine structures the first largely complete set oscillator strengths singly ionized iron group elements were made available first the and improved oscillator strengths were computed the abundances singly elements the iron group were solar and planetary mass fractionation relationship various authors have considered the existence mass fractionation relationship between the isotopic compositions solar and planetary noble gases for example correlations between isotopic compositions planetary and solar neon and xenon nevertheless the belief that the whole sun has the same composition the solar atmosphere was still least until was claimed that was the fractionation the sun itself that caused the fractionation relationship between the isotopic compositions planetary and solar wind implanted noble solar cycles sunspots list solar cycles sunspots and the sunspot cycle when observing the sun with appropriate the most immediately visible features are usually its sunspots which are defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because lower sunspots are regions intense magnetic activity where convection inhibited strong magnetic reducing energy transport from the hot interior the the magnetic field causes strong heating the forming active regions that are the source intense solar flares and coronal mass ejections the largest sunspots can tens thousands kilometers the number sunspots visible the sun not but varies over year cycle known the solar cycle typical solar few sunspots are and occasionally none all can those that appear are high solar the sunspot cycle the number sunspots increases and they move closer the equator the phenomenon described law sunspots usually exist pairs with opposite magnetic the magnetic polarity the leading sunspot alternates every solar that will north magnetic pole one solar cycle and south magnetic pole the the solar cycle has great influence space weather and significant influence the climate since the luminosity has direct relationship with magnetic solar activity minima tend correlated with colder and longer than average solar cycles tend correlated with hotter the the solar cycle appeared have stopped entirely for several few sunspots were observed during this during this known the maunder minimum little ice age europe experienced unusually cold earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis tree rings and appear have coincided with average global possible term cycle recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities the core the sun that cause fluctuations with periods either years these could provide better explanation the ice ages than the milankovitch cycles life phases formation and evolution the solar system stellar evolution the sun today roughly halfway through the most stable part its has not changed dramatically for four billion years and will remain fairly stable for four billion however after hydrogen fusion its core has the sun will undergo severe both internally and formation the sun was formed about billion years ago from the collapse part giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly hydrogen and helium and which probably gave birth many other this age estimated using computer models stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology the result consistent with the radiometric date the oldest solar system billion years studies ancient meteorites reveal traces stable daughter nuclei lived such iron that form only short lived this indicates that one more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the sun shock wave from nearby supernova would have triggered the formation the sun compressing the gases within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions collapse under their own one fragment the cloud collapsed also began rotate due conservation angular momentum and heat with the increasing much the mass became concentrated the while the rest flattened out into disk which would become the planets and other solar system gravity and pressure within the core the cloud generated lot heat accreted more gas from the surrounding eventually triggering nuclear fusion thus the sun was main sequence luminosity radius effective temperature the sun about halfway through its main sequence stage during which nuclear fusion reactions its core fuse hydrogen into each more than four million tonnes matter are converted into energy within the producing neutrinos and solar radiation this the sun has far converted around earth masses matter into the sun will spend total approximately billion years sequence after core hydrogen exhaustion main sequence the sun does not have enough mass explode supernova instead will exit the main sequence approximately billion years and start turn into red giant calculated that the sun will become sufficiently large engulf the current orbits the solar system inner planets possibly including even before becomes red the luminosity the sun will have nearly and the earth will hotter than venus once the core hydrogen exhausted billion the sun will expand into subgiant phase and slowly double size over about half billion will then expand more rapidly over about half billion years until over two hundred times larger than today and couple thousand times more this then starts the red giant branch phase where the sun will spend around billion years and lose around third its hertzsprung russell diagram after rgb the sun now has only about million years active life but they are highly first the core ignites violently the helium flash and the sun shrinks back around times its current size with times the with temperature little lower than has now reached the red clump horizontal branch but star the mass does not evolve blueward along the instead just becomes mildly larger and more luminous over about million years continues burn helium the when the helium the sun will repeat the expansion followed when the hydrogen the core was except that this time all happens and the sun becomes larger and more this the asymptotic giant branch phase and the sun alternately burning hydrogen shell helium deeper after about million years the early the sun becomes increasingly with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for few hundred years every years the thermal pulses become larger each with the later pulses pushing the luminosity much times the current level and the radius over models vary depending the rate and timing mass models that have higher mass loss the rgb produce less luminous stars the tip the perhaps only times the luminosity and less than times the for the four thermal pulses are predicted before completely loses its outer envelope and starts make planetary nebula the end that phase lasting approximately years the sun will only have about half its current the post agb evolution even the luminosity stays approximately constant while the temperature with the ejected half the mass becoming ionised into planetary nebula the exposed core reaches the final naked core temperature will over after which the remnant will cool towards white dwarf the planetary nebula will disperse about years but the white dwarf will survive for trillions years before fading earth fate future the earth the long the water and most its atmosphere will eventually escape into during the life the main sequence the sun becoming more luminous about every billion the present the surface temperature the sun almost the increase luminosity essentially due slow increase the solar the increase solar luminosity such that about another billion years the water will evaporate and escape into rendering the planet inhospitable all known terrestrial the earth not expected survive the transition into red its the sun will have maximum radius beyond the current times the present radius the the time the sun has entered the asymptotic red giant the orbits the planets will have drifted outwards due loss roughly the present most this mass will lost the solar wind also tidal acceleration will help boost the earth higher orbit similar what the earth does the were only for earth would probably remain outside the however current research suggests that after the sun becomes red earth will pulled owing tidal deceleration sunlight sunlight sunlight primary source the only other source energy the earth

addition perturbations due the galactic spiral arms and uniform mass addition the sun oscillates and down relative the galactic plane approximately times per has been argued that the passage through

travel barycenter the motion about the center mass the solar system complicated perturbations from the the barycenter just outside the volume the sun when jupiter and saturn the two planets with the greatest are roughly the same seen from the when they are opposite and the other planets are aligned the barycentre can very close the centre the every few hundred years this motion switches between prograde and retrograde theoretical problems stereo sdo coronal heating problem corona the optical surface the sun the photosphere known have temperature approximately above lies the solar rising temperature the high temperature the corona shows that heated something other than direct heat conduction from the thought that the energy necessary heat the corona provided turbulent motion the convection zone below the and two main mechanisms have been proposed explain coronal the first wave heating which gravitational magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced turbulence the convection these waves travel upward and dissipate the depositing their energy the ambient gas the form the other magnetic heating which magnetic energy continuously built photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection the form large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller nanoflares currently unclear whether waves are efficient heating all waves except alfv waves have been found dissipate refract before reaching the alfv waves not easily dissipate the current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating faint young sun problem faint young sun paradox theoretical models the development suggest that billion years during the archean period the sun was only about bright such weak star would not have been able sustain liquid water the and thus life should not have been able however the geological record demonstrates that the earth has remained fairly constant temperature throughout its and that the young earth was somewhat warmer than the consensus among scientists that the young atmosphere contained much larger quantities greenhouse gases such carbon dioxide methane and ammonia than are present which trapped enough heat compensate for the smaller amount solar energy reaching the history observation early understanding trundholm sun chariot nordic bronze age national museum denmark the sun culture like other natural the sun has been object veneration many

the fixed stars the sun appears from earth revolve once year along the ecliptic through the zodiac and greek astronomers considered one the seven planets greek planetes after which the seven days the week are named some development scientific understanding play media the early first millennium babylonian astronomers observed that the motion along the ecliptic was not though they were unaware why this today known that this due the movement the earth elliptic orbit around the with the earth moving faster when nearer the sun perihelion and moving slower when farther away aphelion one the first people offer scientific philosophical explanation for the sun was the greek philosopher anaxagoras who reasoned that was giant flaming ball metal even larger than the peloponnesus rather than the chariot helios and that the moon reflected the light the for teaching this heresy was imprisoned the authorities and sentenced death though was later released through the intervention pericles eratosthenes estimated the distance between the earth and the sun the century stadia myriads and the translation which implying either stadia stadia million kilometers the latter value correct within few the century ptolemy estimated the distance times the earth radius approximately million kilometers the theory that the sun the center around which the planets move was first proposed the ancient greek aristarchus samos the century and later adopted seleucus seleucia see heliocentrism this largely philosophical view was developed into fully predictive mathematical model heliocentric system the century nicolaus copernicus the early the invention the telescope permitted detailed observations sunspots thomas harriot galileo galilei and other galileo made some the first known telescopic observations sunspots and posited that they were the surface the sun rather than small objects passing between the earth and the sunspots were also observed since the han dynasty chinese astronomers who maintained records these observations for averroes also provided description sunspots the arabic astronomical contributions include albatenius discovery that the direction the apogee the place the orbit against the fixed stars where seems moving modern heliocentric this caused gradual motion the aphelion the earth orbit ibn yunus observed more than entries for the position for many years using large astrolabe guido bonatti liber astronomiae the transit venus was first observed persian astronomer and polymath avicenna who concluded that venus closer the earth than the giovanni cassini and jean richer determined the distance mars and were thereby able calculate the distance the isaac newton observed the light using prism and showed that was made light many while william herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part the solar the century saw advancement spectroscopic studies the joseph von fraunhofer recorded more than absorption lines the the strongest which are still often referred fraunhofer lines the early years the modern scientific the source the energy was significant lord kelvin suggested that the sun was gradually cooling liquid body that was radiating internal store kelvin and hermann von helmholtz then proposed gravitational contraction mechanism explain the energy but the resulting age estimate was only million well short the time span least million years suggested some geological discoveries that joseph lockyer who discovered helium the solar proposed meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution the not until was documented solution ernest rutherford suggested that the output could maintained internal source and suggested radioactive decay the however would albert einstein who would provide the essential clue the source the energy output with his mass energy equivalence relation sir arthur eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures the core the sun could produce nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen into helium resulting production energy from the net change the preponderance hydrogen the sun was confirmed cecilia payne using the ionization theory developed meghnad saha indian the theoretical concept fusion was developed the the astrophysicists subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and hans bethe hans bethe calculated the details the two main producing nuclear reactions that power the finally seminal paper entitled synthesis the elements stars was published margaret burbidge geoffrey burbidge william fowler and fred hoyle the paper demonstrated convincingly that most the elements the universe had been synthesized nuclear reactions inside some like the solar space missions solar observatory play media stereo the first satellites designed observe the sun were nasa pioneers and which were launched between and these probes orbited the sun distance similar that the earth and made the first detailed measurements the solar wind and the solar magnetic pioneer operated for

included the first observations coronal mass ejections then called coronal and coronal holes now known intimately associated with the solar wind the solar maximum mission was launched nasa this spacecraft was designed observe gamma rays rays and radiation from solar flares during time high solar activity and solar luminosity just few months after however electronics failure caused the probe into standby and spent the next three years this inactive space shuttle challenger mission retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before releasing into the solar maximum mission subsequently acquired thousands images the solar corona before entering the atmosphere june launched japan yohkoh sunbeam satellite observed solar flares ray mission data allowed scientists identify
