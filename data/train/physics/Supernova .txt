described detail chinese and islamic astronomers the widely observed supernova produced the crab nebula supernovae and the latest observed with the naked eye the milky way had notable effects the development astronomy europe because they were used argue against the aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the moon and planets was johannes kepler began observing october was the second supernova observed generation after seen tycho brahe since the development the telescope the field supernova discovery has extended other starting with the observation supernova andromedae the andromeda galaxy american astronomers rudolph minkowski and fritz zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning the astronomers found that the maximum intensities supernova explosions could used standard candles hence indicators astronomical some the most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than this supports the view that the expansion the universe accelerating techniques were developed for reconstructing supernova explosions that have written records being the date the cassiopeia supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae while the age supernova remnant was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the decay titanium nitrates were discovered antarctic ice deposits that matched the times past supernova discovery history supernova observation telescope observation early work what was originally believed simply new category novae was performed during the walter baade and fritz zwicky mount wilson the name super novae was first used during lectures held caltech baade and then used publicly meeting the american physical society the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was because supernovae are relatively rare events within occurring about three times century the milky obtaining good sample supernovae study requires regular monitoring many supernovae other galaxies cannot predicted with any meaningful normally when they are they are already most scientific interest standard candles for measuring for require observation their peak therefore important discover them well before they reach their amateur astronomers who greatly outnumber professional have played important role finding typically looking some the closer galaxies through optical telescope and comparing them earlier toward the end the century astronomers increasingly turned controlled telescopes and ccds for hunting while such systems are popular with there are also professional installations such the katzman automatic imaging telescope recently the supernova early warning system project has begun using network neutrino detectors give early warning supernova the milky way neutrinos are particles that are produced great quantities supernova and they are not significantly absorbed the interstellar gas and dust the galactic supernova searches fall into two those focused relatively nearby events and those looking for explosions farther because the expansion the universe the distance remote object with known emission spectrum can estimated measuring its doppler shift redshift more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those and have higher thus the search split between high redshift and low with the boundary falling around redshift range where dimensionless measure the frequency high redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation supernova light these are useful for standard calibrated candles generate hubble diagrams and make cosmological supernova used study the physics and environments more practical low than high low redshift observations also anchor the distance end the hubble which plot distance versus redshift for visible see also hubble law naming convention type supernova ngc supernova discoveries are reported the international astronomical union central bureau for astronomical telegrams which sends out circular with the name assigns that the name the marker followed the year suffixed with one letter the first supernovae the year are designated with capital letter from afterward pairs case letters are and hence for designates the third supernova reported the year the last supernova was indicating that was the supernova found since professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds supernovae each year historical supernovae are known simply the year they called tycho nova and kepler star since the additional letter notation has been even there was only one supernova discovered that year etc this last happened with for standard until two letter designations were rarely since however they have been needed every classification part the attempt understand astronomers have classified them according their light curves and the absorption lines different chemical elements that appear their spectra the first element for division the presence absence line caused hydrogen spectrum contains lines hydrogen known the balmer series the visual portion the classified type otherwise type each these two types there are subdivisions according the presence lines from other elements the shape the light curve graph the apparent magnitude function type ionized silicon thermal runaway helium core collapse type type type iin iib type the type supernovae are subdivided the basis their with type showing strong ionised silicon absorption type supernovae without this strong line are classified types and with type showing strong neutral helium lines and type lacking the light curves are all although type are generally brighter peak but the light curve not important for classification type small number type supernovae exhibit unusual features such standard luminosity broadened light and these are typically classified referring the earliest example showing similar for example the luminous often referred like class type the supernovae can also divided based their while most supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities many thousands kilometres per second some such have relatively narrow features their these are called where the stands for few such and appear change they show lines hydrogen early but over period weeks become dominated lines the term used describe the combination features normally associated with and type supernovae with normal spectra dominated broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life the decline are classified the basis their light the most common type shows distinctive plateau the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline these are called type referring the less common are type supernovae that lack distinct the signifies linear although the light curve not actually straight supernovae that not fit into the normal classifications are designated current models ngc the type codes described above that astronomers give supernovae are taxonomic the type number describes the light observed from the not necessarily its for type supernovae are produced runaway fusion ignited degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type are produced from massive rayet progenitors core the following summarizes what astronomers currently believe are the most plausible explanations for thermal runaway type supernova white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from stellar companion raise its core temperature enough ignite carbon fusion which point undergoes runaway nuclear completely disrupting there are three avenues which this detonation theorized stable accretion material from the collision two white accretion that causes ignition shell that then the dominant mechanism which type supernovae are produced remains despite this uncertainty how type supernovae are type supernovae have very uniform and are useful standard candles over intergalactic some calibrations are required compensate for the gradual change properties different frequencies abnormal luminosity supernovae high red and for small variations brightness identified light curve shape normal type there are several means which supernova this type can but they share common underlying carbon oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter reach the chandrasekhar limit about solar masses for rotating would longer able support the bulk its plasma through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin however the current view that this limit not normally increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion the star approaches the limit within about before collapse within few substantial fraction the matter the white dwarf undergoes nuclear releasing enough energy joules unbind the star supernova outwardly expanding shock wave with matter reaching velocities the order roughly the speed there also significant increase reaching absolute magnitude billion times brighter than the with little the model for the formation this category supernova closed binary star system the larger the two stars the first evolve off the main sequence and expands form red giant the two stars now share common causing their mutual orbit the giant star then sheds most its losing mass until can longer continue nuclear fusion this point becomes white dwarf composed primarily carbon and eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence form red matter from the giant accreted the white causing the latter increase despite widespread acceptance the basic the exact details initiation and the heavy elements produced the explosion are still type supernovae follow characteristic light curve the graph luminosity function after the this luminosity generated the radioactive decay nickel through cobalt iron the peak luminosity the light curve extremely consistent across normal type having maximum absolute magnitude about this allows them used secondary standard candle measure the distance their host galaxies non standard type another model for the formation type explosion involves the merger two white dwarf with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the chandrasekhar there much variation this type and many cases there may supernova but expected that they will have broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal type abnormally bright type supernovae are expected when the white dwarf already has mass higher than the chandrasekhar possibly enhanced further but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic there formal classification for the standard type has been proposed that group luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto white dwarf should classified type this type supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf core collapse very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion suddenly becomes unable sustain the core against its own this the cause all types supernova except type the collapse may cause violent expulsion the outer layers the star resulting the release gravitational potential energy may insufficient and the star may collapse into black hole neutron star with little radiated core collapse can caused several different electron capture exceeding the chandrasekhar limit pair instability photodisintegration when massive star develops iron core larger than the chandrasekhar mass will longer able support itself electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further neutron star black electron capture magnesium degenerate core causes gravitational collapse followed explosive oxygen with very similar electron positron pair production large helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed runaway resulting instability sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate rays energetic enough initiate photodisintegration which will cause complete collapse the the table below lists the known reasons for core collapse massive the types star that they occur their associated supernova and the remnant the metallicity the proportion elements other than hydrogen compared the the initial mass the mass the star prior the supernova given multiples the although the mass the time the supernova may much type iin supernovae are not listed the they can potentially produced various types core collapse different progenitor possibly even type white dwarf although seems that most will from iron core collapse luminous supergiants hypergiants including lbvs the narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova expanding into small dense cloud circumstellar gamma ray burst when stellar core longer supported against gravity collapses itself with velocities reaching resulting rapid increase temperature and what follows next depends the mass and structure the collapsing with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely black and degenerate cores undergoing runaway the initial collapse degenerate cores accelerated beta decay photodisintegration and electron which causes burst electron neutrinos the density neutrino emission cut off they become trapped the the inner core eventually reaches typically diameter and density comparable that atomic nucleus and neutron degeneracy pressure tries halt the the core mass more than about solar masses then neutron degeneracy insufficient stop the collapse and black hole forms directly with supernova lower mass cores the collapse stopped and the newly formed neutron core has initial temperature about billion kelvin times the temperature the neutrinos form antineutrino pairs all flavors and total several times the number capture about approximately the rest converted into second burst neutrinos which the main output the the suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces shock wave that stalls within milliseconds the outer core energy lost through the dissociation heavy process that not clearly understood necessary allow the outer layers the core reabsorb around joules foe from the neutrino producing the visible although there are also other theories how power the some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron and for cores beyond about eight solar masses there sufficient fallback form black this fallback will reduce the kinetic energy the explosion and the mass expelled radioactive but some situations may also generate relativistic jets that result ray burst exceptionally luminous collapse massive degenerate cores will ignite further when the core collapse initiated pair oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may for core masses solar the collapse halts and the star remains but core collapse will occur again when larger core has for cores around solar the fusion oxygen and heavier elements energetic that the entire star causing the upper end the mass the supernova unusually luminous and extremely lived due many solar masses ejected for even larger core the core temperature becomes high enough allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into black type type supernova stars with initial masses less than about eight times the sun never develop core large enough collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres become white stars with least nine possibly much solar masses material evolve complex progressively burning heavier elements hotter temperatures their the star becomes layered like with the burning more easily fused elements occurring larger although popularly described onion with iron the least massive supernova progenitors only have cores these super agb stars may form the majority core collapse although less luminous and less commonly observed than those from more massive when core collapse occurs during supergiant phase when the star still has hydrogen the result the rate mass loss for luminous stars depends the metallicity and extremely luminous stars near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and will not form low all stars will reach core collapse with hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly black hole without producing visible stars with initial mass about times the little less high are expected result type supernova which the most commonly observed moderate high stars near the upper end that mass range will have lost most their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will very low stars around solar masses will reach core collapse pair instability while they still have hydrogen atmosphere and oxygen core and the result will supernova with characteristics but very large mass ejected and high type and type and supernovae ray these like those are massive stars that undergo core however the stars which become and supernovae have lost most their outer envelopes due strong stellar winds else from interaction with these stars are known wolf rayet stars and they occur moderate high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss observations type supernova not match the observed expected occurrence wolf rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type core collapse supernova involve stars stripped their hydrogen binary binary models provide better match for the observed with the proviso that suitable binary helium stars have ever been since supernova explosion can occur whenever the mass the star the time core collapse low enough not cause complete fallback black any massive star may result supernova loses enough mass before core collapse type supernovae are the more common and result from rayet stars type which still have helium their for narrow range stars evolve further before reaching core collapse become stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors type few percent the supernovae are associated with gamma ray bursts though also believed that any stripped supernova could produce depending the geometry the the mechanism for producing this type grb the jets produced the magnetic field the rapidly spinning magnetar formed the collapsing core the the jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell the explosion produce luminous light curves the visual light curves the different supernova types vary shape and based the underlying mechanisms the the way that visible radiation and the transparency the ejected the light curves can significantly different other for and shorter wavelengths there extremely luminous peak lasting just few corresponding the shock breakout the initial which hardly detectable longer the light curves for are mostly very with consistent maximum absolute magnitude and relatively steep decline the energy output driven radioactive decay half life days which then decays radioactive half life days these radioisotopes from material ejected the explosion excite surrounding material the initial phases the light curve decline steeply the effective size the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation the light curve continues decline the band while may show small shoulder the visual about days but this only hint secondary maximum that occurs the red certain ionised heavy elements recombine produce red radiation and the ejecta become transparent the visual light curve continues decline rate slightly greater than the decay rate the radioactive cobalt which has the longer half life and controls the later because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able convert the high energy radiation into visual after several the light curve changes its decline rate again positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining although this portion the light curve has been type and light curves are basically similar although with lower average peak the visual light output again due radioactive decay being converted into visual but there much lower mass produced these types the peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type supernovae orders magnitude more and less luminous than the the most luminous type supernovae are referred hypernovae and tend have broadened light curves addition the increases peak the source the extra energy thought relativistic jets driven the formation rotating black which also produce gamma ray bursts the light curves for supernovae are characterised much slower decline than the order magnitudes per excluding the plateau the visual light output dominated kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several due primarily the existence hydrogen the ejecta from the atmosphere the supergiant progenitor the initial explosion this hydrogen becomes heated and the majority supernovae show prolonged plateau their light curves this hydrogen emitting visible light and becoming more this then followed declining light curve driven radioactive decay although slower than due the efficiency conversion into light all the the plateau absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left its sufficient appear the spectrum but insufficient produce noticeable plateau the light iib supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere the progenitor depleted thought due tidal stripping companion that the light curve closer supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several type iin supernovae are characterised additional narrow spectral lines produced dense shell circumstellar their light curves are generally very broad and occasionally also extremely luminous and referred hypernova these light curves are produced the highly efficient conversion kinetic energy the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation interaction with the dense shell this only occurs when the material sufficiently dense and indicating that has been produced the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova large numbers supernovae have been catalogued and classified provide distance candles and test average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type host but can broadly specified for each supernova absolute magnitude foe faint types may distinct bright types may continuum from slightly luminous these magnitudes are measured the measurements bands are common and will around half magnitude brighter for order magnitude kinetic total electromagnetic radiated energy usually neutrino energy much probably heterogeneous any the other types embedded asymmetry pulsar crab nebula standing puzzle surrounding type supernovae why the compact object remaining after the explosion given large velocity away from the pulsars and thus neutron are observed have high and black holes presumably although they are far harder observe the initial impetus can propelling object more than solar mass velocity this indicates asymmetry the but the mechanism which momentum transferred the compact object remains proposed explanations for this kick include convection the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star one possible explanation for the asymmetry the explosion scale convection above the the convection can create variations the local abundances resulting uneven nuclear burning during the bounce and resulting another possible explanation that accretion gas onto the central neutron star can create disk that drives highly directional propelling matter high velocity out the and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the these jets might play crucial role the resulting supernova similar model now favored for explaining long gamma ray bursts initial asymmetries have also been confirmed supernova explosions through this result may mean that the initial luminosity this type supernova depends the viewing however the explosion becomes more symmetrical with the passage early asymmetries are detectable measuring the polarization the emitted energy output although are used thinking supernovae primarily luminous visible the electromagnetic radiation they produce almost minor effect the particularly the case core collapse the emitted electromagnetic radiation tiny fraction the total event there fundamental difference between the balance energy production the different types type white dwarf most the explosion energy directed into heavy element synthesis and kinetic energy the core collapse the vast majority the energy directed into neutrino emission and while some this apparently powers the main explosion the neutrinos escape the first few minutes following the start the type supernovae derive their energy from runaway nuclear fusion oxygen white details the energetics are still not fully but the end result the ejection the entire mass the original star with high kinetic around half solar mass this generated from silicon radioactive and generates beta plus decay with half life six plus gamma itself decays the beta plus path with half life days stable these two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type combination with the changing transparency the ejected they produce the rapidly declining light core collapse supernovae are average visually fainter than type but the total energy released far this driven gravitational potential energy from the core initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating followed all flavours thermal neutrinos from the heated neutron star around these neutrinos are thought deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers the star drive the resulting but again the details cannot reproduced exactly current kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type hence the reduced visual but energy from the ionisation the many solar masses remaining hydrogen can contribute much slower decline luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen the majority core collapse foe some core collapse fallback onto black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce brief energetic and directional burst gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected this one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and thought the cause type hypernovae and long duration gamma ray bursts the relativistic jets are too brief and fail penetrate the stellar envelope then low luminosity ray burst may produced and the supernova may when supernova occurs inside small dense cloud circumstellar material then will produce shock wave that can efficiently convert high fraction the kinetic energy into electromagnetic even though the initial explosion energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since does not rely exponential radioactive this type event may cause type iin although instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar type the nature the explosion following core collapse more like giant type with runaway fusion oxygen and the total energy released the highest mass events comparable other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production thought very hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy very the cores these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected can orders magnitude with consequently high visual progenitor the supernova classification type closely tied the type star the time the the occurrence each type supernova depends dramatically the metallicity and hence the age the host type supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars binary systems and occur all galaxy types core collapse supernovae are only found galaxies undergoing current very recent star since they result from lived massive they are most commonly found type spirals but also the arms other spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies especially starburst galaxies type and and possibly most type supernovae are only thought produced from stars having solar metallicity levels that result high mass loss from massive hence they are less common older more distant the table shows the expected progenitor for the main types core collapse and the approximate proportions each the local wolf rayet rayet supergiant supergiant supergiant lbv supergiant blue supergiant there are number difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading core collapse red supergiants are the expected progenitors for the vast majority core collapse and these have been observed but only relatively low now proposed that higher mass red supergiants not explode but instead evolve back blue until just few decades hot supergiants were not considered likely but observations have shown blue supergiants form high proportion confirmed supernova partly due their high while not single wolf rayet progenitor has yet been the expected progenitors type luminous are not observed instead stars are found lower apparently red supergiant stars are extremely rare and visually relatively difficult say whether such progenitors are missing just yet models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass reach supernova without progressing different evolutionary one study has shown possible route for luminosity red supergiant luminous blue variables most likely type iin very small number yellow supergiant supernova progenitors have been again these are difficult requiring unexpectedly high mass loss interstellar impact source heavy elements supernova nucleosynthesis supernovae are key source elements heavier than oxygen these elements are produced nuclear fusion for iron and lighter and nucleosynthesis during the supernova explosion for elements heavier than supernovae are the most although not candidate sites for the process which rapid form nucleosynthesis that occurs under conditions high temperature and high density the reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich neutrons these forms are unstable and rapidly beta decay into more stable the process which likely occur type produces about half all the element abundance beyond including plutonium and uranium the only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron the process old red giant which produces these elements much more and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead role stellar evolution supernova remnant the remnant supernova explosion consists compact object and rapidly expanding shock wave this cloud material sweeps the surrounding interstellar medium during free expansion which can last for two the wave then gradually undergoes period adiabatic expansion and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over period about large magellanic cloud the big bang produced hydrogen helium and traces lithium while all heavier elements are synthesized stars and supernovae tend enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with metals elements other than hydrogen and these injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites star thus each stellar generation has slightly different going from almost pure mixture hydrogen and helium more rich supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier which are formed star during its period nuclear the different abundances elements the material that forms star have important influences the and may decisively influence the possibility having planets orbiting the kinetic energy expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation due compression dense molecular clouds the increase turbulent pressure can also prevent
