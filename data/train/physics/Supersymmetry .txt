symmetry that relates two basic classes elementary bosons which have valued spin and fermions which have integer each particle from one group associated with particle from the called its superpartner whose spin differs theory with perfectly unbroken supersymmetry each pair superpartners shares the same mass and internal quantum numbers besides spin for selectron superpartner would boson version the electron and would have the same mass energy and thus equally easy find the however since superpartners have been observed supersymmetry must spontaneously broken symmetry citation needed supersymmetry true symmetry would explain many mysterious features particle physics and would help solve paradoxes such the cosmological constant problem the minimal supersymmetric standard model one the best studied candidates for physics beyond the standard model the failure the large hadron collider find evidence for supersymmetry has led some physicists suggest that the theory should abandoned solution such any superpartners that exist would now need too massive solve the paradoxes experiments with the large hadron collider also yielded extremely rare particle decay events which casts doubt many versions supersymmetry differs notably from currently known symmetries that establishes symmetry between classical and quantum which now has not been observed any other while any number bosons can occupy the same quantum state for fermions this not possible because the exclusion principle which allows only one fermion given but when the occupation numbers become quantum physics approaches the classical limit this means that while bosons also exist classical fermions that makes difficult expect that possess the same quantum numbers there only indirect evidence for the existence

and baryons was first the context hadronic hironari miyazawa this supersymmetry did not involve that concerned internal and was badly his work was largely ignored the gervais and sakita golfand and likhtman also and volkov and akulov independently rediscovered supersymmetry the context quantum field radically new type symmetry spacetime and fundamental which establishes relationship between elementary particles different quantum bosons and and unifies spacetime and internal symmetries the microscopic supersymmetry with consistent algebraic graded structure which the sakita rediscovery was based directly first arose the context early version string theory pierre ramond john schwarz and andr neveu finally wess and zumino identified the characteristic renormalization features dimensional supersymmetric field which singled them out remarkable and they and abdus salam and their fellow researchers introduced early particle physics the mathematical structure supersymmetry graded lie superalgebras has subsequently been applied successfully other areas variety ranging from nuclear physics critical phenomena quantum mechanics statistical physics remains vital part many proposed theories the first realistic supersymmetric version the standard model was proposed howard georgi and savas dimopoulos and called the minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm for was proposed solve the hierarchy problem and predicts superpartners with masses between gev and tev september meaningful signs the superpartners have been the large hadron collider cern producing the highest energy collisions and offers the best chance discovering superparticles for the foreseeable after the discovery the higgs particle was expected that supersymmetric particles would found but there has been still evidence the lhcb and cms experiments the lhc made the first definitive observation strange meson decaying into two confirming standard model but blow for those hoping for signs neil turok perimeter institute concedes that theorists are disheartened that and that they are crossroad theoretical and physics calling deep described the lhc results yet extremely and said have get people try find the new principles that will explain the motivations central motivation for supersymmetry close the tev energy scale the resolution the hierarchy problem the standard model without the extra supersymmetric the higgs boson mass subject quantum corrections which are large naturally drive close the planck mass barring its fine tuning extraordinarily tiny the supersymmetric theory the other these quantum corrections are canceled those from the corresponding superpartners above the supersymmetry breaking which becomes the new characteristic natural scale for the higgs other attractive features scale supersymmetry are the fact that often provides candidate dark matter particle mass scale consistent with thermal relic abundance provides natural mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and allows for the precise energy unification the weak the strong and electromagnetic interactions therefore scenarios where supersymmetric partners appear with masses not much greater than tev are considered the most motivated these scenarios would imply that experimental traces the superpartners should begin emerge energy collisions the lhc relatively september meaningful signs the superpartners have been which beginning significantly constrain the most popular incarnations however the total parameter space consistent supersymmetric extensions the standard model extremely diverse and can not definitively ruled out the supersymmetry also motivated solutions several theoretical for generally providing many desirable mathematical and for ensuring sensible behavior high supersymmetric quantum field theory often much easier many more problems become exactly when supersymmetry imposed local symmetry einstein theory general relativity included and the result said theory supergravity also necessary feature the most popular candidate for theory everything superstring theory another theoretically appealing property supersymmetry that offers the only loophole the coleman mandula theorem which prohibits spacetime and internal symmetries from being combined any nontrivial for quantum field theories like the standard model under very general the haag sohnius theorem demonstrates that supersymmetry the only way spacetime and internal symmetries can consistently applications extension possible symmetry groups one reason that physicists explored supersymmetry because offers extension the more familiar symmetries quantum field these symmetries are grouped into the poincar group and internal symmetries and the coleman mandula theorem showed that under certain the symmetries the matrix must direct product the group with compact internal symmetry group there mass gap the conformal group with compact internal symmetry golfand and likhtman were the first show that the algebra can extended through introduction four anticommuting spinor generators four which later became known the haag sohnius theorem analyzed all possible superalgebras the general including those with extended number the supergenerators and central charges this extended algebra paved the way for obtaining very large and important class supersymmetric field the supersymmetry algebra supersymmetry algebra traditional symmetries physics are generated objects that transform under the tensor representations the poincar group and internal supersymmetries the other are generated objects that transform under the spinor representations according the spin statistics theorem bosonic fields commute while fermionic fields anticommute combining the two kinds fields into single algebra requires the introduction grading under which the bosons are the even elements and the fermions are the odd such algebra called lie superalgebra the simplest supersymmetric extension the poincar algebra the super algebra expressed terms two weyl spinors has the following anti commutation relation and all other commutation relations between the and commutation relations between the and the above expression are the generators translation and are the pauli matrices there are representations lie superalgebra that are analogous representations lie each lie algebra has associated lie group and lie superalgebra can sometimes extended into representations lie supergroup the supersymmetric standard model minimal supersymmetric standard model incorporating supersymmetry into the standard model requires doubling the number particles since there way that any the particles the standard model can superpartners each with the addition new there are many possible new the simplest possible supersymmetric model consistent with the standard model the minimal supersymmetric standard model which can include the necessary additional new particles that are able superpartners

supersymmetric standard models there heavy stable particle such neutralino which could serve weakly interacting massive particle dark matter candidate the existence supersymmetric dark matter candidate closely tied parity the standard paradigm for incorporating supersymmetry into realistic theory have the underlying dynamics the theory but the ground state the theory does not respect the symmetry and supersymmetry broken spontaneously the supersymmetry break can not done permanently the particles the mssm they currently this means that there new sector the theory that responsible for the the only constraint this new sector that must break supersymmetry permanently and must give superparticles tev scale there are many models that can this and most their details not order parameterize the relevant features supersymmetry arbitrary soft susy breaking terms are added the theory which temporarily break susy explicitly but could never arise from complete theory

simplified nature having fields only functions time rather than great deal progress has been made this subject and now studied its own susy quantum mechanics involves pairs hamiltonians which share particular mathematical which are called partner hamiltonians the potential energy terms which occur the hamiltonians are then called partner potentials introductory theorem shows that for every eigenstate one its partner hamiltonian has corresponding eigenstate with the same this fact can exploited deduce many properties the eigenstate analogous the original description which referred bosons and can imagine bosonic whose eigenstates are the various bosons our the susy partner this hamiltonian would fermionic and its eigenstates would the each boson would have fermionic partner equal supersymmetry applications condensed matter physics susy concepts have provided useful extensions the wkb approximation susy has been applied disorder averaged systems both quantum and quantum through statistical mechanics the fokker planck equation being example quantum the all these systems arises from the fact that one modelling one particle and such don the use the supersymmetry method provides

optical wave packets along these new class functional optical structures with possible applications phase matching mode conversion and space division multiplexing becomes mathematics susy also sometimes studied mathematically for its intrinsic this because describes complex fields satisfying property known holomorphy which allows holomorphic quantities exactly this makes supersymmetric models useful toy models more realistic prime example this has been the demonstration duality dimensional gauge theories that interchanges particles and monopoles the proof the atiyah singer index theorem much simplified the use supersymmetric quantum how general supersymmetry supersymmetry appears many different contexts theoretical physics that are closely possible have multiple supersymmetries and also have supersymmetric extra extended supersymmetry extended supersymmetry possible have more than one kind supersymmetry theories with more than one supersymmetry transformation are known extended supersymmetric theories the more supersymmetry theory the more constrained the field content and interactions typically the number copies supersymmetry power four spinor has four degrees freedom and thus the minimal number supersymmetry generators four four dimensions and having eight copies supersymmetry means that there are supersymmetry the maximal number supersymmetry generators possible theories with more than supersymmetry generators automatically have massless fields with spin greater than not known how make massless fields with spin greater than two the maximal number supersymmetry generators considered this corresponds supersymmetry theories with supersymmetries automatically have graviton four dimensions there are the following with the corresponding

dimensions possible have supersymmetry dimensions other than because the properties spinors change drastically between different each dimension has its dimensions the size spinors roughly since the maximum number supersymmetries the greatest number dimensions which supersymmetric theory can exist supersymmetry quantum group supersymmetry quantum group supersymmetry can reinterpreted the language noncommutative geometry and quantum groups involves mild form namely supercommutativity see the main article for more supersymmetry quantum gravity supersymmetry part larger enterprise theoretical physics unify everything know about the physical world into single fundamental framework physical known the quest for theory everything significant part this larger enterprise the quest for theory quantum gravity which would unify the classical theory general relativity and the standard model which explains the other three basic forces physics electromagnetism the strong interaction and the weak interaction and provides palette fundamental particles upon which all four forces two the most active approaches forming theory quantum gravity are string theory and loop quantum gravity although supersymmetry could component other theoretical approaches for string theory supersymmetry appears required some level although may strongly broken particle supersymmetry recognized way stabilize the hierarchy between the unification scale and the electroweak scale the higgs boson mass and can also provide natural dark matter candidate string theory also requires extra spatial dimensions which have compactified kaluza klein theory loop quantum gravity predicts additional spatial nor anything else about particle these theories can formulated three spatial dimensions and one dimension although some lqg theories dimensionality emergent property the rather than fundamental assumption the also lqg theory quantum gravity which does not require lee smolin one the originators has proposed that loop quantum gravity theory incorporating either supersymmetry extra called loop quantum gravity experimental evidence confirms supersymmetry the form supersymmetric particles such the neutralino that often believed the lightest superpartner some people believe this would major boost string theory since supersymmetry required component string any discovered supersymmetry would consistent with string the large hadron collider and other major particle physics experiments fail detect supersymmetric partners evidence extra many versions string theory which had predicted certain low mass superpartners existing particles may need significantly the failure experiments discover either supersymmetric partners extra spatial has encouraged loop quantum gravity researchers falsifiability susy often criticized that its greatest strength and weakness that not because its breaking mechanism and the minimum mass above which restored are citation needed this minimum mass can pushed upwards arbitrarily large without disproving the symmetry and falsifiable theory generally considered unscientific especially experimental however many theoretical physicists continue focus supersymmetry because its usefulness tool quantum field its interesting mathematical and the possibility that extremely high energy physics around the time the big are described supersymmetric current status supersymmetric models are constrained variety including measurements energy for example the anomalous magnetic moment the muon brookhaven the wmap dark matter density measurement and direct detection for example xenon and particle collider including physics higgs phenomenology and direct searches for superpartners the large positron collider tevatron and the lhc historically the tightest limits were from direct production the first mass limits for squarks and gluinos were made cern the experiment and the experiment the super proton synchrotron lep later set very strong these limits were extended the experiment from wmap dark matter density measurements have strongly constrained supersymmetry which have tuned invoke particular mechanism sufficiently reduce the neutralino density prior the launch the fits available data cmssm and indicated that squarks and gluinos were most likely have masses gev though values high tev were allowed with low neutralinos and sleptons were expected quite with the lightest neutralino and the lightest stau most likely found between gev the lhc has found evidence for and has surpassed existing experimental limits from large positron collider and tevatron and partially excluded the aforementioned expected based the data sample collected the cms detector the lhc through the summer cmssm squarks have been excluded the mass tev and gluinos have been excluded gev searches are only applicable for finite set tested points because simulation using the monte carlo method must made that limits for that particular model can this complicates matters because different experiments have looked different sets some extrapolation between points can made within particular models but difficult set general limits even for the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the lhc discovered higgs boson with mass about gev and with couplings fermions and bosons which are consistent with the standard model the mssm predicts that the mass the lightest higgs boson should not much higher than the mass the boson and the absence fine tuning with the supersymmetry breaking scale the order tev should not exceed gev furthermore for values the mssm parameter tan predicts higgs mass below gev over most the parameter this region higgs mass was excluded lep the lhc result somewhat problematic for the minimal supersymmetric the value gev relatively large for the model and can only achieved with large radiative loop corrections from top squarks which many theorists consider unnatural see naturalness and fine tuning spite the null searches and the heavy recent analysis the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard the cmssm suggests that the model still compatible with all present experimental the preferred masses for squarks and gluinos about tev the resulting tuning the higgs boson mass and boson mass see problem and little hierarchy problem however considered unnatural and some theorists now favor extended supersymmetry
