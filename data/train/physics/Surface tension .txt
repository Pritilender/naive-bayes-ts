property that markedly influences the surface tension for any time object insect water striders that denser than water able float run along the water air surface tension results from the greater

elastic because the relatively high attraction water molecules for each water has high surface tension millinewtons per meter compared that most other surface tension important factor the phenomenon capillarity surface tension has the dimension force per unit length energy per unit area the two are but when referring energy per unit people use the term surface energy which more general term the

effects notes references external links causes the cohesive forces among liquid molecules are responsible for the phenomenon surface the bulk the each molecule pulled equally every direction neighboring liquid resulting net force the molecules the surface not have other molecules all sides them and therefore are pulled this creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces contract the minimal surface tension responsible for the shape liquid although easily droplets water tend pulled into spherical shape the cohesive forces the surface the absence other including gravity drops virtually all liquids would perfectly the spherical shape minimizes the necessary wall the surface layer according laplace law another way view surface tension terms molecule contact with neighbor lower state energy than were alone not contact with the interior molecules have many neighbors they can possibly but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors compared interior and therefore have higher for the liquid minimize its energy the number higher energy boundary molecules must the minimized quantity boundary molecules results minimal surface result surface area surface will assume the smoothest shape can mathematical proof that smooth shapes minimize surface area relies use the euler lagrange equation since any curvature the surface shape results greater higher energy will also consequently the surface will push back against any curvature much the same way ball pushed uphill will push back minimize its gravitational potential effects surface tension water several effects surface tension can seen with ordinary beading rain water waxy such water adheres weakly wax and strongly water clusters into surface tension gives them their spherical because sphere has the smallest possible surface area volume ratio formation drops occurs when mass liquid the animation shows water adhering the faucet gaining mass until stretched point where the surface tension can longer bind the then separates and surface tension forms the drop into stream water was running from the the stream would break into drops during its gravity stretches the then surface tension pinches into flotation objects denser than water occurs when the object nonwettable and its weight small enough borne the forces arising from surface for water striders use surface tension walk the

striders stay atop the liquid because surface tension lava lamp with interaction between dissimilar water and liquid wax photo showing the tears wine phenomenon surfactants surface tension visible other common especially when surfactants are used decrease soap bubbles have very large surface areas with very little bubbles pure water are the addition however can have stabilizing effect the bubbles see marangoni effect notice that surfactants actually reduce the surface tension water factor three emulsions are type solution which surface tension plays tiny fragments oil suspended pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger but the presence surfactant provides decrease surface which permits stability minute droplets oil the bulk water vice physics physical units surface usually represented the symbol measured forces per unit length its unit newton per meter but the cgs unit dyne per also surface area growth case surface tension may equivalently defined either through force through terms surface tension liquid half the force per unit length required keep still movable side frame over which the liquid stretched into thin visualize imagine rectangular frame which composed three unmovable sides that form shape and the movable side that can along the two parallel unmovable either towards away from the unmovable bottom side the now imagine that liquid stretched into thin film this much like soap water gets stretched over blowing ring after the ring dunked into soapy then observed that the movable side will pulled the film towards the bottom the the force required stop the movable side from sliding turns out proportional the length the movable thus the ratio depends only the intrinsic properties the liquid temperature etc but not its for the frame has more complicated the ratio with the length the movable side and the force required stop from found the same for all therefore define the surface tension the reason for the that the film has two each which contributes equally the the force contributed each side which adds total force terms surface tension liquid the ratio the change the energy the liquid and the change the surface area the liquid that led the change this can easily related the previous definition terms the force required stop the side from starting then this also the force that would keep the side the state sliding constant speed second but the side then the surface area the stretched liquid increasing while the applied force doing work the this means that increasing the surface area increases the energy the the work done the force moving the side distance the same time the total area the film increases the factor here because the liquid has two two thus multiplying both the numerator and the denominator get this work the usual arguments interpreted being stored potential consequently surface tension can also measured system joules per square meter and the cgs system ergs per since mechanical systems try find state minimum potential energy free droplet liquid naturally assumes spherical which has the minimum surface area for given the equivalence measurement energy per unit area force per unit length can proven dimensional analysis surface curvature and pressure young laplace equation force acts normal tensioned the surface must remain but the pressure one side the surface differs from pressure the other the pressure difference times surface area results normal order for the surface tension forces cancel the force due the surface must the diagram shows how surface curvature tiny patch

determine the shape water puddles menisci soap and all other shapes determined surface tension such the shape the impressions that water feet make the surface the table below shows how the internal pressure water droplet increases with decreasing for not very small drops the effect but the pressure difference becomes enormous when the drop sizes approach the molecular the limit single molecule the concept becomes for water drops different radii stp atm floating objects when object placed its weight depresses the and balanced the surface tension forces either side which are each parallel the surface the points where contacts the notice that the horizontal components the two arrows point opposite they cancel each but the vertical components point the same direction and therefore add balance the surface must not wettable for this well the weight should lower than the surface tension can liquid surface find the shape the minimal surface bounded some arbitrary shaped frame using strictly mathematical means can daunting yet fashioning the frame out wire and dipping locally minimal surface will appear the resulting film within the reason for this that the pressure difference across fluid interface proportional the mean curvature seen the young laplace equation for open soap the pressure difference hence the mean curvature and minimal surfaces have the property zero mean contact angles contact angle the surface any liquid interface between that liquid and some other note the top surface for interface between the pond water and the surface then not property the liquid but property the interface with another liquid then besides the air interface its top there also interface between the liquid and the walls the the surface tension between the liquid and air usually different greater its surface tension with the walls and where the two surfaces their geometry must such that all forces where the two surfaces they form contact angle which the angle the tangent the surface makes with the solid the diagram the right shows two tension forces are shown for the air the solid and the air the example the left where the difference between the solid and air surface less than the air surface but nevertheless that the both the vertical and horizontal forces must cancel exactly the contact known equilibrium the horizontal component canceled the adhesive the more telling balance though the vertical the vertical component must exactly cancel the water ethanol diethyl ether carbon tetrachloride glycerol acetic acid water methyl iodide mercury some solid contact angles since the forces are direct proportion their respective surface also where the solid surface the air surface the air surface the contact where concave meniscus has contact angle less than and convex meniscus has contact angle greater than this means that although the difference between the solid and air surface difficult measure can inferred from the air surface and the equilibrium contact which function the easily measurable advancing and receding contact angles see main article contact angle this same relationship exists the diagram the but this case see that because the contact angle less than the air surface tension difference must special contact angles observe that the special case silver interface where the contact angle equal the air surface tension difference exactly another special case where the contact angle exactly water with specially prepared teflon approaches contact angle occurs when the solid surface tension exactly equal the air surface methods measurement goniometer because surface tension manifests itself various offers number paths its which method optimal depends upon the nature the liquid being the conditions under which its tension and the

vacuum called torricelli the unfilled volume see diagram the notice that the mercury level the center the tube higher than the making the upper surface the mercury the center mass the entire column mercury would slightly lower the top surface the mercury were flat over the entire crossection the but the shaped top gives slightly less surface area the entire mass again the two effects combine minimize the total potential such surface shape known convex consider the surface area the entire mass including the part the surface that contact with the because mercury does not adhere glass the surface tension the mercury acts over its entire surface including where contact with the instead the tube was made out the situation would very mercury aggressively adheres copper the level mercury the center the tube will lower than the edges that would concave situation where the liquid adheres the walls its consider the part the surface area that contact with the container have negative surface the fluid then works maximize the contact surface this case increasing the area contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential that decrease enough compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls the tube sufficiently narrow and the liquid adhesion its walls sufficiently surface tension can draw liquid the tube phenomenon known capillary action the height which the column lifted given where the height the liquid the air surface the density the the radius the the acceleration due the angle contact described greater than with mercury glass the liquid will depressed rather than puddles surface pouring mercury onto horizontal flat sheet glass results puddle that has perceptible the puddle will spread out only the point where little under half centimetre and again this due the action strong surface the liquid mass flattens out because that brings much the mercury low level but the surface the same acting reduce the total surface the result the compromise puddle nearly fixed the same surface tension demonstration can done with lime water even but only surface made substance which water does not wax such water poured onto flat horizontal wax say waxed sheet will behave similarly the mercury poured onto the thickness puddle liquid surface whose contact angle given where the thicknesses the puddles will slightly less than what predicted the above formula because very few surfaces have contact angle with any when the contact angle less than the thickness given for mercury dyn and which gives for water paraffin dyn and which gives the formula also predicts that when the contact angle the liquid will spread out into thin layer over the such surface said fully wettable the the breakup

increase surface hence constant temperature and surface tension equals gibbs free energy per surface where gibbs free energy and the thermodynamics requires that all spontaneous changes state are accompanied decrease gibbs free from this easy understand why decreasing the surface area mass liquid always spontaneous provided not coupled any other energy follows that order increase surface certain amount energy must gibbs free energy defined the where enthalpy and entropy based upon this and the fact that surface tension gibbs free energy per unit possible obtain the following
