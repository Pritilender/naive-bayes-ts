telescope navigation search telescope reflecting telescope mount wilson observatory los angeles telescope instrument that aids the observation remote objects collecting electromagnetic radiation such visible light the first known practical telescopes were invented the netherlands the beginning the using glass they found use terrestrial applications and within few the reflecting telescope was which used the century many new types telescopes were including radio telescopes the and infrared telescopes the the word telescope now refers wide range instruments detecting different regions the electromagnetic spectrum and some cases other types the word telescope from the greek tele far and skopein look teleskopos was coined the greek mathematician giovanni demisiani for one galileo galilei instruments presented banquet the accademia dei lincei the starry messenger galileo had used the term perspicillum contents history types optical telescopes radio telescopes ray telescopes gamma ray

references further reading external links history history the telescope ccds kepler spacecraft the earliest recorded working telescopes were the refracting telescopes that appeared the netherlands their development credited three hans lippershey and zacharias janssen who were spectacle makers and jacob metius alkmaar galileo heard about the dutch telescope june built his own within and greatly improved upon the design the following the idea that the objective gathering could mirror instead lens was being investigated soon after the invention the refracting the potential advantages using parabolic mirrors reduction spherical aberration and chromatic aberration led many proposed designs and several attempts build reflecting telescopes isaac newton built the first practical reflecting design which now bears his the newtonian reflector the invention the achromatic lens partially corrected color aberrations present the simple lens and enabled the construction more functional refracting reflecting though not limited the color problems seen were hampered the use fast tarnishing speculum metal mirrors employed during the and early problem alleviated the introduction silver coated glass mirrors and aluminized mirrors the maximum physical size limit for refracting telescopes about meter dictating that the vast majority large optical researching telescopes built since the turn the century have been the largest reflecting telescopes currently have objectives larger than and work underway several the century also saw the development telescopes that worked wide range wavelengths from radio gamma rays the first purpose built radio telescope went into operation since tremendous variety complex astronomical instruments have been types this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may challenged and july the name telescope covers wide range most detect electromagnetic radiation but there are major differences how astronomers must about collecting light electromagnetic different frequency telescopes may classified the wavelengths light they ray telescopes using shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet light ultraviolet using shorter wavelengths than visible light optical telescopes using visible light infrared telescopes using longer wavelengths than visible light submillimetre telescopes using longer wavelengths than infrared light light comparison frequency photon energy gamma ray ray ultraviolet visible infrared microwave radio ghz wavelengths become becomes easier use antenna technology interact with electromagnetic radiation although possible make very tiny the infrared can handled much like visible however the infrared and submillimetre telescopes can operate more like radio for example the james clerk maxwell telescope observes from wavelengths from but uses parabolic aluminum the other the spitzer space telescope observing from about uses mirror reflecting also using reflecting the hubble space telescope with wide field camera can observe from about from violet infrared fresnel imager optical lens technology ray optics optics for certain ray wavelengths another threshold telescope photon energy increases shorter wavelengths and higher the use fully reflecting optics rather than incident telescopes such trace and soho use special mirrors reflect extreme ultraviolet producing higher resolution and brighter images then otherwise larger aperture does not just mean more light collected higher diffraction telescopes may also classified ground space telescope flying telescope they may also classified whether they are operated professional astronomers amateur astronomers vehicle permanent campus containing one more telescopes other instruments called observatory optical telescopes nice observatory optical telescope optical telescope gathers and focuses light mainly from the visible part the electromagnetic spectrum although some work the infrared and ultraviolet optical telescopes increase the apparent angular size distant objects well their apparent brightness order for the image photographed studied and sent telescopes work employing one more curved optical usually made from glass lenses and mirrors gather light and other electromagnetic radiation bring that light radiation focal optical telescopes are used for astronomy and many astronomical including theodolites including transits spotting scopes monoculars binoculars camera lenses and spyglasses there are three main optical the refracting telescope which uses lenses form the reflecting telescope which uses arrangement mirrors form the catadioptric telescope which uses mirrors combined with lenses form beyond these basic optical types there are many types varying optical design classified the task they perform such astrographs comet seekers solar telescope etc radio telescopes very large array radio telescope radio telescopes are directional radio antennas used for radio astronomy the dishes are sometimes constructed conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than the wavelength being multi element radio telescopes are constructed from pairs larger groups these dishes synthesize large apertures that are similar size the separation between the this process known aperture synthesis the current record array size many times the width the earth utilizing based very long baseline interferometry telescopes such the japanese halca highly advanced laboratory for communications and vsop vlbi space observatory satellite aperture synthesis now also being applied optical telescopes using optical interferometers arrays optical and aperture masking interferometry single reflecting radio telescopes are also used collect microwave radiation which used collect radiation when any visible light obstructed such from quasars some radio telescopes are used programs such seti and the arecibo observatory search for extraterrestrial ray telescopes einstein observatory ray telescope ray telescopes can use ray optics such wolter telescopes composed shaped mirrors made heavy metals that are able reflect the rays just few degrees the mirrors are usually section rotated parabola and hyperbola ellipse hans wolter outlined ways telescope could built using only this kind examples observatory using this type telescope are the einstein observatory rosat and the chandra ray observatory wolter focusing ray telescopes are possible kev gamma ray telescopes higher energy ray and gamma ray telescopes refrain from focusing completely and use coded aperture the patterns the shadow the mask creates can reconstructed form ray and ray telescopes are usually orbiting satellites flying balloons since the earth atmosphere opaque this part the electromagnetic however high energy rays and rays not form image the same way telescopes visible example this type telescope the fermi ray space telescope the detection very high energy gamma with shorter wavelength and higher frequency than regular gamma requires further example this type observatory veritas very high energy rays are still like visible whereas cosmic rays includes particles like protons and heavier discovery may allow focusing ray photon energies greater than kev the index refraction starts increase high energy particle telescopes high energy astronomy requires specialized telescopes make observations since most these particles through most metals and other types high energy particle telescopes there image forming optical system cosmic ray telescopes usually consist array different detector types spread out over large neutrino telescope consists large mass water ice surrounded array sensitive light detectors known photomultiplier tubes energetic neutral atom observatories like interstellar boundary explorer detect particles traveling certain other types telescopes astronomy not limited using electromagnetic additional information can obtained using other the detectors used observe the universe are analogous these gravitational wave detector the equivalent gravitational wave telescope used for gravitational wave astronomy neutrino detector the equivalent neutrino telescope used for neutrino astronomy types mount telescope mount telescope mount mechanical structure which supports telescope mounts are designed support the mass the telescope and allow for accurate pointing the many sorts mounts have been developed over the with the majority effort being put into systems that can track the motion the stars the earth the two main types tracking mount altazimuth mount equatorial mount atmospheric electromagnetic opacity airmass since the atmosphere opaque for most the electromagnetic only few bands can observed from the these bands are visible near infrared and portion the wave part the for this reason there are ray infrared based telescopes these have flown space even wavelength observable from the might still advantageous fly satellite due astronomical seeing electromagnetic spectrum telescopic image from different telescope types different types operating
