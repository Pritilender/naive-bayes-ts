capillary dependent largely and the basis the very useful glass such scales are valid only within convenient ranges for above the boiling point glass thermometer most materials expand with temperature but some such contract with temperature increase over some specific and then they are hardly useful thermometric material use thermometer near one its change for example its spite these most generally used practical thermometers are the empirically based especially was used for calorimetry which contributed greatly the discovery nevertheless empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged basis for theoretical empirically based beyond their base simple direct measurements ordinary physical properties thermometric can use theoretical physical and this can extend their range theoretically based scales theoretically based temperature scales are based directly theoretical especially those kinetic and quantum they rely theoretical properties idealized devices and they are more less comparable with practically feasible physical devices and theoretically based temperature scales are used provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based the accepted fundamental thermodynamic temperature scale the kelvin based ideal cyclic process envisaged for carnot heat engine ideal material which temperature scale can based the ideal gas the pressure exerted fixed volume and mass ideal gas directly proportional its some natural gases show nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can used for this was important during the development and still practical importance the ideal gas thermometer however not theoretically perfect for this because the entropy ideal gas its absolute zero temperature not positive definite which puts the gas violation the third law the physical reason that the ideal gas exactly refers the limit infinitely high temperature and zero measurement the spectrum electromagnetic radiation from ideal dimensional black body can provide accurate temperature measurement because the frequency maximum spectral radiance body radiation directly proportional the temperature the black this known wien displacement law and has theoretical explanation planck law and the bose einstein law measurement the spectrum power produced electrical resistor can also provide accurate temperature the resistor has two terminals and effect dimensional the einstein law for this case indicates that the power directly proportional the temperature the resistor and the value its resistance and the noise given frequency the power has equal contributions from every and called johnson noise the value the resistance known then the temperature can are emitted from material and their velocities are the spectrum their velocities often nearly obeys theoretical law called the maxwell boltzmann distribution which gives founded measurement temperatures for which the law there have not yet been successful

zero for zero according the third law nevertheless kelvin temperature has definite numerical that has been arbitrarily chosen this numerical value also depends the properties which has gas solid triple point that can reliably reproduced standard experimental the choice this triple point also arbitrary and the kelvin scale also called the thermodynamic scale definition the kelvin scale the thermodynamic definition temperature due framed terms idealized device called carnot engine imagined define continuous cycle states its working the cycle imagined run slowly that each point the cycle the working body state thermodynamic there are four limbs such carnot cycle the engine consists four the main one called the working two them are called heat large that their respective deformation variables are not changed transfer energy heat through wall permeable only heat the working the fourth body able exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic may called the work the substances and states the two heat reservoirs should chosen that they are not thermal equilibrium with one this means that they must different fixed one labeled here with the number hotter than the labeled here with the number this can tested connecting the heat reservoirs successively auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time convenient fixed intermediate the thermometric body should composed material that has strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount adiabatic isochoric work done order settle the structure and sense operation the carnot convenient use such material also for the working because most materials are this this hardly restriction the generality this the carnot cycle considered start from initial condition the working body that was reached the completion reversible adiabatic from the working body initially connected wall permeable only heat the heat reservoir number that during the first limb the cycle expands and does work the work the second limb the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and with energy exchanged but more energy being transferred work the work the third limb the cycle sees the working body through wall permeable only the heat reservoir contracting and accepting energy work from the work the cycle closed reversible adiabatic compression the working with energy transferred but energy being transferred work from the work with this the four limbs the reversible carnot cycle are characterized amounts energy work from the working body the work and heat from the heat reservoirs the working the amounts energy transferred heat from the heat reservoirs are measured through the changes the deformation variable the working with reference the previously known properties that the amounts work done the work and the first law the amounts energy transferred heat respectively from reservoir and from reservoir may then denoted respectively and then the absolute thermodynamic and the reservoirs are defined that such that original work postulating absolute temperature was published was based the work before the formulation the first law kelvin wrote his paper that his scale was absolute the sense that was defined independently the properties any particular kind his definitive which sets out the definition just was printed paper read this definition rests the physical assumption that there are readily available walls permeable only his detailed definition wall permeable only carath odory includes several the deformation state variable closed system represented real state thermal equilibrium between two closed systems connected wall permeable only heat means that certain mathematical relation holds between the state including the respective deformation those two systems that particular mathematical relation regarded buchdahl preferred statement the zeroth law also referring thermal contact whenever each the systems and made reach equilibrium with third system under identical the systems and are mutual may viewed statement the principle stated maxwell the all heat the same this physical idea also expressed bailyn possible version the zeroth law all diathermal walls are thus the present definition thermodynamic temperature rests the zeroth law explicitly this present definition thermodynamic temperature also rests the first law for the determination amounts energy transferred implicitly for this the second law thermodynamics provides information that establishes the virtuous character the temperature provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated this definition will lead the same ratio thermodynamic which this sense the second law thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined this way because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not thermal equilibrium with one and the cycle can imagined operate only one sense net work supplied the work numerical details are settled making one the heat reservoirs cell the triple point which defined have absolute temperature the zeroth law thermodynamics allows this definition used measure the absolute thermodynamic temperature arbitrary body making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature the body temperature intensive variable thermodynamic temperature intensive variable because equal differential coefficient one extensive variable with respect for given thus has the dimensions ratio two extensive two bodies are often considered connected contact with common which has some specific permeability such specific permeability can referred specific intensive example diathermic wall that permeable only the intensive variable for this case when the two bodies have been contact for very long and have settled permanent steady the relevant intensive variables are equal the two for diathermal this statement sometimes called the zeroth law when the body described stating its internal energy extensive function its entropy also extensive and other state variables with then the temperature equal the partial derivative the internal energy with respect the likewise when the body described stating its entropy function its internal energy and other state variables with then the reciprocal the temperature equal the partial derivative the entropy with respect the internal the above equation the absolute temperature due refers systems closed transfer and has special emphasis directly experimental presentation thermodynamics gibbs starts more abstract level and deals with systems open the transfer this development the equations and above are actually alternative definitions temperature local when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails real world bodies are often not thermodynamic equilibrium and not for study methods classical irreversible body usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into small classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled good approximation such then homogeneous and temperature exists for this for every the then local thermodynamic equilibrium said prevail throughout the makes good for say the extensive variable the extensive variable that has density per unit quantity per unit mass the but makes sense speak density temperature per unit volume quantity temperature per unit mass the the other makes sense speak the internal energy while when local thermodynamic equilibrium makes good sense speak the temperature consequently temperature can vary from point point medium that not global thermodynamic but which there local thermodynamic thus when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails temperature can regarded spatially varying local property that and this because temperature intensive kinetic theory approach temperature more thorough account this below theoretical foundation kinetic theory provides microscopic explanation based macroscopic being composed many microscopic such molecules and ions various the particles species being all explains macroscopic phenomena through the classical mechanics the microscopic the equipartition theorem kinetic theory asserts that each classical degree freedom freely moving particle has average kinetic energy where denotes boltzmann constant the translational motion the particle has three degrees except very low temperatures where quantum effects the average translational kinetic energy freely moving particle system with temperature will possible measure the average kinetic energy constituent microscopic particles they are allowed escape from the bulk the the spectrum velocities has and the average calculated from not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution the particles that remain the bulk the but sometimes good sample molecules such oxygen have more degrees freedom than single spherical they undergo rotational and vibrational motions well heating results increase temperature due increase the average translational kinetic energy the heating will also through equipartitioning the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes thus diatomic gas will require more energy input increase its temperature certain will have greater heat capacity than monatomic the process cooling involves removing internal energy from when more energy can the system absolute though this cannot achieved absolute zero the null point the thermodynamic temperature scale also called absolute were possible cool system absolute all classical motion its particles would cease and they would complete rest this classical microscopically the description quantum however matter still has zero point energy even absolute because the uncertainty principle basic theory temperature measure quality state material the quality may regarded more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale that measures and called hotness some the quality hotness refers the state material only particular and apart from bodies held steady state thermodynamic hotness varies from place not necessarily the case that material particular place state that steady and nearly homogeneous enough allow have defined hotness hotness may represented abstractly dimensional every valid temperature scale has its own one map into the hotness when two systems thermal contact are the same temperature heat transfers between when temperature difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the warmer system the colder system until they are thermal equilibrium heat transfer occurs conduction thermal experimental for example galileo and newton found that there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales nevertheless the zeroth law thermodynamics says that they all measure the same temperature for bodies thermodynamic equilibrium for experimental hotness means when comparing any two given bodies their respective separate thermodynamic equilibria any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree which the hotter the two given that they have the same this does not require the two thermometers have linear relation between their numerical scale but does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall strictly monotonic definite sense greater hotness can independently calorimetry thermodynamics and properties particular from wien displacement law thermal radiation the temperature bath thermal radiation proportional universal the frequency the maximum its frequency spectrum this frequency always but can have values that tend zero thermal radiation initially defined for cavity thermodynamic these physical facts justify mathematical statement that hotness exists ordered dimensional manifold this fundamental character temperature and thermometers for bodies their own thermodynamic except for system undergoing first order phase change such the melting closed system receives without change its volume and without change external force fields acting its temperature for system undergoing such phase change slowly that departure from thermodynamic equilibrium can its temperature remains constant the system supplied with latent heat conversely loss heat from closed without phase without change and without change external force fields acting decreases its temperature for bodies steady state but not thermodynamic equilibrium while for bodies their own thermodynamic equilibrium the notion temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree which two bodies the hotter that they are the same this requirement not safe for bodies that are steady states though not thermodynamic can then well that different empirical thermometers disagree about which the and this then least one the bodies does not have well defined absolute thermodynamic nevertheless any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions non hotness and for suitable range this matter for study non equilibrium thermodynamics temperature for bodies not steady state when body not steady then the notion temperature becomes even less safe than for body steady state not thermodynamic this also matter for study non equilibrium thermodynamics thermodynamic equilibrium axiomatics for axiomatic treatment thermodynamic since the has become customary refer zeroth law thermodynamics the customarily stated minimalist version such law postulates only that all which when thermally connected would thermal should said have the same temperature but itself does not establish temperature quantity expressed real number more physically informative version such law views empirical temperature chart hotness while the zeroth law permits the definitions many different empirical scales the second law thermodynamics selects the definition single absolute temperature unique arbitrary scale whence called the thermodynamic temperature internal energy considered function the volume and entropy homogeneous system thermodynamic thermodynamic absolute temperature appears the partial derivative internal energy with respect the entropy constant its intrinsic origin null point absolute zero which the entropy any system although this the lowest absolute temperature described the the third law

temperature water one kelvin equal one degree requires joules per kilogram temperature measurement timeline temperature and pressure measurement technology international temperature scale comparison temperature scales temperature measurement using modern scientific thermometers and temperature scales goes back least far the early when gabriel fahrenheit adapted thermometer switching mercury and scale both developed ole christensen mer fahrenheit scale still use the united states for scientific temperature measured with thermometers that may calibrated variety temperature scales most the world except for belize myanmar liberia and the united states the celsius scale used for most temperature measuring most scientists measure temperature using the celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the kelvin scale which the celsius scale offset that its null point absolute zero many engineering fields the notably tech and federal specifications civil and also use the kelvin and celsius other engineering fields the also rely upon the rankine scale shifted fahrenheit when working related disciplines such combustion units the basic unit temperature the international system units the kelvin has the symbol for everyday often convenient use the celsius which corresponds very closely the freezing point water and its boiling point sea because liquid droplets commonly exist clouds zero better defined the melting point this scale temperature difference degree celsius the same kelvin increment but the scale offset the temperature which ice melts international agreement the kelvin and celsius scales are defined two fixing absolute zero and the triple point vienna standard mean ocean water which water specially prepared with specified blend hydrogen and oxygen absolute zero defined precisely and the temperature which all classical translational motion the particles comprising matter ceases and they are complete rest the classical quantum however zero point motion remains and has associated the zero point energy matter its ground state and contains thermal energy the triple point water defined and this definition serves the following fixes the magnitude the kelvin being precisely part parts the difference between absolute zero and the triple point establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude one degree the celsius and establishes the difference between the null points these scales being and the united the fahrenheit scale widely this scale the freezing point water corresponds and the boiling point the rankine still used fields chemical engineering the absolute scale based the fahrenheit conversion the following table shows the temperature conversion formulas for conversions and from the celsius celsius plasma physics the field plasma physics deals with phenomena electromagnetic nature that involve very high customary express temperature electronvolts kiloelectronvolts where the study qcd matter one routinely encounters temperatures the order few hundred mev equivalent about theoretical foundation thermodynamic temperature there are several scientific approaches the explanation the classical thermodynamic description based macroscopic empirical variables that can measured the kinetic theory gases which relates the macroscopic description the probability distribution the energy motion gas and microscopic explanation based statistical physics and quantum mechanics rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided axiomatic approach classical thermodynamics and statistical physics provides deeper understanding describing the atomic behavior and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages microscopic including both classical and quantum the fundamental physical using natural units temperature may measured directly units however the practical systems measurement for technology and such the modern metric system the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated the boltzmann constant proportionality factor that scales temperature the microscopic mean kinetic the microscopic description statistical mechanics based model that analyzes system into its fundamental particles matter into set classical quantum mechanical oscillators and considers the system statistical ensemble microstates collection classical material temperature measure the mean energy called kinetic energy the whether liquids gases the kinetic concept classical mechanics half the mass particle times its speed squared this mechanical interpretation thermal the kinetic energies material particles may reside the velocity the particles their translational vibrational motion the inertia their rotational monatomic perfect gases and approximately most temperature measure the mean particle kinetic also determines the probability distribution function the condensed and particularly this purely mechanical description often less useful and the oscillator model provides better description account for quantum mechanical temperature determines the statistical occupation the microstates the the microscopic definition temperature only meaningful the thermodynamic limit meaning for large ensembles states fulfill the requirements the statistical the context the kinetic energy also referred thermal energy the thermal energy may partitioned into independent components attributed the degrees freedom the particles the modes oscillators thermodynamic system the number these degrees freedom that are available for the equipartitioning energy depend the the energy region the interactions under for the thermal energy associated primarily with the vibrations its atoms molecules about their equilibrium ideal monatomic gas the kinetic energy found exclusively the purely translational motions the other vibrational and rotational motions also contribute degrees kinetic theory gases kinetic theory maxwell and boltzmann developed kinetic theory that yields fundamental understanding temperature this theory also explains the ideal gas law and the observed heat capacity monatomic gases the ideal gas law based observed empirical relationships between pressure volume and temperature and was recognized long before the kinetic theory gases was developed see boyle and charles laws the ideal gas law where the number moles gas and mol the gas constant this relationship gives our first hint that there absolute zero the temperature because only holds the temperature measured absolute scale such the ideal gas law allows one measure temperature this absolute scale using the gas thermometer the temperature kelvins can defined the pressure pascals one mole gas container one cubic divided the gas although not particularly convenient the gas thermometer provides essential theoretical basis which all thermometers can practical matter not possible use gas thermometer measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend condense into liquid long before the temperature reaches however extrapolate absolute zero using the ideal gas shown the the kinetic theory assumes that pressure caused the force associated with individual atoms striking the and that all energy translational kinetic energy using sophisticated symmetry boltzmann deduced what now called the maxwell boltzmann probability distribution function for the velocity particles ideal from that probability distribution function the average kinetic energy per monatomic ideal gas where the boltzmann constant the avogadro number divided the ideal gas constant and the root square speed thus the ideal gas law states that internal energy directly proportional this direct proportionality between temperature and internal energy special case the equipartition theorem and holds only the classical limit ideal gas does not hold for most although true that temperature monotonic function internal energy zeroth law thermodynamics zeroth law thermodynamics when two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together rigid physical path impermeable there spontaneous transfer energy heat from the hotter the colder eventually they reach state mutual thermal equilibrium which heat transfer has and the respective state variables have settled become one statement the zeroth law thermodynamics that two systems are each thermal equilibrium with third then they are also thermal equilibrium with each this statement helps define temperature but does complete the empirical temperature numerical scale for the hotness thermodynamic such hotness may defined existing one dimensional manifold stretching between hot and sometimes the zeroth law stated include the existence unique universal hotness and numerical scales provide complete definition empirical suitable for empirical material must have monontonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state such pressure when all other relevant coordinates are exceptionally suitable system the ideal gas which can provide temperature scale that matches the absolute kelvin the kelvin scale defined the basis the second law second law thermodynamics second law thermodynamics the previous section certain properties temperature were expressed the zeroth law also possible define temperature terms the second law thermodynamics which deals with entropy entropy often thought measure the disorder the second law states that any process will result either change net increase the entropy the this can understood terms for series coin perfectly ordered system would one which either every toss comes heads every toss comes this means that for perfectly ordered set coin there only one set toss outcomes the set which tosses come the the other there are multiple combinations that can result disordered mixed where some fraction are heads and the rest disordered system can heads and tails could heads and tails the number coin tosses the number possible combinations corresponding imperfectly ordered systems for very large number coin the combinations heads and tails dominates and obtaining outcome significantly different from becomes extremely thus the system naturally progresses state maximum disorder has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer heat between two systems and was just shown that the universe tends progress maximize which expected any natural thus expected that there some relationship between temperature and find this the relationship between work and temperature first heat engine device for converting thermal energy into mechanical resulting the performance and analysis the carnot heat engine provides the necessary the work from heat engine corresponds the difference between the heat put into the system the high and the heat ejected the low the efficiency the work divided the heat put into the system where the work done per the efficiency depends only because and correspond heat transfer the temperatures and respectively should some function these carnot theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally thus heat engine operating between and must have the same efficiency one consisting two one between and and the second between and this can only the case which since the first function independent this temperature must cancel the right meaning the form where function single temperature scale can now chosen with the property substituting equation back into equation gives relationship for the efficiency terms notice that for the efficiency and that efficiency becomes greater than below since efficiency greater than violates the first law this implies that the minimum possible fact the lowest temperature ever obtained macroscopic system was which was achieved subtracting the right hand side equation from the middle portion and rearranging where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the this relationship suggests the existence state defined where the subscript indicates reversible the change this state function around any cycle necessary for any state this function corresponds the entropy the which was described rearranging equation gives new definition for temperature terms entropy and for where entropy function its energy the temperature given the reciprocal the temperature the rate increase entropy with respect definition from statistical mechanics statistical mechanics defines temperature based fundamental degrees the defining relation can derived from the principles underlying the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalized temperature from single particle statistics possible extend the definition temperature even systems few like quantum dot the generalized temperature obtained considering time ensembles instead configuration space ensembles given statistical mechanics the case thermal and particle exchange between small system fermions even less than with double occupancy the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble obtained under the hypothesis ergodicity and allows express the generalized temperature from the ratio the average time occupation and the double occupancy where the fermi energy which tends the ordinary temperature when goes negative temperature negative temperature the empirical temperature which are not referenced absolute negative temperature one below the point the scale for dry ice has sublimation temperature which equivalent the absolute kelvin however this temperature the absolute scale thermodynamic temperature material can exhibit temperature smaller than equal both which are forbidden the third law thermodynamics the quantum mechanical description electron and nuclear spin systems that have limited number possible and therefore discrete upper limit energy they can possible obtain negative temperature which numerically indeed less than absolute however this not the macroscopic temperature the but instead the temperature only very specific degrees that are isolated from others and not exchange energy virtue the equipartition theorem negative temperature experimentally achieved with suitable radio frequency techniques that cause population inversion spin states from the ground the energy the system increases upon population the upper the entropy increases the system becomes less but attains maximum value when the spins are evenly distributed among ground and excited after which begins once again achieving state higher order the upper states begin fill the point maximum the temperature function shows the behavior singularity because the slope the entropy function decreases zero first and then turns since temperature the inverse the derivative the the temperature formally goes infinity this and switches negative infinity the slope turns energies higher than this the spin degree freedom therefore exhibits formally negative thermodynamic the energy increases further continued population the excited the negative temperature approaches zero the energy the system increases the population system with negative temperature not colder than absolute but rather has higher energy than positive and may said fact hotter negative when brought into contact with system positive energy will
