problems physics over the past few two theoretical frameworks have been developed most closely resemble the two theories upon which all modern physics rests are general relativity and quantum field theory theoretical framework that only focuses the force gravity for understanding the universe regions both scale and stars galaxies clusters etc the other qft theoretical framework that only focuses three gravitational forces for understanding the universe regions both small scale and low sub atomic atoms molecules etc qft successfully implemented the standard model and unified the interactions called grand unified theory between the three gravitational weak strong and electromagnetic force through years physicists have experimentally confirmed with tremendous accuracy virtually every prediction made these two theories when their appropriate domains accordance with their scientists also learned that and they are currently are mutually incompatible they cannot both since the usual domains applicability and qft are most situations require that only one the two theories turns this incompatibility between and qft only apparent issue regions extremely scale and such those that exist within black hole during the beginning stages the universe the moment immediately following the big bang resolve this theoretical framework revealing deeper underlying unifying gravity with the other three must discovered harmoniously integrate the realms and qft into seamless single theory capable describing all pursuit this quantum gravity has recently become area active over the past few single explanatory called string theory has emerged that may turn out the ultimate theory the many physicists believe the beginning the universe seconds after the big the four fundamental forces were once single fundamental unlike most not other string theory may its way successfully incorporating each the four fundamental forces into unified according string every particle the its most

references footnotes bibliography external links historical antecedents from ancient greece einstein archimedes was possibly the first scientist that known have described nature with axioms and then deduce new results from thus tried describe everything starting from few any theory similarly expected based axioms and deduce all observable phenomena from the concept introduced democritus unified all phenomena observed nature the motion ancient greek times philosophers speculated that the apparent diversity observed phenomena was due single type namely the collisions following atomism the mechanical philosophy the century posited that all forces could ultimately reduced contact forces between the then imagined tiny solid the late isaac newton description the distance force gravity implied that not all forces nature result from things coming into newton work his principia dealt with this further example this case unifying galileo work terrestrial kepler laws planetary motion and the phenomenon tides explaining these apparent actions distance under one single the law universal gravitation building these laplace famously suggested that sufficiently powerful intellect could knew the position and velocity every particle given along with the laws calculate the position any particle any other intellect which certain moment would know all forces that set nature and all positions all items which nature this intellect were also vast enough submit these data would embrace single formula the movements the greatest bodies the universe and those the tiniest for such intellect nothing would uncertain and the future just like the past would present before its essai philosophique sur les laplace thus envisaged combination gravitation and mechanics theory modern quantum mechanics implies that uncertainty inescapable and thus that vision needs theory everything must include gravitation and quantum hans christian rsted discovered connection between electricity and triggering decades work that culminated james clerk maxwell theory electromagnetism during the and early gradually became apparent that many common examples forces contact elasticity viscosity friction and pressure result from electrical interactions between the smallest particles his experiments michael faraday was the first search for unification gravity with electricity and however found david hilbert published famous list mathematical hilbert sixth problem challenged researchers find axiomatic basis all this problem thus asked for what today would called theory the late the new quantum mechanics showed that the chemical bonds between atoms were examples electrical justifying dirac boast that the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory large part physics and the whole chemistry are thus completely after when albert einstein published the theory gravity general relativity the search for unified field theory combining gravity with electromagnetism began with renewed the strong and the weak forces had not yet been but found the potential existence two other distinct forces gravity and far more this launched his year voyage search the called unified field that hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations one grand underlying during these last few decades his this quixotic quest isolated einstein from the mainstream understandably the mainstream was instead far more excited about the newly emerging framework quantum einstein wrote friend the early have become lonely old chap who mainly known because wear socks and who exhibited curiosity special prominent contributors were gunnar hermann weyl arthur eddington theodor kaluza oskar klein and most albert einstein and his einstein intensely searched but ultimately failed unifying more than half century einstein dream discovering unified theory has become the holy grail modern twentieth century and the nuclear interactions the twentieth the search for unifying theory was interrupted the discovery the strong and weak nuclear forces which differ both from gravity and from further hurdle was the acceptance that quantum mechanics had incorporated from the rather than emerging consequence deterministic unified einstein had gravity and electromagnetism could always peacefully coexist entries list classical but for many years seemed that gravity could not even incorporated into the quantum let alone unified with the other fundamental for this work for much the twentieth focused understanding the three quantum forces electromagnetism and the weak and strong the first two were combined sheldon glashow steven weinberg and abdus salam into the electroweak force electroweak unification broken symmetry the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct low energies because the particles carrying the weak the and bosons have zero masses and whereas the photon which carries the electromagnetic higher energies and can created easily and the unified nature the force becomes while the strong and electroweak forces peacefully coexist the standard model particle they remain the quest for theory everything thus unsuccessful two neither unification the strong and electroweak which laplace would have called contact has been nor unification these forces with gravitation has been modern physics conventional sequence theories theory everything would unify all the fundamental interactions gravitation strong interaction weak interaction and electromagnetism because the weak interaction can transform elementary particles from one kind into the toe should also yield deep understanding the various different kinds possible the usual assumed path theories given the following where each unification step leads one level quantum gravity gravitation gut strong interaction electroweak interaction weak interaction electromagnetism electricity magnetism this electroweak unification occurs around gev grand unification predicted occur gev and unification the gut force with gravity expected the planck energy roughly gev several grand unified theories have been proposed unify electromagnetism and the weak and strong grand unification would imply the existence electronuclear expected set energies the order gev far greater than could reached any possible based particle accelerator although the simplest guts have been experimentally ruled the general especially when linked with supersymmetry remains favorite candidate the theoretical physics supersymmetric guts seem plausible not only for their theoretical beauty but because they naturally produce large quantities dark and because the inflationary force may related gut physics although does not seem form inevitable part the yet guts are clearly not the final both the current standard model and all proposed guts are quantum field theories which require the problematic technique renormalization yield sensible this usually regarded sign that these are only effective field theories omitting crucial phenomena relevant only very high the final step the graph requires resolving the separation between quantum mechanics and often equated with general relativity numerous researchers concentrate their efforts this specific nevertheless accepted theory quantum gravity and thus accepted theory has emerged usually assumed that the toe will also solve the remaining problems addition explaining the forces listed the toe may also explain the status least two candidate forces suggested modern cosmology inflationary force and dark energy furthermore cosmological experiments also suggest the existence dark matter supposedly composed fundamental particles outside the scheme the standard however the existence these forces and particles has not been proven string theory and theory list unsolved problems physics string theory superstring theory theory some other variant this step the road theory just blind since the many physicists believe that dimensional theory which described some limits one the five perturbative superstring theories and another the supersymmetric dimensional supergravity the theory however there widespread consensus this surprising property string theory that extra dimensions are required for the this string theory can seen building the insights the kaluza klein theory which was realized that applying general relativity dimensional universe with one them small and curled looks from the dimensional perspective like the usual general relativity together with maxwell electrodynamics this lent credence the idea unifying gauge and gravity interactions and extra but address the detailed experimental another important property string theory its supersymmetry which together with extra dimensions are the two main proposals for resolving the hierarchy problem the standard model which the question why gravity much weaker than any other the dimensional solution involves allowing gravity propagate into the other dimensions while keeping other forces confined dimensional idea that has been realized with explicit stringy research into string theory has been encouraged variety theoretical and experimental the experimental the particle content the standard model supplemented with neutrino masses fits into spinor representation subgroup that routinely emerges string such heterotic string theory sometimes theory string theory has mechanisms that may explain why fermions come three hierarchical and explain the mixing rates between quark the theoretical has begun address some the key questions quantum gravity such resolving the black hole information paradox counting the correct entropy black holes and allowing for topology changing has also led many insights pure mathematics and strongly coupled gauge theory due the gauge string duality the late was noted that one major hurdle this endeavor that the number possible dimensional universes incredibly the curled extra dimensions can compactified enormous number different ways one estimate each which leads different properties for the energy particles and this array models known the string theory landscape one proposed solution that many all these possibilities are realised one another huge number but that only small number them are and hence the fundamental constants the universe are ultimately the result the anthropic principle rather than dictated this has led criticism string arguing that cannot make useful original falsifiable and predictions and regarding pseudoscience others and string theory remains extremely active topic investigation theoretical physics loop quantum gravity current research loop quantum gravity may eventually play fundamental role but that not its primary also loop quantum gravity introduces lower bound the possible length there have been recent claims that loop quantum gravity may able reproduce features resembling the standard model far only the first generation fermions leptons and quarks with correct parity properties have been modelled sundance thompson using preons constituted braids spacetime the building however there derivation the lagrangian that would describe the interactions such nor possible show that such particles are nor that the gauge groups interactions the standard model are utilization quantum computing concepts made possible demonstrate that the particles are able survive quantum fluctuations this model leads interpretation electric and colour charge topological quantities electric number and chirality twists carried the individual ribbons and colour variants such twisting for fixed electric bilson original paper suggested that the generation fermions could represented more complicated although explicit constructions these structures were not the electric colour and parity properties such fermions would arise the same way for the first the model was expressly generalized for infinite number generations and for the weak force bosons but not for photons paper hackett kauffman and other attempts any toe must include general relativity and the standard model particle recent and very prolific attempt called causal sets some the approaches mentioned its direct goal necessarily achieve toe but primarily working theory quantum which might eventually include the standard model and become candidate for its founding principle that spacetime fundamentally discrete and that the spacetime events are related partial order this partial order has the physical meaning the causality relations between relative past and future distinguishing spacetime outside the previously mentioned attempts there garrett proposal this theory provides attempt identifying general relativity and the standard model within the lie group the theory provide novel quantization procedure and the author suggests its quantization might follow the loop quantum gravity approach above christoph strand model attempts account for the gauge symmetry the standard model particle with the three reidemeister moves knot present status there candidate theory everything that includes the standard model particle physics and general for candidate theory able calculate the fine structure constant the mass the most particle physicists expect that the outcome the ongoing experiments the search for new particles the large particle accelerators and for dark matter are needed order provide further input for theory everything and philosophy theory everything the philosophical implications physical toe are frequently for philosophical physicalism physical toe will coincide with philosophical theory the system style metaphysics attempts answer all the important questions coherent providing complete picture the plato and aristotle could said have created early examples comprehensive the early modern period and the building scope philosophy often linked the rationalist method which the technique deducing the nature the world pure priori reason examples from the early modern period include the leibniz monadology descarte dualism and spinoza monism hegel absolute idealism and whitehead process philosophy were later arguments against theory everything parallel the intense search for various scholars have seriously debated the possibility its incompleteness theorem number scholars claim that incompleteness theorem suggests that any attempt construct toe bound informally asserts that any formal theory expressive enough for elementary arithmetical facts expressed and strong enough for them proved either inconsistent both statement and its denial can derived from its the sense that there true statement that derived the formal stanley jaki his book the relevance physics pointed out because any theory will certainly consistent trivial mathematical must claims that this dooms searches for deterministic theory later jaki states that wrong say that final theory but rather that when hand one cannot know rigorously that final freeman dyson has stated that stephen hawking was originally believer the theory everything after considering concluded that one was not del and the end physics rgen schmidhuber has argued against this points out that theorems are irrelevant for computable physics schmidhuber explicitly constructed deterministic universes whose pseudo randomness based undecidable like halting problems extremely hard detect but does not all prevent formal toes describable very few bits related critique was offered solomon feferman among douglas robertson offers conway game life the underlying rules are simple and but there are formally undecidable questions about the analogously may may possible completely state the underlying rules physics with finite number defined but there little doubt that there are questions about the behavior physical systems which are formally undecidable the basis those underlying since most physicists would consider the statement the underlying rules suffice the definition theory most physicists argue that theorem does not mean that toe cannot the other the scholars invoking theorem least some referring not the underlying but the understandability the behavior all physical when hawking mentions arranging blocks into turning the computation prime numbers into physical this definitional discrepancy may explain some the disagreement among fundamental limits accuracy physical theory date believed precisely instead physics has proceeded series successive allowing more and more accurate predictions over wider and wider range some physicists believe that therefore mistake confuse theoretical models with the true nature and hold that the series approximations will never terminate the truth einstein himself expressed this view following this may reasonably hope for theory everything which consistently incorporates all currently known but should not expect the final the other hand often claimed despite the apparently increasing complexity the mathematics each new deep sense associated with their underlying gauge symmetry and the number fundamental physical constants the theories are becoming this the the process simplification cannot continue lack fundamental laws there philosophical debate within the physics community whether theory everything deserves called the fundamental law the one view the hard reductionist position that the toe the fundamental law and that all other theories that apply within the universe are consequence the another view that emergent laws which govern the behavior complex systems should seen equally examples emergent laws are the second law thermodynamics and the theory natural selection the advocates emergence argue that emergent especially those describing complex living systems are independent the microscopic this emergent laws are fundamental the debates not make the point issue possibly the only issue stake the right apply the status term fundamental the respective subjects known one took place between steven weinberg and philip anderson citation needed impossibility being although the name theory suggests the determinism this gives very misleading determinism frustrated the probabilistic nature quantum mechanical the extreme sensitivity initial conditions that leads mathematical chaos the limitations due event and the extreme mathematical difficulty applying the thus although the current standard model particle physics predicts almost all known gravitational practice only few quantitative results have been derived from the full theory the masses some the simplest hadrons and these results especially the particle masses which are most relevant for energy are less accurate than existing experimental the toe would almost certainly even harder apply for the prediction experimental and thus might limited motive for seeking citation needed apart from the pure intellectual satisfaction completing long that prior examples unification have predicted new some which electrical generators have proved great practical and like these prior examples the toe would probably allow confidently define the domain validity and residual error energy approximations the full infinite number onion layers lee smolin regularly argues that the layers nature may like the layers and that the number layers might citation needed this would imply infinite sequence physical the argument not universally because not obvious that infinity concept
