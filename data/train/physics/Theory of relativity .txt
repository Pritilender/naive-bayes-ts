physics	theory relativity navigation search relativism the einstein theory relativity dimensional dimensional the theory relativity simply relativity usually encompasses two theories albert einstein special relativity and general relativity the word relativity can also used the context older that galilean invariance concepts introduced the theories relativity measurements various quantities are relative the velocities space contracts and time dilates spacetime space and time should considered together and relation each the speed light nonetheless the same for all the term theory was based the expression relative german relativtheorie used max planck who emphasized how the theory uses the principle relativity the discussion section the same paper alfred bucherer used for the first time the expression theory german relativit tstheorie contents scope two theory view the theory relativity special relativity general relativity experimental evidence tests special relativity tests general relativity history everyday applications minority views see also references further reading external links scope the theory relativity transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the when first relativity superseded old theory mechanics created primarily isaac newton the field relativity improved the science elementary particles and their fundamental along with ushering the nuclear age with cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such neutron stars black holes and gravitational waves two theory view the theory relativity was representative more than single new physical theory there are some explanations for first special relativity was published and the final form general relativity was published second special relativity applies elementary particles and their whereas general relativity applies the cosmological and astrophysical including third special relativity was accepted the physics community this theory rapidly became significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists the new fields atomic physics nuclear physics and quantum mechanics conversely general relativity did not appear there appeared little applicability for experimentalists most applications were for astronomical seemed limited only making minor corrections predictions newtonian gravitation finally the mathematics general relativity appeared very consequently was thought that small number people the that could fully understand the theory but this has been discredited richard feynman then around critical resurgence interest occurred which has resulted making general relativity central physics and new mathematical techniques applicable the study general relativity substantially streamlined from physically discernible concepts were isolated from the mathematical also the discovery exotic astronomical phenomena which general relativity was helped catalyze this the astronomical phenomena included quasars the kelvin microwave background radiation pulsars and the discovery the first black hole candidates the theory relativity einstein stated that the theory relativity belongs class such employs analytic this means that the elements which comprise this theory are not based hypothesis but empirical the empirical discovery leads understanding the general characteristics natural mathematical models are then developed which separate the natural processes into mathematical therefore analytical means the necessary conditions that have satisfied are separate events must satisfy these experience should then match the the special theory relativity and the general theory relativity are stated special theory relativity applies all physical phenomena except the general theory provides the law and its relation other forces special relativity special relativity introduction special relativity special relativity theory the structure spacetime was introduced paper the electrodynamics moving bodies for the contributions many other physicists see history special relativity special relativity based two postulates which are contradictory classical mechanics the laws physics are the same for all observers uniform motion relative one another principle relativity the speed light vacuum the same for all regardless their relative motion the motion the light source the resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical the michelson morley experiment that supports postulate but also has many surprising some these relativity simultaneity two simultaneous for one may not simultaneous for another observer the observers are relative time dilation moving clocks are measured tick more slowly than stationary clock relativistic mass length contraction objects are measured shortened the direction that they are moving with respect the mass energy equivalence energy and mass are equivalent and maximum speed finite physical message field line can travel faster than the speed light the defining feature special relativity the replacement the galilean transformations classical mechanics the lorentz transformations see maxwell equations electromagnetism general relativity general relativity introduction general relativity general relativity theory gravitation developed einstein the years the development general relativity began with the equivalence principle under which the states accelerated motion and being rest gravitational field for example when standing the surface the are physically the upshot this that free fall inertial motion object free fall falling because that how objects move when there force being exerted instead this being due the force gravity the case classical mechanics this incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect each but objects free fall resolve this difficulty einstein first proposed that spacetime curved devised the einstein field equations which relate the curvature spacetime with the energy and momentum within some the consequences general relativity clocks run slower deeper gravitational this called gravitational time dilation orbits precess way unexpected theory this has been observed the orbit mercury and binary pulsars rays light bend the presence gravitational field rotating masses drag the spacetime around phenomenon termed frame dragging the universe expanding and the far parts are moving away from faster than the speed light technically general relativity theory gravitation whose defining feature its use the einstein field equations the solutions the field equations are metric tensors which define the topology the spacetime and how objects move experimental evidence tests special relativity tests special relativity morley experiment like all falsifiable scientific relativity makes predictions that can tested the case special these include the principle the constancy the speed and time the predictions special relativity have been confirmed numerous tests since einstein published his paper but three experiments conducted between and were critical its these are the michelson morley experiment the kennedy thorndike experiment and the ives stilwell experiment einstein derived the lorentz transformations from first principles but these three experiments allow the transformations induced from experimental maxwell equations the foundation classical electromagnetism describe light wave which moves with characteristic the modern view that light needs medium but maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated analogous sound propagating and ripples propagating the surface this hypothetical medium was called the luminiferous aether rest relative the fixed and through which the earth fresnel partial ether dragging hypothesis ruled out the measurement order effects and although observations order effects were possible maxwell thought they were too small detected with current the morley experiment was designed detect second order effects the aether the motion the aether relative the michelson designed instrument called the michelson interferometer accomplish the apparatus was more than accurate enough detect the expected but obtained null result when the first experiment was conducted and again although the failure detect aether wind was the results were accepted the scientific attempt salvage the aether fitzgerald and lorentz independently created hoc hypothesis which the length material bodies changes according their motion through the this was the origin fitzgerald lorentz contraction and their hypothesis had theoretical the interpretation the null result the morley experiment that the trip travel time for light isotropic independent but the result alone not enough discount the theory the aether validate the predictions special kennedy thorndike experiment while the morley experiment showed that the velocity light said nothing about how the magnitude the velocity changed different inertial frames the thorndike experiment was designed and was first performed roy kennedy and edward they obtained null and concluded that there effect unless the velocity the solar system space more than about half that the earth its that possibility was thought too coincidental provide acceptable from the null result their experiment was concluded that the trip time for light the same all inertial reference the stilwell experiment was carried out herbert ives and stilwell first and with better accuracy was designed test the transverse doppler effect the redshift light from moving source direction perpendicular its velocity which had been predicted einstein the strategy was compare observed doppler shifts with what was predicted classical and look for lorentz factor correction such correction was from which was concluded that the frequency moving atomic clock altered according special those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased other experiments for relativistic energy and momentum increase high time dilation moving particles and modern searches for lorentz violations tests general relativity tests general relativity general relativity has also been confirmed many the classic experiments being the perihelion precession mercury the deflection light the sun and the gravitational redshift other tests confirmed the equivalence principle and frame dragging history history special relativity history general relativity the history special relativity consists many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained albert michelson hendrik lorentz henri and culminated the theory special relativity proposed albert einstein and subsequent work max planck hermann minkowski and general relativity theory gravitation that was developed albert einstein between and with contributions many others after currently can said that far from being simply theoretical scientific interest requiring experimental the analysis relativistic effects time measurement important practical engineering concern the operation the global positioning systems such gps glonass and the forthcoming galileo well the high precision dissemination instruments ranging from electron microscopes particle accelerators simply will not work relativistic considerations are everyday applications the theory relativity used many our modern electronics such the global positioning system gps systems are made three the control the space and the user the space component consists satellites that are placed specific the control component consists station which all the data from the space component many relativistic effects occur gps since each the components different reference all the relativistic effects need accounted for that the gps works with the clocks used the gps systems need gps the gravitational field the earth has accounted there are relativistic effects within the satellite that space that need accounted for gps systems work with such precision because the theory minority views einstein contemporaries did not all accept his new theories however the theory relativity now considered cornerstone modern physics although widely acknowledged that einstein was the creator relativity its modern some believe that others deserve credit for see
