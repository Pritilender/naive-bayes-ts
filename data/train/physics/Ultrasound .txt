useful transducers generate and detect ultrasonic waves air and echolocation bats was discovered lazzaro spallanzani when demonstrated that bats hunted and navigated inaudible sound and not perception humans and animals humans the upper frequency limit humans approximately due limitations the middle ear auditory sensation can occur intensity ultrasound fed directly into the human skull and reaches the cochlea through bone conduction without passing through the middle children can hear some pitched sounds that older adults cannot because humans the upper limit pitch hearing tends decrease with american cell phone company has used this create ring signals supposedly only able heard younger but many older people can hear the which may because the considerable variation related deterioration the upper hearing the mosquito electronic device that uses high pitched frequency deter loitering young animals bats use variety ultrasonic ranging echolocation techniques detect their they can detect frequencies beyond possibly many insects have good ultrasonic hearing and most these are nocturnal insects listening for echolocating bats this includes many groups moths beetles praying mantids and lacewings upon hearing some insects will make evasive manoeuvres escape being ultrasonic frequencies trigger reflex action the noctuid moth that cause drop slightly its flight evade tiger moths also emit clicks which may disturb echolocation but may also other cases evade being eaten advertising the fact that they are poisonous emitting dogs with normal hearing can hear dog whistle exploits this

ultrasound and use such sounds their navigational system biosonar orient and capture porpoises have the highest known upper hearing around several types fish can detect the order clupeiformes members the subfamily alosinae shad have been shown able detect sounds while the other subfamilies herrings can hear only ultrasound speaker systems are sold electronic pest control devices which are claimed frighten away rodents and insects but there scientific evidence that the devices detection and ranging contact sensor ultrasonic level sensing system requires contact with the for many processes the
