observable from our vantage point the milky way size age contents structure and laws observable universe age the universe abundance the chemical elements the size the universe may the region visible from earth the observable universe sphere with radius about billion light years based where the expansion space has taken the most distant objects for the diameter typical galaxy light and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies million light years the milky way galaxy roughly light years and the nearest sister galaxy the milky the andromeda galaxy located roughly million light years there are probably more than billion galaxies the observable typical galaxies range from dwarfs with few ten million stars giants with one trillion stars all orbiting the center study astronomers estimated that the observable universe contains sextillion stars dark energy dark matter the observable matter spread homogeneously uniformly throughout the when averaged over distances longer than million however smaller matter observed form clumps cluster many atoms are condensed into stars most stars into most galaxies into clusters superclusters and finally the largest scale structures such the great wall galaxies the observable matter the universe also spread isotropically meaning that direction observation seems different from any each region the sky has roughly the same the universe also bathed highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum roughly kelvin the hypothesis that the scale universe homogeneous and isotropic known the cosmological principle which supported astronomical observations the present overall density the universe very roughly grams per cubic this energy appears consist dark energy dark matter and ordinary matter thus the density atoms the order single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters the properties dark energy and dark matter are largely dark matter gravitates ordinary and thus works slow the expansion the universe dark energy accelerates its expansion the current estimate the universe age billion years the universe has not been the same all times its for the relative populations quasars and galaxies have changed and space itself appears have expanded this expansion accounts for how bound scientists can observe the light from galaxy billion light years even that light has traveled for only billion the very space between them has this expansion consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted the photons emitted have been stretched longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their the rate this spatial expansion accelerating based studies type supernovae and corroborated other the relative fractions different chemical elements particularly the lightest atoms such hydrogen deuterium and helium seem identical throughout the universe and throughout its observable the universe seems have much more matter than antimatter asymmetry possibly related the observations violation the universe appears have net electric charge and therefore gravity appears the dominant interaction cosmological length the universe also appears have neither net momentum nor angular momentum the absence net charge and momentum would follow from accepted physical laws gauss law and the divergence the stress momentum pseudotensor respectively the universe were elementary particles leptons quarks matter protons neutrons atomic nuclei electron gauge bosons gauge symmetry higgs boson mass graviton gravity the universe appears have smooth space time continuum consisting three spatial dimensions and one temporal time dimension the space observed very nearly flat close zero curvature meaning that euclidean geometry experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most the spacetime also appears have simply connected topology least the scale the observable however present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have multiply connected global analogy with the cylindrical toroidal topologies dimensional spaces the universe appears behave manner that regularly follows set physical laws and physical constants according the prevailing standard model all matter composed three generations leptons and quarks both which are fermions these elementary particles interact via most three fundamental interactions the electroweak interaction which includes electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force described quantum chromodynamics and gravity which best described present general relativity the first two interactions can described renormalized quantum field theory and are mediated gauge bosons that correspond particular type gauge symmetry renormalized quantum field theory general relativity has not yet been the theory special relativity believed hold throughout the provided that the spatial and temporal length scales are sufficiently otherwise the more general theory general relativity must there explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear have throughout our such planck

models the cosmos and its origin have been based the available data and conceptions the historically cosmologies and cosmogonies were based narratives gods acting various theories impersonal universe governed physical laws were first proposed the greeks and over the improvements astronomical observations and theories motion and gravitation led ever more accurate descriptions the the modern era cosmology began with albert general theory relativity which made possible quantitatively predict the evolution and conclusion the universe most accepted theories cosmology are based general relativity more the predicted big bang however still more careful measurements are required determine which theory creation creation myth creator deity many cultures have stories describing the origin the world which may roughly grouped into common one type the world born from world egg such stories include the finnish epic poem kalevala the chinese story pangu the indian brahmanda purana related the universe created single entity emanating producing something the tibetan buddhism concept adi buddha the ancient greek story gaia mother the aztec goddess coatlicue myth the ancient egyptian god atum story the genesis creation narrative another type the universe created from the union male and female the maori story rangi and papa other the universe created crafting from existing such the corpse dead from tiamat the babylonian epic enuma elish from the giant ymir norse mythology from chaotic izanagi and izanami japanese mythology other the universe emanates from fundamental such brahman and prakrti the creation myth the serers the yin and yang the tao philosophical models cosmology socratic philosophy physics hindu cosmology islamic cosmology time from the century the pre socratic greek philosophers developed the earliest known philosophical models the the earliest greek philosophers noted that appearances can and sought understand the underlying reality behind the they noted the ability matter change forms ice water and several philosophers proposed that all the apparently different materials the world are different forms single primordial arche the first was thales who proposed this material water thales student anaximander proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron anaximenes proposed air account its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche condense dissociate into different anaxagoras proposed the principle nous heraclitus proposed fire and spoke logos empedocles proposed the earth water air and his four element theory became very like pythagoras plato believed that all things were composed number with the elements taking the form the platonic solids democritus and later most notably leucippus proposed that the universe was composed indivisible atoms moving through void vacuum aristotle did not believe that was feasible because like offers resistance motion air will immediately rush fill and without would indefinitely although heraclitus argued for eternal his contemporary parmenides made the radical suggestion that all change that the true underlying reality eternally unchanging and single parmenides denoted this reality the parmenides theory seemed implausible many but his student zeno elea challenged them with several famous paradoxes aristotle responded these paradoxes developing the notion potential countable well the infinitely divisible unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles believed the world was bounded the celestial and thus magnitude was only finitely the indian philosopher kanada founder the vaisheshika school developed theory atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties the same the century the buddhist atomist philosopher dign proposed atoms durationless and made they denied the existence substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted momentary flashes stream the theory temporal finitism was inspired the doctrine creation shared the three abrahamic religions judaism christianity and islam the christian philosopher john philoponus presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient greek notion infinite past and philoponus arguments against infinite past were used the early muslim philosopher kindi the jewish philosopher saadia gaon saadia ben and the muslim theologian ghazali borrowing from physics and metaphysics they employed two logical arguments against infinite the first being the argument from the impossibility the existence actual which the second the argument from the impossibility completing actual infinite successive states both arguments were adopted christian philosophers and and the second argument particular became more famous after was adopted immanuel kant his thesis the first antinomy concerning time astronomical models history astronomy aristarchus astronomical models the universe were proposed soon after astronomy began with the babylonian astronomers who viewed the universe flat disk floating the and this forms the premise for early greek maps like those anaximander and hecataeus miletus later greek philosophers observing the motions the heavenly were concerned with developing models the universe based more profoundly empirical evidence the first coherent model was proposed eudoxus cnidos according physical interpretation the celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around stationary normal matter entirely contained within the terrestrial this model was also refined callippus and after concentric spheres were was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations ptolemy the success such model largely due the mathematical fact that any function such the position can decomposed into set circular functions the fourier modes other greek such the pythagorean philosopher philolaus postulated that the center the universe was central around which the earth sun moon and planets revolved uniform circular the greek astronomer aristarchus samos was the first known individual propose heliocentric model the though the original text has been reference book the sand reckoner describes heliocentric archimedes wrote translated into you king gelon are aware the the name given most astronomers the sphere the center which the center the while its radius equal the straight line between the center the sun and the center the this the common account you have heard from but aristarchus has brought out book consisting certain wherein consequence the assumptions that the universe many times greater than the just his hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain that the earth revolves about the sun the circumference the sun lying the middle the and that the sphere fixed situated about the same center the great that the circle which supposes the earth revolve bears such proportion the distance the fixed stars the center the sphere bears its aristarchus thus believed the stars very far and saw this the reason why there was parallax that observed movement the stars relative each other the earth moved around the the stars are fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed ancient which why stellar parallax only detectable with precision the geocentric consistent with planetary was assumed explanation for the unobservability the parallel stellar the rejection the heliocentric view was apparently quite the following passage from plutarch suggests the apparent face the orb the cleanthes contemporary aristarchus and head the thought was the duty the greeks indict aristarchus samos the charge impiety for putting motion the hearth the universe the supposing the heaven remain rest and the earth revolve oblique while the same about its own the only other astronomer from antiquity known name who supported heliocentric model was seleucus seleucia hellenistic astronomer who lived century after according plutarch seleucus was the first prove the heliocentric system through reasoning but not known what arguments seleucus arguments for heliocentric theory were probably related the phenomenon tides according strabo seleucus was the first state that the tides are due the attraction the and that the height the tides depends the position relative the alternatively may have proved the heliocentric theory determining the constants geometric model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods compute planetary positions using this like what nicolaus copernicus later did the during the middle ages heliocentric models may have also been proposed the indian astronomer aryabhata and the persian astronomers albumasar and sijzi model the copernican universe thomas digges planets the aristotelian model was accepted the western world for roughly two until copernicus revived theory that the astronomical data could explained more plausibly the earth rotated its axis and the sun were placed the center the revolutionibus orbium coelestrum noted copernicus the suggestion that the earth rotates was very dating least philolaus heraclides ponticus and ecphantus the pythagorean roughly century before christian scholar nicholas cusa also proposed that the earth rotates its axis his learned ignorance aryabhata brahmagupta albumasar and sijzi also proposed that the earth rotates its citation needed the first empirical evidence for the rotation its using the phenomenon comets was given tusi and ali qushji citation needed johannes kepler rudolphine tables tycho brahe this cosmology was accepted isaac newton christiaan huygens and later edmund halley and jean philippe cheseaux noted independently that the assumption infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead the prediction that the nighttime sky would bright the sun this became known olbers paradox the newton believed that infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter crushed inwards under its own this instability was clarified the jeans instability criterion one solution these paradoxes the charlier universe which the matter arranged hierarchically systems orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting larger infinitum fractal way such that the universe has negligibly small overall such cosmological model had also been proposed earlier johann heinrich lambert significant astronomical advance the century was the realization thomas wright immanuel kant and others nebulae the modern era physical cosmology began when albert einstein first applied his general theory relativity model the structure and dynamics the theoretical models cassini radio delayed space and time sun the four fundamental interactions gravitation dominant cosmological length that the other three forces play negligible role determining structures the level planetary galaxies and scale because all matter and energy gravity effects are the effects positive and negative charges tend cancel one making electromagnetism relatively insignificant cosmological length the remaining two the weak and strong nuclear forces decline very rapidly with their effects are confined mainly atomic length general theory relativity introduction general relativity general relativity field equations given predominance shaping cosmological accurate predictions the past and future require accurate theory the best theory available albert einstein general theory which has passed all experimental tests however because rigorous experiments have not been carried out cosmological length general relativity could conceivably nevertheless its cosmological predictions appear consistent with there compelling reason adopt another general relativity provides set ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric einstein field equations that must solved from the distribution mass energy and momentum throughout the because these are unknown exact cosmological models have been based the cosmological principle which states that the universe homogeneous and this principle asserts that the gravitational effects the various galaxies making the universe are equivalent those fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average the assumption uniform dust makes easy solve field equations and predict the past and future the universe cosmological time einstein field equations include cosmological constant that corresponds energy density empty depending its the cosmological constant can either slow negative accelerate positive the expansion the universe although many including had speculated that was recent astronomical observations type supernovae have detected large amount dark energy that accelerating the preliminary studies suggest that this dark energy corresponds positive although alternative theories cannot ruled out russian physicist zel dovich suggested that measure the zero point energy associated with virtual particles quantum field theory pervasive vacuum energy that exists even empty evidence for such point energy observed the casimir effect special relativity and time introduction special relativity special relativity the universe has least three spatial and one temporal time dimension was long thought that the spatial and temporal dimensions were different nature and independent one however according the special theory relativity spatial and temporal separations are interconvertible within changing understand this helpful consider the analogous interconversion spatial separations along the three spatial consider the two endpoints rod length the length can determined from the differences the three coordinates and the two endpoints given reference frame using the pythagorean theorem rotated reference the coordinate differences but they give the same length the coordinates differences and are not intrinsic the but merely reflect the reference frame used describe the length intrinsic property the the coordinate differences can changed without affecting the rotating reference the analogy spacetime called the interval between two event defined point specific position space and specific moment the spacetime interval between two events given where the speed according special relativity one can change spatial and time separation into another changing reference long the change maintains the spacetime interval such change reference frame corresponds changing moving lengths and times are different from their counterparts stationary reference the precise manner which the coordinate and time differences change with motion described the lorentz transformation solving field equations big bang ultimate fate the universe play media metric expansion the universe the distances between the spinning galaxies increase with but the distances between the stars within each galaxy stay roughly the due their gravitational this animation illustrates closed friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant such universe oscillates between big bang and big crunch cartesian curved coordinate the pythagorean theorem holds only infinitesimal length scales and must augmented with more general metric tensor which can vary from place place and which describes the local geometry the particular coordinate however assuming the cosmological principle that the universe homogeneous and isotropic every point space like every other hence the metric tensor must the same that leads single form for the metric called the friedmann walker metric where correspond spherical coordinate system this metric has only two undetermined overall length scale that can vary with and curvature index that can only corresponding flat euclidean geometry spaces positive negative curvature solving for the history the universe done calculating function given and the value the cosmological constant which parameter field the equation describing how varies with time known the friedmann equation after its alexander friedmann the solutions for depend and but some qualitative features such solutions are first and most the length scale the universe can remain constant only the universe perfectly isotropic with positive curvature and has one precise value density first noted albert einstein however this equilibrium unstable and because the universe known inhomogeneous smaller must according general relativity when changes all the spatial distances the universe change there overall expansion contraction space this accounts for the observation that galaxies appear flying the space between them the stretching space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can billion light years although they started from the same point billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed light second all solutions suggest that there was gravitational singularity the when goes zero and matter and energy became infinitely may seem that this conclusion uncertain because based the questionable assumptions perfect homogeneity and isotropy the cosmological and that only the gravitational interaction however the penrose hawking singularity theorems show that singularity should exist for very general hence according field grew rapidly from unimaginably dense state that existed immediately following this singularity when had finite this the essence the big bang model the common misconception that the big bang model predicts that matter and energy exploded from single point space and that rather space itself was created the big bang and imbued with fixed amount energy and matter distributed uniformly space expands increases the density that matter and energy space has that empirically more certain than any external however that does not imply that space original bernhard riemann the curvature index determines the sign the mean spatial curvature spacetime averaged over length scales greater than billion light years the curvature positive and the universe has finite such universes are often visualized three dimensional sphere embedded dimensional space conversely zero the universe may have infinite depending its overall topology may seem intuitive that infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could created single instant the big bang when but exactly that predicted mathematically when does not equal for infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite whereas infinite cylinder finite one direction and torus finite toroidal universe could behave like normal universe with periodic boundary conditions seen video games such asteroids traveler crossing outer boundary space going outwards would reappear instantly another point the boundary moving inwards spacetime the ultimate fate the universe still because depends critically the curvature index and the cosmological constant the universe sufficiently equals meaning that its average curvature throughout positive and the universe will eventually recollapse big crunch possibly starting new universe big bounce conversely the universe insufficiently equals and the universe will expand cooling off and eventually becoming inhospitable for all the stars die and all matter coalesces into black holes the big freeze and the heat death the universe noted recent data suggests that the expansion speed the universe not decreasing originally but this continues the universe will eventually rip itself shreds the big rip experimentally the universe has overall density that very close the critical value between recollapse and eternal more careful astronomical observations are needed resolve the big bang model big bang timeline the big bang nucleosynthesis cdm model the prevailing big bang model accounts for many the experimental observations described such the correlation distance and redshift the universal ratio helium and the isotropic microwave radiation noted the redshift arises from the metric expansion space the space itself the wavelength photon traveling through space likewise decreasing its the longer photon has been the more expansion has hence older photons from more distant galaxies are the most determining the correlation between distance and redshift important problem experimental physical cosmology relative abundances atomic nuclei other experimental observations can explained combining the overall expansion space with nuclear and atomic physics the universe the energy density the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that matter because the energy photon decreases with its thus although the energy density the universe now dominated was once dominated poetically all was light the universe its energy density decreased and became did the elementary particles matter could associate stably into ever larger thus the early part the dominated stable protons and neutrons formed which then associated into atomic nuclei this the matter the universe was mainly dense plasma negative electrons neutral neutrinos and positive nuclear reactions among the nuclei led the present abundances the lighter particularly hydrogen deuterium and helium eventually the electrons and nuclei combined form stable which are transparent most wavelengths this the radiation decoupled from the forming the isotropic background microwave radiation observed other observations are not answered definitively known according the prevailing slight imbalance matter over antimatter was present the developed very shortly possibly due the violation that has been observed particle physicists although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one producing photons small residue matter giving the present dominated several lines evidence also suggest that rapid cosmic inflation the universe occurred very early its history roughly seconds after its recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant not zero and that the net mass energy content the universe dominated dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized they differ their gravitational dark matter gravitates ordinary matter and thus slows the expansion the dark energy serves accelerate the multiverse theory multiverse worlds interpretation bubble universe theory
