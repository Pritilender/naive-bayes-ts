often with permanent displacement the particles the that with little associated mass they instead oscillations vibrations around almost fixed waves are described wave equation which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over the mathematical form this equation varies depending the type there are two main types mechanical waves propagate through and the substance this medium the deformation reverses itself owing restoring forces resulting from its for sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their when air molecules they also bounce away from each other restoring this keeps the molecules from continuing travel the direction the the second main type electromagnetic waves not require instead they consist periodic oscillations electrical and magnetic fields generated charged and can therefore travel through vacuum these types waves vary and include radio waves microwaves infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation rays and gamma rays further the

distinguished from optics that sound waves are related mechanical rather than electromagnetic wave transfer caused vibration concepts such mass momentum inertia elasticity become therefore crucial describing acoustic distinct from wave this difference origin introduces certain wave characteristics particular the properties the medium for the case vortices radiation pressure shock waves etc the

processes independently their physical for based the mechanical origin acoustic moving disturbance time can exist and only the medium involved neither infinitely stiff nor infinitely all the parts making medium were rigidly bound then they would all vibrate with delay the transmission the vibration and therefore wave the other all the parts were then there would not any transmission the vibration and wave although the above statements are meaningless the case waves that not require they reveal characteristic that relevant all waves regardless within the phase vibration that its position within the vibration different for adjacent points space because the vibration reaches these points different similarly wave processes revealed from the study waves other than sound waves can

dispersion independent amplitude linear media not nonlinear with constant waveform shape this wave can then described the dimensional functions more formula representing two component waveforms and traveling through the medium opposite generalized representation this wave can obtained the partial differential equation general solutions are based upon duhamel principle wave forms sine square triangle sawtooth the form shape formula involves the argument constant values this argument correspond constant values and these constant values occur increases the same rate that increases that the wave shaped like the function will move the positive direction velocity and will propagate the same speed the negative the case periodic function with period that the periodicity space means that snapshot the wave given time finds the wave varying periodically space with period the wavelength the similar this periodicity implies periodicity time provided observation the wave fixed location finds the wave undulating periodically time with period amplitude and modulation envelope carrier amplitude modulation frequency modulation phase modulation the amplitude wave may constant which case the wave continuous wave may modulated vary with time the outline the variation amplitude called the envelope the mathematically the modulated wave can written the where the amplitude envelope the the

exception occurs the location where the argument the exponential varies this observation the basis for the method stationary phase for evaluation such the condition for vary slowly that its rate change with this rate variation where the evaluation made because centered this result shows that the position where the phase changes the position where moves with time speed called the group velocity the group velocity therefore depends upon the dispersion relation connecting and for quantum mechanics the energy particle represented wave packet consequently for that wave the group velocity showing that the velocity localized particle quantum mechanics its group because the group velocity varies with the shape the wave packet broadens with and the particle becomes less other the

dispersion the sine wave the unique shape that will propagate unchanged but for phase and making easy due the kramers kronig relations linear medium with dispersion also exhibits the sine wave propagating dispersive medium attenuated certain frequency ranges that depend upon the the sine function the sine wave sinusoid has wavelength space and period the sinusoid defined for all times and whereas physical situations usually deal with waves that exist for limited span space and duration fortunately arbitrary wave shape can decomposed into infinite set sinusoidal waves the use fourier analysis the simple case single sinusoidal wave can applied more general many media are linear nearly the calculation arbitrary wave behavior can found adding responses individual sinusoidal waves using the superposition principle find the solution for general when medium nonlinear the response complex waves cannot determined from wave plane waves plane wave standing waves standing wave acoustic resonance helmholtz resonator organ pipe nodes standing also known stationary wave wave that remains constant this phenomenon can occur because the medium moving the opposite direction the can arise stationary medium result interference between two waves traveling opposite the sum two propagating waves equal amplitude and creates standing wave standing waves commonly arise when boundary blocks further propagation the thus causing wave and therefore introducing propagating for example when violin string transverse waves propagate out where the string held place the bridge and the nut where the waves are reflected the bridge and the two opposed waves are antiphase and cancel each producing node halfway between two nodes there antinode where the two propagating waves enhance each other there net propagation energy over one dimensional standing the fundamental mode and the first overtones dimensional standing wave disk this the fundamental standing wave disk with two nodal lines crossing the this physical properties waves exhibit common behaviors under number standard transmission and media rectilinear propagation transmittance transmission medium waves normally move

when wave with that same natural frequency impinges upon then the electrons that atom will set into vibrational wave given frequency strikes material with electrons having the same vibrational then those electrons will absorb the energy the wave and transform into vibrational reflection reflection when wave strikes reflective changes such that the angle made the incident wave and line normal the surface equals the angle made the reflected wave and the same normal interference interference wave waves that encounter each other combine through superposition create new wave called interference pattern important interference patterns occur for waves that are phase refraction refraction refraction the phenomenon wave changing its mathematically this means that the size the phase velocity changes typically refraction occurs when wave passes from one medium into the amount which wave refracted material given the refractive index the the directions incidence and refraction are related
