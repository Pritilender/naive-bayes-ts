the weak force weak nuclear force one the four fundamental interactions alongside the strong interaction electromagnetism and gravitation the weak interaction responsible for both the radioactive decay and nuclear fusion subatomic particles the theory the weak interaction sometimes called quantum flavordynamics qfd analogy with the terms qcd and qed but practice the term rarely used because the weak force best understood terms electro weak theory the standard model particle physics the weak interaction caused the emission absorption and bosons all known fermions interact through the weak fermions are particles that have spin one the fundamental properties all half integer fermion can elementary particle such the electron can composite particle such the proton the mass and bosons far heavier than that protons thus causing the range the weak the force termed weak because its field strength over given distance typically several orders magnitude less than that the strong nuclear force and electromagnetism during the quark epoch the electroweak force split into the electromagnetic and weak most fermions will decay weak interaction over important examples include beta decay and the production deuterium and then helium from hydrogen that powers the thermonuclear such decay also makes radiocarbon dating possible carbon decays through the weak interaction nitrogen can also create radioluminescence commonly used tritium illumination and the related field betavoltaics quarks which make composite particles like neutrons and come six flavours down strange charm top and bottom which give those composite particles their the weak interaction unique that allows for quarks swap their flavour for for during beta minus down quark decays into converting neutron the weak interaction the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity symmetry and the only one break symmetry contents history properties weak isospin and weak hypercharge interaction types charged current interaction neutral current interaction electroweak theory violation symmetry see also references citations general readers texts history enrico fermi proposed the first theory the weak known fermi interaction suggested that beta decay could explained fermion interaction involving contact force with however better described non contact force field having finite albeit very sheldon glashow abdus salam and steven weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction showing them two aspects single now termed the weak the existence the and bosons was not directly confirmed until properties ckm parameters the weak interaction unique number the only interaction capable changing the flavor quarks changing one type quark into the only interaction that violates symmetry also the only one that violates symmetry propagated carrier particles known gauge bosons that have significant unusual feature which explained the standard model the higgs mechanism due their large mass approximately these carrier termed the and are they have lifetime under the weak interaction has coupling constant indicator interaction between and compared the strong coupling constant about and the electromagnetic coupling constant about consequently the weak interaction weak terms the weak interaction has very short range around distances around meters the weak interaction has strength similar magnitude the electromagnetic but distances around the weak interaction times weaker than the the weak interaction affects all the fermions the standard model well the higgs boson neutrinos interact through gravity and the weak interaction and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force the weak interaction does not produce bound states nor does involve binding energy something that gravity does astronomical that the electromagnetic force does the atomic and that the strong nuclear force does inside its most noticeable effect due its first unique flavor changing neutron for heavier than proton its sister nucleon but cannot decay into proton without changing the flavor one its two down quarks neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour this must proceed weak decay without weak quark properties such strangeness and charm associated with the quarks the same would also conserved across all all mesons are unstable because weak the process known beta decay down quark the neutron can change into quark emitting virtual boson which then converted into electron and electron antineutrino due the large mass boson weak decay much more unlikely than strong electromagnetic and hence occurs less for neutral pion which decays has life about while charged pion which decays through the weak lives about hundred million times free neutron which also decays through the weak lives about weak isospin and weak hypercharge weak isospin handed fermions the standard model weak isospin weak isospin weak isospin electron muon tau electron neutrino muon neutrino tau neutrino quark charm quark top quark down quark strange quark bottom quark all particles have property called weak isospin which serves quantum number and governs how that particle interacts the weak weak isospin therefore plays the same role the weak interaction electric charge does electromagnetism and color charge the strong interaction all fermions have weak isospin value either for the quark has and the down quark quark never decays through the weak interaction into quark the same quarks with decay into quarks with and vice any given weak isospin conserved the sum the weak isospin numbers the particles entering the interaction equals the sum the weak isospin numbers the particles exiting that for with weak isospin normally decays into and handed following the development the electroweak another weak hypercharge was dependent electrical charge and weak and defined where the weak hypercharge given type its electrical charge elementary charge units and its weak whereas some particles have weak isospin all except have zero weak citation needed weak hypercharge the generator the component the electroweak gauge group citation needed interaction types there are two types weak interaction called vertices the first type called the charged current interaction because mediated particles that carry electric charge the bosons and responsible for the beta decay phenomenon the second type called the neutral current interaction because mediated neutral the boson charged current interaction feynman diagram neutron proton electron electron neutrino one type charged current charged lepton such electron muon having charge can absorb boson particle with charge and thereby converted into corresponding neutrino with charge where the type family neutrino muon the same the type lepton the for similarly type quark with charge can converted into type quark with charge emitting boson absorbing boson more the type quark becomes quantum superposition type that has possibility becoming any one the three type with the probabilities given the ckm matrix tables conversely type quark can emit boson absorb boson and thereby converted into type for the boson unstable will rapidly with very short for decay the boson other products can with varying the called beta decay neutron see above down quark within the neutron emits virtual boson and thereby converted into converting the neutron into because the energy involved the process the mass difference between the down quark and the the boson can only converted into electron and the quark the process can represented neutral current interaction neutral current interactions quark lepton electron muon emits absorbs neutral boson for like the the boson also decays for electroweak theory electroweak interaction the standard model particle physics describes the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction two different aspects single electroweak the theory which was developed around sheldon glashow abdus salam and steven weinberg they were awarded the nobel prize physics for their the higgs mechanism provides explanation for the presence three massive gauge bosons the three carriers the weak and the massless photon the electromagnetic according the electroweak very high the universe has four massless gauge boson fields similar the photon and complex scalar higgs field doublet however low gauge symmetry spontaneously broken down the symmetry electromagnetism one the higgs fields acquires vacuum expectation value this symmetry breaking would produce three massless bosons but they become integrated three like fields through the higgs mechanism giving them these three fields become the and bosons the weak while the fourth gauge which remains the photon this theory has made number including prediction the masses the and bosons before their july the cms and the atlas experimental teams the large hadron collider independently announced that they had confirmed the formal discovery previously unknown boson mass between gev whose behaviour far was consistent higgs while adding cautious note that further data and analysis were needed before positively identifying the new boson being higgs boson some march the higgs boson was tentatively confirmed exist violation symmetry left and handed particles spin the laws nature were long thought remain the same under mirror reflection the reversal all spatial axes the results experiment viewed via mirror were expected identical the results reflected copy the experimental this called law parity conservation was known respected classical gravitation electromagnetism and the strong interaction was assumed universal however the chen ning yang and tsung dao lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this chien shiung and collaborators discovered that the weak interaction violates earning yang and lee the nobel prize physics although the weak interaction used described fermi theory the discovery parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that new approach was robert marshak and george sudarshan and somewhat richard feynman and murray mann proposed vector minus axial vector lagrangian for weak this the weak interaction acts only handed particles and handed since the mirror reflection handed particle this explains the maximal violation interestingly the theory was developed before the discovery the did not include the handed fields that enter the neutral current however this theory allowed compound symmetry combines parity switching left with charge conjugation switching particles with physicists were again surprised when james cronin and val fitch provided clear evidence kaon decays that symmetry could broken winning them the nobel prize physics makoto kobayashi and toshihide maskawa showed that violation the weak interaction required more than two generations effectively predicting the existence then unknown third this discovery earned them half the nobel prize unlike parity violation occurs only small number but remains widely held answer the difference between the amount matter and antimatter the thus forms one andrei sakharov three conditions for baryogenesis see also weakless universe the postulate that weak interactions are not anthropically necessary
